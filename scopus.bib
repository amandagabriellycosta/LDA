abstract = {As offline control photovoltaic (PV) plants are not equipped with online communication and remote control systems, they cannot adjust their power in real-time. Therefore, in a distribution network saturated with offline control PVs, the distribution system operator (DSO) should schedule the distributed energy resources (DERs) considering the uncertainty of renewable energy to prevent curtailment due to overvoltage. This paper presents a day-ahead network operation strategy using a mobile energy storage system (MESS) and offline control PVs to minimize power curtailment. The MESS model efficiently considers the transportation time and power loss of the MESS, and models various operating modes, such as the charging, discharging, idle, and moving modes. The optimization problem is formulated based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) considering the spatial and temporal operation constraints of MESSs and is performed using chanced constrained optimal power flow (CC-OPF). The upper limits for offline control PVs are set based on the probabilistic approach, thus mitigating overvoltage due to forecasting errors. The proposed operation strategy was tested in the IEEE 33-node distribution system coupled with a 15-node transportation system. The test results show the effectiveness of the proposed method for minimizing curtailment in offline control PVs. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the maximum length car sequencing problem to support the assembly operations of a multinational automotive company. We propose an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to schedule the maximum number of cars without violating the so-called option constraints. In addition, we present valid combinatorial lower and upper bounds, which can be calculated in less than 0.01 s, as well as binary and iterative search algorithms to solve the problem when good primal bounds are not readily available. To quickly obtain high-quality solutions, we devise an effective iterated local search algorithm, and we use the heuristic solutions as warm start to further enhance the performance of the exact methods. Computational results demonstrate that relatively low gaps were achieved for benchmark instances within a time limit of ten minutes. We also conducted an instance space analysis to identify the features that make the problem more difficult to solve. Moreover, the instances reflecting the company's needs could be solved to optimality in less than a second. Finally, simulations with real-world demands, divided into shifts, were conducted over a period of four months. In this case, we use the proposed ILP model in all shifts except the last one of each month, for which we employ an alternative ILP model to sequence the unscheduled cars, adjusting the pace of the assembly line in an optimal fashion. The results pointed out that the latter was necessary in only one of the months. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {To meet the production demand of workshop, this paper proposes an efficient discrete artificial bee colony (DABC) algorithm to solve a new automatic guided vehicle (AGV) scheduling problem with delivery and pickup in a matrix manufacturing workshop. The goal is to produce a AGV transportation solution that minimizes the total cost, including travel cost, time cost, and AGV cost. Therefore, a mixed integer linear programming model is established. To improve the transportation efficiency, a dynamic calculation method is developed. In the DABC algorithm, a heuristic algorithm and a median based probability selection method are used. For improving the quality of the solutions, four effective neighborhood operators are introduced. In the local search, a rule is given to save the operation time and a problem-based search operator is proposed to improve the quality of the best individual. Finally, a series of comparison experiments were implemented with the iterative greedy algorithm, artificial bee colony algorithm, hybrid fruit fly optimization algorithm, discrete artificial bee colony algorithm, improved harmony search, and hybrid genetic-sweep algorithm. The results show that the proposed DABC algorithm has high performance on solving the delivery and pickup problem. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract = {Problem statement: Nowadays, devices generate copious quantities of high-speed data streams due to Internet of Things (IoT) applications. For the most part, cloud computing platforms handle and manage all of these data and requests. However, for certain applications, the data transmission delay that comes with transferring data from edge devices to the cloud could be unbearable. When there are a lot of devices connected to the internet, the public network actually becomes a bottleneck for data transfer. In this setting, power management, data storage, resource management, and service management all necessitate more robust infrastructure and complex processes. More efficient use of network and cloud resources is achievable with fog computing's “intelligent gateway” capability. Methodology: Planning and managing resources is one of the most important factors affecting system performance (especially latency) in a fog-cloud environment. Planning in an environment with fog and clouds is an NP-hard problem. This paper delves into the optimisation difficulty of longevity for data-intensive job scheduling in fog and cloud-based IoT systems. The issue is initially expressed as an optimisation model for integer linear programming (ILP). Next, we provide a heuristic algorithm known as DLJSF (Data-Locality Aware Job Scheduling in Fog-Cloud) that is based on the suggested formulation. Results: The results of the tests showed that the performance of the proposed algorithm is close to the results by an average of 87 %. Also, on average, it is 99.16 % better than the LP results obtained from the optimal solution obtained from the solver obtained from the solution that the data is processed locally. To check the efficiency of the simulation solution, it was repeated for tasks with different entry rates and data with different sizes. Conclusion: According to the obtained documents, the data transfer approach can be valuable and the proposed algorithm has not lost its performance in different conditions. © 2024 The Authors},

A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed to integrate academic year course schedule planning and instructor assignment, accommodating various constraints to meet student demands. The model optimizes the number of course sections and strategically schedules instructors, aiming to reduce the number of new and distinct courses assigned to them. Historical data from an academic department encompassing multiple disciplines, including Computer Information Systems, Business Management, and Business Analytics, at a large public university in the U.S. is used to develop the model, and the results are compared with the actual course schedule and instructor assignment. The results demonstrate that the proposed DSS would result in a 14 % reduction in the number of course sections offered, translating to approximately $130,000 in annual savings. Additionally, it could significantly reduce the number of new courses assigned to instructors by up to 81 % and the number of distinct course sections assigned to them by 29 %. © 2024},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel activity-based demand model that combines an optimisation framework for continuous temporal scheduling decisions (i.e. activity timings and durations) with traditional discrete choice models for non-temporal choice dimensions (i.e. activity participation, number and type of tours, and destinations). The central idea of our approach is that individuals resolve temporal scheduling conflicts that arise from overlapping activities, e.g. needing to work and desiring to shop at the same time, in order to maximise their daily utility. Flexibility parameters capture behavioural preferences that penalise deviations from desired timings. This framework has three advantages over existing activity-based modelling approaches: (i) the time conflicts between different temporal scheduling decisions including the activity sequence are treated jointly; (ii) flexibility parameters follow a utility maximisation approach; and (iii) the framework can be used to estimate and simulate a city-scale case study in reasonable time. We introduce an estimation routine that allows flexibility parameters to be estimated using real-world observations as well as a simulation routine to efficiently resolve temporal conflicts using an optimisation model. The framework is applied to the full-time workers of a synthetic population for the city of Lausanne, Switzerland. We validate the model results against reported schedules. The results demonstrate the capabilities of our approach to reproduce empirical observations in a real-world case study. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel decomposition method for two-stage stochastic mixed-integer optimization problems. The algorithm builds upon the idea of similarity between finite sample sets to measure how similar the first-stage decisions are among the uncertainty realization scenarios. Using such a Similarity Index, the non-anticipative constraints are removed from the problem formulation so that the original problem becomes block-separable on a scenario basis. Then, a term for maximizing the Similarity Index is included in all the sub-problems objective functions. Such sub-problems are solved iteratively in parallel so that their solutions are used to update the weighting parameter for maximizing the Similarity Index. The algorithm obtains a feasible solution when full similarity among scenario first stages is reached, that is, when the incumbent solution is non-anticipative. The proposal is tested in four instances of different sizes of an industrial-like scheduling problem. Comparison results show that the Similarity Index Decomposition provides significant speed-ups compared with the monolithic problem formulation, and provides simpler tuning and improved convergence over the Progressive Hedging Algorithm. © 2024 The Author(s)},

abstract = {The rapid growth in the number of electric vehicles (EVs), driven by the ‘double-carbon’ target, and the impact of uncontrolled charging and discharging behaviour and discharged battery losses severely limit electric vehicles’ low carbon characteristics. Existing research on systemic low-carbon emissions and electric vehicle charging and discharging issues is usually determined by considering only carbon trading markets or charging and discharging management on the source side. In this regard, a coordinated and optimized operation model that considers the participation of electric vehicle clusters in deep peaking and the source network load and storage adjustable resources is proposed. The upper layer establishes a real-time price-based demand response mechanism for the load side with the minimum net load fluctuation as the objective function; the middle layer establishes a comprehensive operation mechanism for the source and storage side that includes an orderly charging and discharging peaking compensation mechanism for electric vehicles, and a deep peaking mechanism that takes into account clean emission, and constructs an optimal operation model with the minimum comprehensive operating cost as the objective function; the lower layer establishes a distribution network loss minimization model for the network side that takes into account the orderly charging and discharging of electric vehicle as the objective function. The optimal load model with the objective function of minimizing the distribution network loss is established at the lower level. Finally, the original problem is transformed into a mixed integer linear programming problem, and the model's effectiveness is verified by setting different scenarios. The model reduces the total cost by 22.22%, improves the wind power consumption rate by 19.55%, reduces the actual carbon emission by 16.66%, and reduces the distribution network loss by 13.91% compared to the basic model. © 2024 The Authors.

abstract = {Answer-set programming (ASP) is a prominent approach to declarative problem solving that is increasingly used to tackle challenging optimisation problems. We present an approach to leverage ASP optimisation by using large-neighbourhood search (LNS), which is a meta-heuristic where parts of a solution are iteratively destroyed and reconstructed in an attempt to improve an overall objective. In our LNS framework, neighbourhoods can be specified either declaratively as part of the ASP encoding or automatically generated by code. Furthermore, our framework is self-adaptive, i.e., it also incorporates portfolios for the LNS operators along with selection strategies to adjust search parameters on the fly. The implementation of our framework, the system ALASPO, currently supports the ASP solver clingo, as well as its extensions clingo-dl and clingcon that allow for difference and full integer constraints, respectively. It utilises multi-shot solving to efficiently realise the LNS loop and in this way avoids program regrounding. We describe our LNS framework for ASP as well as its implementation, discuss methodological aspects, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive LNS approach for ASP on different optimisation benchmarks, some of which are notoriously difficult, as well as real-world applications for shift planning, configuration of railway-safety systems, parallel machine scheduling, and test laboratory scheduling. © 2024 The Author(s)},

In order to evaluate the performance of the ASFDBO algorithm, we performed a benchmark function test and a convergence analysis with other recognized metaheuristics. In addition, we verified the practical applicability of the ASFDBO algorithm in different test scenarios. Through numerical experiments, we analyze the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm’s scheduling solutions and improvement strategies. Results indicate that our collaborative scheduling optimization, which considers both carbon and production costs, achieves feasible solutions and reduces carbon expenses. Finally, we investigate the impact of different carbon tax rates on the joint scheduling optimization of berths and quay cranes, and the results show that a reasonable carbon tax policy can effectively reduce the carbon emissions of ports. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract = {Grid-scale energy storage is becoming an essential element to effectively support the rapid increased use of renewable energy sources in the power network. The present work proposes a long-term techno-economic profitability analysis considering the net profit stream of a grid-level battery energy storage system (BESS) performing energy arbitrage as a grid service. The net profit is a cost function that includes the revenue derived by arbitrage, the import cost and the degradation cost induced by battery capacity fade. Three optimization techniques with a computationally efficient optimization logic are developed. The scenario with no-degradation is formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem, while the scenarios with and without degradation are formulated as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), and as mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problems. The non-linearity is introduced by implementing a BESS dynamic charge/discharge efficiency that is a function of the BESS power rate. Based on the obtained BESS optimal scheduling, a long-term profitability analysis is developed during the whole BESS lifetime. In the proposed case study, historical electricity market prices from the CAISO electricity market in the United States, California, are used as input. We found that, even without degradation, the break-even investment cost that makes the BESS profitable with a power to-energy-ratio of 1 MW/2MWh is 210 $/kWh. By implementing a cycle-counting degradation model, we observed a remarkable battery degradation on BESS profitability corresponding to a yearly net profit reduction in the 13–24 % range. From a long-term application perspective, the BESS calendar lifetime could be extended by reducing the battery cycling. Such cycling reduction is obtained by adding a penalty cost in the objective function of the energy arbitrage optimization problem. © 2024 The Authors},

Researching the multi-objective optimization scheduling of cascade hydropower stations under various spatiotemporal inflow impacts is of significant importance. Previous studies have typically only focused on the economic dispatch issues of cascade hydropower stations, with little attention given to their coupling mechanism models and the uncertainty impacts of inflows. Firstly, this paper establishes a coupled optimization scheduling model for cascade hydropower stations and elaborates on the operational mechanism of cascade hydropower stations. Secondly, according to the needs of actual scenarios, two types of optimization objectives are set, considering both the supply adequacy and peak-shaving capacity as indicators, with the total residual load and the peak-valley difference of the residual load as comprehensive optimization objectives. Subsequently, considering the uncertainty impact of the inflow side, a stochastic optimization model for inflow is established based on a normal distribution probability. Finally, case study analyses demonstrate that the proposed model not only effectively achieves supply stability but also reduces the peak-valley difference in load, and can achieve optimized scheduling under the uncertain environment of inflow. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract = {The virtual power plants are aggregations of distributed generators, grid-connected devices in user side. The operation of virtual power plants affects the economic benefits and environmental benefits. However, due to the stochastic and fluctuating nature of power generation from renewable energy sources, the optimal scheduling problem for the virtual power plant containing high-dimensional random variables is difficult to solve. The conic power flow constraints are considered in the virtual power plant day-ahead optimal scheduling models to maximize the revenue by virtue of optimizing the flexible resources such as energy storage system and interruptible load. To quantify the uncertainties in the optimization problem, this paper proposes a network state-based power scenario reduction strategy for renewable energy generation, where typical scenarios are selected by the state of the grid voltage. The proposed day-ahead scheduling model is a mixed-integer, nonlinear, large-scale, stochastic optimization problem with high dimensional random variables, which is difficult to be solved directly by traditional centralized method. By temporally decoupling the charging and discharging model of energy storage systems, a distributed optimization algorithm is proposed based on multi-temporal power flow decoupling optimization model. The simulation results show that the proposed distributed optimization algorithm has high accuracy and good convergence, the virtual power plant can achieve day-ahead optimal scheduling and effectively promote renewable energy accommodation under the security and reliability of the grid. © 2024 The Authors},

abstract = {With the commercial deployment of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, the future integrated 6G-satellite system represents an excellent solution for ubiquitous connectivity and high-throughput data service to massive users. Due to the heterogeneity of users' traffic profiles, uneven traffic distribution among beams or users often occurs in LEO satellite systems. Conventional satellite payloads with fixed beam radiation patterns may result in large gaps between requested and allocated capacity. The advances of flexible satellite payloads with dynamic beamforming capabilities enable spot beams to adjust their coverage and adaptively schedule users, thus offering spatial-temporal domain flexibility. Motivated by this, as an early attempt, we investigate how adaptive beam patterns with flexible user scheduling schemes can help alleviate mismatches of requested-transmitted data in uneven-traffic and full-frequency reuse LEO systems. We formulate an optimization problem to jointly determine beam patterns, power allocation, user-LEO association, and user-slot scheduling. The problem is identified as mixed-integer nonconvex programming. We propose an efficient iterative algorithm to solve the problem by first determining beam patterns and user associations at the frame scale, followed by optimizing power allocation and user scheduling at the timeslot scale. The four-decision components are iteratively updated to improve the overall performance. Numerical results demonstrate the benefits brought by adaptive beam patterns and their effectiveness in reducing the mismatch effect in uneven-traffic LEO systems. © 1983-2012 IEEE.},

In this work, we study the impact of jointly locating charging facilities, assigning electric buses to trips, and determining when and where to charge the buses. We propose a mixed integer linear program that co-optimizes planning and operational decisions jointly and an iterated local search heuristic to solve large-scale instances. Herein, we use a concurrent scheduler algorithm to generate an initial feasible solution, which serves as a starting point for our iterated local search algorithm. In the sequential case, we first optimize trip assignments and charging locations. Charging schedules are then determined after fixing the optimal decisions from the first level. The joint model, on the other hand, integrates charge scheduling within the local search procedure. The solution quality of the joint and sequential iterated local search models are compared for multiple real-world bus transit networks. Our results demonstrate that joint models can help further improve operating costs by 14.1% and lower total costs by about 4.1% on average compared with sequential models. In addition, energy consumption costs and contracted power capacity costs have been reduced significantly due to our integrated planning approach. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Integrating emerging shared mobility with traditional fixed-line public transport is a promising solution to the mismatch between supply and demand in urban transportation systems. The advent of modular vehicles (MVs) provides opportunities for more flexible and seamless intermodal transit. The MVs, which have been implemented, are comprised of automated modular units (MUs), and can dynamically change the number of MUs comprising them at different times and stops. However, this innovative intermodal urban transit brings with it a new level of dynamism and uncertainty. In this paper, we study the problem of jointly optimizing the timetable and the vehicle schedule within an intermodal urban transit network utilizing MVs within the context of distributionally robust optimization (DRO), which allows MVs to dynamically (de)couple at each stop and permits flexible circulations of MUs across different transportation modes. We propose a DRO formulation to explore the trade-off between operators and passengers, with the objective of minimizing the worst-case expectation of the weighted sum of passengers’ and operating costs. Furthermore, to address the computational intractability of the proposed DRO model, we design a discrepancy-based ambiguity set to reformulate it into a mixed-integer linear programming model. In order to obtain high-quality solutionss of realistic instances, we develop a customized decomposition-based algorithm. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The computational results of real-world case studies based on the operational data of Beijing Bus Line illustrate that the proposed integrated timetabling and vehicle scheduling method reduces the expected value of passengers’ and operating costs by about 6% in comparison with the practical timetable and fixed-capacity vehicles typically used in the Beijing bus system. © 2024},

EV scheduling has the potential to become a business that utilizes vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology to mitigate system impacts while providing financial incentives to customers. Efficient EV scheduling is a multi-objective optimization problem that simultaneously considers network and customer perspectives for co-optimization. This study introduces a hierarchical EV charging management platform (EVMP) with day-ahead and real-time stages that satisfy customer preferences while ensuring efficient system operation. In this process, in order to solve the computational issues of the optimal power flow (OPF) problem, including integer variables, the computational burden was alleviated by removing integer variables from the OPF problem of the day-ahead stage, and EV dynamics were effectively handled using the rolling-horizon framework in the real-time stage. This study focuses on the relationships between the objective functions at each stage and utilizes the augmented ɛ-constraint method (AUGMECON) to obtain a Pareto front that assists in stakeholder decision making.

abstract = {The transition towards sustainable energy systems necessitates effective management of renewable energy sources alongside conventional grid infrastructure. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to optimizing grid management by integrating Photovoltaic (PV), wind, and grid energies to minimize costs and enhance sustainability. A key focus lies in developing an accurate scheduling algorithm utilizing Mixed Integer Programming (MIP), enabling dynamic allocation of energy resources to meet demand while minimizing reliance on cost-intensive grid energy. An ensemble learning technique, specifically a stacking algorithm, is employed to construct a robust forecasting pipeline for PV and wind energy generation. The forecasting model achieves remarkable accuracy with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of less than 0.1 for short-term (15 min and one day ahead) and long-term (one week and one month ahead) predictions. By combining optimization and forecasting methodologies, this research contributes to advancing grid management systems capable of harnessing renewable energy sources efficiently, thus facilitating cost savings and fostering sustainability in the energy sector. © 2024 by the authors.},

Home health care provides various services for disabled or elderly individuals at their homes. Also, dealing with the current critical situation of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to the limited capacity of hospitals and the feeling of insecurity in crowded places, home health care is more recommended. This paper addresses a Home Health Care Routing and Scheduling Problem (HHCRSP) with two modes of transportations including public and private modes. Also, multi-depot version of the problem is studied to enhance the service delivery in scattered points. In this study, a mathematical model is presented based on a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) whose objective function is minimization of the sum of the travel distance and overtime costs. Furthermore, three meta-heuristic algorithms including Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO), Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), and Simulated Annealing (SA) are presented for solving large-sized problems. Since the performance of meta-heuristic algorithms depends on setting the parameters, the Taguchi method is used to statistically set parameters of the developed algorithms. The computational results have shown that the proposed IWO has worked better than the other two proposed algorithms statistically. © 2024 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Hybrid power plants have recently emerged as reliable and flexible electricity generation stations by combining multiple renewable energy sources, energy storage systems (ESS), and fossil-based output. However, the effective operation of the hybrid power plants to ensure continuous energy dispatch under challenging conditions is a complex task. This paper proposes a dispatch engine (DE) based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for the planning and management of hybrid power plants. To maintain the committed electricity output, the dispatch engine will provide schedules for operation over extended time periods as well as monitor and reschedule the operation in real time. Through precise prediction of the load and the photovoltaic (PV) and wind power outputs, the proposed approach guarantees optimum scheduling. The precise predictions of the load, PV, and wind power levels are achieved by employing a predictor of the Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) type. With such a dispatch engine, the operational costs of the hybrid power plants and the use of diesel generators (DGs) are both minimized. A case study is carried out to assess the feasibility of the proposed dispatch engine. Real-time measurement data pertaining to load and the wind and PV power outputs are obtained from different locations in the Sultanate of Oman. The real-time data are utilized to predict the future levels of power output from PV and from the wind farm over the course of 24 h. The predicted power levels are then used in combination with a PV–Wind–DG–ESS–Grid hybrid plant to evaluate the performance of the proposed dispatch engine. The proposed approach is implemented and simulated using MATLAB. The results of the simulation reveal the proposed FFNN’s powerful forecasting abilities. In addition, the results demonstrate that adopting the proposed DE can minimize the use of DG units and reduce a plant’s running expenses. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract = {Network slicing represents a substantial technological advance in 5G mobile network, greatly expanding the variety and manifoldness of network services to be supported. Additionally, 3GPP 5G New Radio (NR) has introduced novel features such as mixed numerology and mini-slots, which can be harnessed by network slicing to cater to the diverse requirements of 5G services. While however the co-existence of multiple network slices leads to a challenging resource allocation problem, these new features also severely complicate the management of radio resources. As a further point of attention, the virtualization of radio functions may exact a significant toll from the, already limited, computing resources at the network edge. It follows that a cost-efficient resource allocation across all the slices becomes crucial. In this paper, we address the above-mentioned issues by modeling a cost-efficient radio resource management in 5G NR featuring network slicing, named CERS, through a Mixed Integer Quadratically constrained Program (MIQCP). We maximize the profit of all slices simultaneously guaranteeing the target data rate and delay specified in the service level agreements (SLAs) fo the different traffic flows. To reduce the complexity of the MIQCP problem, we decompose it into two sub-problems, namely, the scheduling problem of enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) user equipments (UEs) on a time-slot basis and of Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (uRLLC) UEs on a mini-slot basis, while keeping the objective unchanged. To address the scheduling issue of eMBB UEs, we employ a heuristic technique, and, by leveraging the outcome of this heuristic, we derive an optimal solution for the problem of uRLLC UEs. The significance of the proposed approach over a baseline approach is evaluated through extensive numerical simulations in terms of the number of allocated uRLLC resource blocks (RBs) per mini-slot. We also assess our approach by measuring the impact of the uRLLC slice changes on the eMBB slice, and vice versa, including delay for uRLLC users and data rates for eMBB users. © 2024 The Authors},

abstract = {This paper considers the impact of setup time in production scheduling and proposes energy-aware distributed hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup time (EADHFSP-ST) that simultaneously optimizes the makespan and the energy consumption. We develop a mixed integer linear programming model to describe this problem and present a two-stage adaptive memetic algorithm (TAMA) with a surprisingly popular mechanism. First, a hybrid initialization strategy is designed based on the two optimization objectives to ensure the convergence and diversity of solutions. Second, multiple population co-evolutionary approaches are proposed for global search to escape from traditional cross-randomization and to balance exploration and exploitation. Third, considering that the memetic algorithm (MA) framework is less efficient due to the randomness in the selection of local search operators, TAMA is proposed to balance the local and global searches. The first stage accumulates more experience for updating the surprisingly popular algorithm (SPA) model to guide the second stage operator selection and ensures population convergence. The second stage gets rid of local optimization and designs an elite archive to ensure population diversity. Fourth, five problem-specific operators are designed, and non-critical path deceleration and right-shift strategies are designed for energy efficiency. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, multiple experiments are performed on a benchmark with 45 instances. The experimental results show that the proposed TAMA can solve the problem effectively. © 2021 TUP.},

abstract = {Autoscaling enables container cluster orchestrators to automatically adjust computational resources, such as containers and Virtual Machines (VMs), to handle fluctuating workloads effectively. This adaptation can involve modifying the amount of resources (horizontal scaling) or adjusting their computational capacity (vertical scaling). The motivation for our work stems from the limitations of previous autoscaling approaches, which are either partial (scaling containers or VMs, but not both) or excessively complex to be used in real systems. This complexity arises from their use of models with a large number of variables and the addressing of two simultaneous challenges: achieving the optimal deployment for a single scheduling window and managing the transition between successive scheduling windows. We propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to address the challenge of autoscaling containers and VMs jointly, both horizontally and vertically, to minimize deployment costs. This model is designed to be used with predictive autoscalers and be solved in a reasonable time, even for large clusters. To this end, improvements and reasonable simplifications with respect to previous models have been carried out to drastically reduce the size of the resource allocation problem. Furthermore, the proposed model provides an enhanced representation of system performance in comparison to previous approaches. A tool called Conlloovia has been developed to implement this model. To evaluate its performance, we have conducted a comprehensive assessment, comparing it with two heuristic allocators with different problem sizes. Our findings indicate that Conlloovia consistently demonstrates lower deployment costs in a significant number of cases. Conlloovia has also been evaluated with a real application, using synthetic and real workload traces, as well as different scheduling windows, with deployment costs approximately 20% lower than heuristic allocators. © 2024, The Author(s).},

abstract = {The computing power network (CPN) is a novel network technology that integrates computing power from the cloud, edge, and terminals using IP/optical cross-layer networks for distributed computing. CPNs can provide an effective solution for distributed model training (DMT). As a bandwidth optimization architecture based on data parallelism, ring all-reduce (RAR) is widely used in DMT. However, any node or link failure on the ring can interrupt or block the requests deployed on the ring. Meanwhile, due to the resource competition of batch RAR-based DMT requests, inappropriate scheduling strategies will also lead to low training efficiency or congestion. As far as we know, there is currently no research that considers the survivability of rings in scheduling strategies for RAR-based DMT. To fill this gap, we propose a scheduling scheme for RAR-based DMT requests in CPNs to optimize the allocation of computing and wavelength resources considering the time dimension while ensuring reliability. In practical scenarios, service providers may focus on different performance metrics. We formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) model and a RAR-based DMT deployment algorithm (RDDA) to solve this problem considering four optimization objectives under the premise of the minimum blocking rate: minimum computing resource consumption, minimum wavelength resource consumption, minimum training time, and maximum reliability. Simulation results demonstrate that our model satisfies the reliability requirements while achieving corresponding optimal performance for DMT requests under four optimization objectives. © 2009-2012 Optica Publishing Group.},

abstract = {The variety of available technology options for the operation of zero-emission bus systems gives rise to the problem of finding an optimal technology decision for bus operators. Among others, overnight charging, opportunity charging and hydrogen-based technology options are frequently pursued technological solutions. As their operating conditions are strongly influenced by the urban context, an optimal technology decision is far from trivial. In this paper, we propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based optimization model that is built upon a broad input database, which allows a customized adaption to local circumstances. The ultimate goal is to determine an optimal technology decision for each bus line, considering its combined effects on charging and vehicle scheduling as well as infrastructural design. To this end, we develop technology-specific network representations for five distinct technologies. These networks can be viewed individually or as a multi-layered graph, which represents the input for the optimal technology mix. The proposed optimization framework is applied to a real-world instance with more than 4.000 timetabled trips. To study the sensitivity of solutions, parameter changes are tested in a comprehensive scenario design. The subsequent analysis produces valuable managerial insights for the bus operator and highlights the decisive role of certain planning assumptions. The results of our computations reveal that the deployment of a mixed fleet can indeed lead to financial benefits. The comparison of single technology system solutions provides a further basis for decision making and demonstrates relative superiorities between different technologies. © The Author(s) 2023.},

Optimizing multimission exploration campaigns is challenging due to the large number of required launches as well as their sequencing and compatibility requirements, making conventional space logistics formulations unscalable. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes an alternative approach that leverages a two-level hierarchical optimization algorithm: an evolutionary algorithm is used to explore the campaign scheduling solution space, and each of the solutions is then evaluated using a time-expanded multicommodity flow mixed-integer linear program. A number of case studies, focusing on the Artemis lunar exploration program, demonstrate how the method can be used to analyze potential campaign architectures. The method enables a potential mission planner to study the sensitivity of a campaign to program-level parameters such as logistics vehicle availability and performance, payload launch windows, and in situ resource utilization infrastructure efficiency. © 2024 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

abstract = {Optimization-based scheduling in the chemical industry is highly beneficial but also highly difficult due to its combinatorial complexity. Different modeling and optimization techniques exist, each with individual strengths. We propose Benders decomposition to integrate mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and discrete-event simulation (DES) to solve flow shop scheduling problems with makespan minimization objective. The basic idea is to generate valid Benders cuts based on sensitivity information of the DES sub problem, which can be found in the critical paths of DES solutions. For scaled literature flow shops, our approach requires at least an order of magnitude fewer iterations than a genetic algorithm and provides optimality gap information. For a real-world case study, our approach finds good solutions very quickly, making it a powerful alternative to established methods. We conclude that the Benders-DES algorithm is a promising approach to combine rigorous MILP optimization capabilities with high-fidelity DES modeling capabilities. © 2024 The Author(s)},

abstract = {The dynamic scheduling problem (DSP) in unreliable flexible manufacturing systems (UFMSs) with concurrency, conflicts, resource sharing, and sequential operations is a complex optimization problem that requires the use of efficient solution methodologies. The effectiveness of scheduling UFMSs relies on the quality of equipment maintenance. Currently, UFMSs with consistently large queues of parts awaiting service employ a repair-after-failure approach as a standard maintenance procedure. This method may require unexpected resources, incur costs, consume time, and potentially disrupt the operations of other UFMSs, either partially or fully. This study suggests using a predictive maintenance (PdM) strategy that utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT) to predict and avoid early mechanical equipment failures before they happen in UFMSs, thereby reducing unplanned downtime and enhancing reliability. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to construct timed Petri net (TPN) models using the IoT for the PdM configuration of mechanical equipment in the dynamic scheduling problem of UFMSs. This necessitates that users represent the specific problem using TPNs. The process of PN modeling requires the utilization of domain knowledge pertaining to the target problems as well as to machine information. However, it is important to note that the modeling rules for PNs are straightforward and limited in number. Consequently, the TPN model is applied to generate and formulate mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) instances accurately. This is done to identify the optimal production cycle time, which may be implemented in real-life scenarios. Several UFMS instances are used to demonstrate the applications and effectiveness of the proposed method. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed method shows superior solution quality, effectively solves instances for a total of 10 parts and 6 machines, and achieves a solution in a reasonable CPU time. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract = {To enhance fuel efficiency and lower manufacturing and maintenance costs, in-vehicle wireless networks can facilitate the weight reduction of vehicle wire harnesses. In this paper, we utilize the Impulse Radio-UltraWideband (IR-UWB) of IEEE 802.15.4a/z for in-vehicle wireless networks because of its excellent signal penetration and robustness in multipath environments. Since clear channel assessment is optional in this standard, we employ polling control as a multiple access control to prevent interference within the system. Therein, the preamble overhead is large in IR-UWB of IEEE 802.15.4a/z. Hence, aggregating as much sensor data as possible within each frame is more efficient. In this paper, we assume that reading out data from sensors and sending data to actuators is periodical and that their respective phases can be adjusted. Therefore, this paper proposes an integer linear programming-based scheduling algorithm that minimizes the number of transmitted frames by adjusting the read and write phases. Furthermore, we provide a heuristic algorithm that computes a suboptimal but acceptable solution in a shorter time. Experimental validation shows that the data aggregation of the proposed algorithms is robust against interference. © 2024 The Institute of Electronics.},

abstract = {Future cities must play a vital role in reducing energy consumption and decarbonizing the electricity sector, thus evolving from passive structures towards more efficient smart cities. This transition can be facilitated by energy communities. This emerging paradigm consists of collectivizing a set of residential installations equipped with onsite renewable generators and storage assets (i.e., prosumers), which can eventually share resources to pursue collective welfare. This paper focuses on cooperative communities, where prosumers share resources without seeking selfish monetary counterparts. Despite their apparent advantages, energy management and scheduling of energy communities suppose a challenge for conventional tools due to the high level of uncertainty (especially due to intermittent renewable generation and random demand), and privacy concerns among prosumers. This paper addresses these issues. Specifically, a novel management structure based on multiple aggregators is proposed. This paradigm preserves users' confidential features while allowing them to extract the full potential of their assets. To efficiently manage the variety of assets available under uncertainty, an adaptive robust day-ahead scheduling model is developed, which casts as a solvable and portable Mixed Integer Linear Programming framework, which eases its implementation in real-world cases. The new proposal concerns uncertain generation and demand using a polyhedral representation of the uncertainty set. A case study is conducted to validate the developed model, showing promising results. Moreover, different results are obtained and analysed. Finally, it is worth remarking on how the level of robustness impacts the collective bill, incrementing it by 75 % when risk-averse conditions are assumed. In addition, the role of storage assets under pessimistic conditions is remarked, pointing out that these assets rule the scheduling plan of the community instead of renewable generators. © 2024 The Author(s)},

abstract = {The overall electricity consumption of electrolytic aluminum and ferroalloy loads is significant, and some of these loads have dispatch potential that can be used to locally absorb wind power while reducing dependence on conventional thermal power. To characterize the uncertainty of wind power, a fuzzy set of wind power forecasting error probability distribution based on the Wasserstein distance was first established, and the approximate radius of the fuzzy set was corrected under extreme scenarios. By introducing joint chance constraints, the inequalities of uncertain variables were established at the lowest confidence level to improve the reliability of the model. Next, a two-stage distributed robust optimal scheduling model for source-load coordination was developed. In the first stage, wind power forecasting information was fully utilized to schedule the electrolytic aluminum load and optimize unit commitment. In the second stage, the uncertainty of wind power output was considered to schedule the ferroalloy load and optimize unit output. The model was approximately transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming problem and solved using a sequential algorithm. The IEEE 24-bus system was used for case validation. The validation results show that the model can effectively improve wind power absorption capacity, reduce overall operating costs, and achieve a balance between low carbon emissions and robustness. © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract = {With the shortage of fossil energy and the increasingly serious environmental problems, renewable energy based on wind and solar power generation has been gradually developed. For the problem of wind power uncertainty and the low-carbon economic optimization problem of an integrated energy system with power to gas (P2G) and carbon capture and storage (CCS), this paper proposes an economic optimization scheduling strategy of an integrated energy system considering wind power uncertainty and P2G-CCS technology. Firstly, the mathematical model of the park integrated energy system with P2G-CCS technology is established. Secondly, to address the wind power uncertainty problem, Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is used to generate a large number of wind power scenarios, and the fast antecedent elimination technique is used to reduce the scenarios. Then, to establish a mixed integer linear programming model, the branch and bound algorithm is employed to develop an economic optimal scheduling model with the lowest operating cost of the system as the optimization objective, taking into account the ladder-type carbon trading mechanism, and the sensitivity of the scale parameters of P2G-CCS construction is analyzed. Finally, the scheduling scheme is introduced into a typical industrial park model for simulation. The simulation result shows that the consideration of the wind uncertainty problem can further reduce the system’s operating cost, and the introduction of P2G-CCS can effectively help the park’s integrated energy system to reduce carbon emissions and solve the problem of wind and solar power consumption. Moreover, it can more effectively reduce the system’s operating costs and improve the economic benefits of the park. © 2024 by the authors.},

Time-sensitive network (TSN), as a new generation of deterministic Ethernet communication technology, is the main development direction of time-critical communication technology applied in industrial environments, and Wi-Fi technology has become the main way of wireless access for users due to its advantages of high portability and mobility.

For classified material relocation needs and constraints, we obtain the relationship between walking speed and load weight for a single person, as well as the time cost for different round trips. By establishing an integer programming model with the minimum total transportation time cost and shelf life as the objective function and the requirements of negative weight and speed as the constraint conditions, we reach the optimal item allocation methods considering time cost and shelf life. We discover that there is an approximate linear relationship between the change in natural walking speed and travel time when the load is small, thus obtaining the time cost of student transportation under different round-trip situations. The Monte Carlo simulation algorithm, which is more efficient compared with other methods such as the integer programming method, is used to obtain the optimal allocation scheme that meets the efficiency and quality requirements. The analysis methods and results can be used as guidance for task scheduling optimization for material relocation in educational organizations as well as commercial agencies. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract = {Planning maintenance of medium voltage overhead lines is one of the most important issues in the studies on power distribution network, which will prevent and reduce unwanted interruption. In this paper, long-term maintenance of medium voltage networks was planned by multi-objective function, including an extended mixed-integer linear model to optimize costs, energy not supplied (ENS), and average interruption duration index (SAIDI). In addition, the uncertainty about the annual growth rate of the load, the increase in the cost of goods and services and the increase in the selling price of energy as well as various constraints are all included in the desired objective function, which is one of the main innovations of this paper compared to other published studies. To apply the uncertainties, information gap decision theory (IGDT) has been used, and to solve the objective functions, LP-Metric method has been used. The proposed method was implemented on the standard 11-bus RBTS network by MATLAB and GAMS. The results showed that three different long-term maintenance plans proposed here lead to the optimization of the annual maintenance costs of network, reduction in ENS and interruption, and increase in the reliability of the network based on the uncertainty of each feeder. © 2024 The Authors.

abstract = {Operations Research practitioners often want to model complicated functions that are difficult to encode in their underlying optimisation framework. A common approach is to solve an approximate model, and then use a simulation to evaluate the true objective value of one or more solutions. We propose a new approach to integrating simulation into the optimisation model itself. The idea is to run the simulation at each incumbent solution to a master problem. The simulation results are then used to guide the trajectory of the optimisation model itself using logic-based Benders cuts. We test the approach on a class of stochastic resource allocation problems with monotonic performance measures. We derive strong novel Benders cuts that are provably valid for all problems of the given form. We consider two concrete examples: a nursing home shift scheduling problem, and an airport check in counter allocation problem. While previous papers on these applications could only approximately solve realistic instances, we are able to solve them exactly within a reasonable amount of time. Moreover, while those papers account for the inherent variance of the problem by including estimates of the underlying random variables as model parameters, we are able to compute sample-average approximations to optimality with up to 100 scenarios. © 2023 The Authors},

abstract = {As the Internet of Things(IoT) and its intelligent applications continue to proliferate, forthcoming 6G networks will confront the dual challenge of heightened communication and computing capacity demands. To address this, D2D collaborative computing is being explored. However, the current D2D collaborative computing ignores the integrity of computing and communication. For a single-task device, offloading operations intertwine computing and communication, internal coupling causes due to parallel executed between local and D2D offloading. In addition, external coupling arises among devices competing for limited radio and computing resources. Worse, internal coupling and external coupling interact, exacerbating the situation. To address these challenges, a novel D2D offloading framework is proposed based on hyper-graph matching in this paper. Our goal is to minimize both delay and energy costs while ensuring service quality for all users by jointly optimizing task scheduling, offload policies and resource allocation. The original problem is formulated as a nonlinear integer programming problem. Then, by three-stage strategy optimization decomposition, it is separated into several sub-problems. In the first stage, a polynomial-time algorithm has been developed to optimize the task offloading ratio, taking into account both its upper and lower bounds. In the second stage, a geometric programming algorithm has been created to address power allocation. In the third stage, a three-dimensional hyper-graph matching model is employed to derive the optimal offloading and channel allocation policies. This is based on analyzing the conflict graph and applying the claw theorem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms other algorithms by approximately 12%, 20%, 28%, 40%, respectively. Moreover, it enhances both spectral efficiency and computational efficiency. © 2024 The Author(s)},

abstract = {This article tackles the problem of optimal placement of complex real-time embedded applications on heterogeneous platforms. Applications are composed of directed acyclic graphs of tasks, with each directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) having a minimum inter-arrival period for its activation requests and an end-to-end deadline within which all of the computations need to terminate since each activation. The platforms of interest are heterogeneous power-aware multi-core platforms with Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) capabilities, including big.LITTLE Arm architectures and platforms with GPU or Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware accelerators with Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration capabilities. Tasks can be deployed on CPUs using partitioned Earliest Deadline First (EDF)-based scheduling. Additionally, some of the tasks may have an alternate implementation available for one of the accelerators on the target platform, which are assumed to serve requests in non-preemptive FIFO order. The system can be optimized by minimizing power consumption, respecting precise timing constraints, maximizing the applications’ slack, respecting given power consumption constraints, or even a combination of these, in a multi-objective formulation. We propose an off-line optimization of the mentioned problem based on mixed-integer quadratic constraint programming (MIQCP). The optimization provides the DVFS configuration of all the CPUs (or accelerators) capable of frequency switching and the placement to be followed by each task in the DAGs, including the software-vs.-hardware implementation choice for tasks that can be hardware accelerated. For relatively big problems, we developed heuristic solvers capable of providing suboptimal solutions in a significantly reduced time compared to the MIQCP strategy, thus widening the applicability of the proposed framework. We validate the approach by running a set of randomly generated DAGs on Linux under SCHED_DEADLINE, deployed onto two real boards, one with Arm big.LITTLE architecture, the other with FPGA acceleration, verifying that the experimental runs meet the theoretical expectations in terms of timing and power optimization goals. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract = {The operational phase of integrated energy systems (IESs), installed in distribution systems, is increasingly confronted with uncertainties in electrical consumption and output power of variable energy resource (VRE) (e.g., solar photovoltaics). One common approach to mitigate this challenge is to implement day-Ahead (DA) scheduling based on cleared prices and purchased power. While this method is effective to some extent, it may not always provide the level of accuracy required. Another viable option is the application of incentive-based demand-response program (I-DRP), where adjustments to energy usage are made in return for a fixed tariff. Nonetheless, this method could result in monopolistic decision-making within an expanding energy industry, albeit assisting in alleviating the barrier. The complexity doubles as the nonlinear formulation of economic objective function is considered in the optimization stage. Hence, the optimality of the solution is a matter of concern. To address these challenges, this research introduces a two-stage coordinated strategy (TSCS) that combines accurate short-Term forecasting of uncertainties and I-DRP with regulations of DA and real-Time markets to identify the best possible offers and improves the operational efficiency of the IES. By conducting simulations on the IEEE 85-bus test system and comparing the results of the proposed algorithm with those of stochastic programming with fixed reward and penalty rates, our study demonstrates the reliability and accuracy of TSCS, highlighting the flexibility of offers in terms of customer's participation in the optimal operation of the IES. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Cloud computing is the paradigm for delivering streaming content, office applications, software functions, computing power, storage, and more as services over the Internet. It offers elasticity and scalability to the service consumer and profit to the provider. The success of such a paradigm has resulted in a constant increase in the providers’ infrastructure, most notably data centers. Data centers are energy-intensive installations that require power for the operation of the hardware and networking devices and their cooling. To serve cloud computing needs, the data center organizes work as virtual machines placed on physical servers. The policy chosen for the placement of virtual machines over servers is critical for managing the data center resources, and the variability of workloads needs to be considered. Inefficient placement leads to resource waste, excessive power consumption, and increased communication costs. In the present work, we address the virtual machine placement problem and propose an Imitation-Based Optimization (IBO) method inspired by human imitation for dynamic placement. To understand the implications of the proposed approach, we present a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that, with the proposed IBO, the energy consumption decreases at an average of 7%, 10%, 11%, 28%, 17%, and 35% compared to Hybrid meta-heuristic, Extended particle swarm optimization, particle swarm optimization, Genetic Algorithm, Integer Linear Programming, and Hybrid Best-Fit, respectively. With growing workloads, the proposed approach can achieve monthly cost savings of €201.4 euro and CO2 Savings of 460.92 lbs CO2/month. © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract = {Research has shown the effective use of storage technologies to support the operation of a network with a large share of renewable sources of energy. This is done by storing excess energy when generation exceeds demand and delivering the extra energy stored when demand exceeds generation. This ensures that renewable resources are used even when renewable generation is not sufficient to satisfy the demand. To maximise the benefit of storage units in the network, their size and location within the network need to be optimised to the characteristics of the network, the demand and generation profiles. The optimisation is done to minimise network congestion and losses while maximising the benefits of the storage elements in the network. Several optimisation processes have been employed to perform this task but consideration of the storage technology and storage utilisation were not sufficiently explored. The proposed method considered optimising the size and location of distributed energy storage resources in a radial distribution network taking into consideration the effect of storage technology. The results showed that the location and sizes of distributed energy storage depend not only on the aggregated size of the technology but also on the technology types. The results also show that the size of the aggregated storage influences the overall network losses. Generally, the larger the aggregated size of distributed storage, the more the storage units are distributed resulting in a greater reduction of network losses. Among the storage technologies considered, Lithium-Ion batteries presented the most improvement in network losses due to their higher-rated power delivery and charging capacity relative to the energy storage size. © 2024 The Author(s)},

abstract = {Multi-energy synergy systems integrating high-penetration large-scale plug-in electric vehicles, distributed renewable energy generations, and battery energy storage systems have great potential to reduce the reliance of the grid on traditional fossil fuels. However, the random charging characteristics of plug-in electric vehicles and the uncertainty of photovoltaics may impose an additional burden on the grid and affect the supply–demand equilibrium. To address this issue, judicious scheduling optimization offers an effective solution. In this study, considering charge and discharge management of plug-in electric vehicles and intermittent photovoltaics, a novel Multi-energy synergy systems scheduling framework is developed for solving grid instability and unreliability issues. This formulates a large-scale mixed-integer problem, which calls for a powerful and effective optimizer. The new binary level-based learning optimization algorithm is proposed to address nonlinear large-scale high-coupling unit commitment problems. To investigate the feasibility of the proposed scheme, numerical experiments have been carried out considering multiple scales of unit numbers and various scenarios. Finally, the results confirm that the proposed scheduling framework is reasonable and effective in solving unit commitment problems, can achieve 3.3% cost reduction and demonstrates superior performance in handling large-scale energy optimization problems. The integration of plug-in electric vehicles, distributed renewable energy generations, and battery energy storage systems is verified to reduce the output power of 192.72 MW units during peak periods to improve grid stability. Therefore, optimizing energy utilization and distribution will become an indispensable part of future power systems. © 2024},

However, placing virtual machines (VMs) on computing servers to provision these services can present significant challenges, particularly in terms of meeting the requirements of application service providers. In this paper, we present a framework that addresses the NP-hard dynamic VM placement problem in order to optimize application availability in cloud computing paradigm. The problem is modeled as an integer nonlinear programming (INLP) optimization with multiple objectives and constraints. The framework comprises three major modules that use optimization methods and algorithms to determine the most effective VM placement strategy in cases of application deployment, failure, and scaling. Our primary goals are to minimize power consumption, resource waste, and server failures while also ensuring that application availability requirements are met. We compare our proposed heuristic VM placement solution with three related algorithms from the literature and find that it outperforms them in several key areas. Our solution is able to admit more applications, reduce power consumption, and increase CPU and RAM utilization of the servers. Moreover, we use a deep learning method that has high accuracy and low error loss to predict application task failures, allowing for proactive protection actions to reduce service outage. Overall, our framework provides a comprehensive solution by optimizing dynamic VM placement.

abstract = {Consumers are increasingly seeking products with a higher degree of customization, and this has intensified the search for more flexible production systems. Unexpected phenomena, including those impacting the economy and public health, have shown the need for high reactivity by manufacturers. Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems are one of the means to respond to new market needs. They are designed to be able to quickly change their structure and thus adapt their functionalities and capabilities. A central question with regard to these types of systems is when and how they should be reconfigured. It is, however, a question that needs to be addressed simultaneously alongside the classic resource allocation and scheduling problems, since the problems are interdependent. This paper proposes four models that address the problem sequentially, partially sequentially, and integrally. Our numerical analysis demonstrates the advantage and importance of treating these problems in an integrated manner. In addition, we provide and compare three exact methods for the integrated process planning, layout, and scheduling optimization problems. The exact methods are integer linear programming, constraint programming, and constraint programming with search strategies, which our numerical examples show to be greatly superior to the two others.

abstract = {As transit authorities increasingly adopt electric buses (EBs) to mitigate air quality concerns and greenhouse gas emissions, new challenges arise in bus scheduling and timetabling. Unlike traditional buses, EBs face operational obstacles due to their shorter range and extended charging times. Existing mathematical optimization models for operation planning of traditional buses must be revised to address these unique characteristics of EBs. This study introduces a new approach to integrate timetabling and bus scheduling to enhance the level of service and minimize operational costs, using a case study of a University shuttle bus service in Montreal, Canada. The level of service will be enhanced by reducing students waiting time and improving their in-vehicle comfort through seat availability. The scheduling aspect seeks to reduce the total operational costs, which include travel, electricity consumption, and usage costs of EBs. The proposed algorithm calculates the waiting time and seat availability for different headway values and addresses the scheduling problem using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model with an arc-based approach, solved using the Cplex Optimization Studio software version 12.8. A normalized weighted sum technique is then applied to select the optimal headway, balancing waiting time, seat availability, and operational costs. The effectiveness of our approach was tested through a case study of Concordia University’s shuttle bus service. Comparative analysis of the current and proposed schedules shows that our approach significantly improves service quality by decreasing waiting times and increasing seat availability while optimizing cost-effectiveness compared to the existing timetable of the Concordia shuttle bus. The proposed approach ensures a smooth transition to a fully electric transit system for shuttle bus services. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract = {We tackle a capacitated lot-sizing and scheduling problem (CLSP) with the main objective of minimizing changeover time in the production of metal parts for car seats. Changeovers occur when a machine (or production line) is reconfigured to produce a different product or part, leading to production downtime and loss of efficiency. In this study, we first provide a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of the problem. We test the limits of solving the problem with commercial mathematical programming software. We also propose two approaches to tackle instances found in practice for which the mathematical programming model is not a viable solution method. Both approaches are based on partitioning the entire production of a part into production runs (or work slots). In the first approach, the work slots are assigned to machines and sequenced by a metaheuristic that follows the search principles of the GRASP (greedy randomized adaptive procedure) and VNS (variable neighborhood search) methodologies. In the second approach, we develop a Hexaly Optimizer (formerly known as LocalSolver) model to assign and sequence work slots. The study provides insights into how to minimize changeovers and improve production efficiency in metal parts manufacturing for car seats. The findings of this study have practical implications for the auto-part manufacturing industry, where efficient and cost-effective production is critical to meet the demands of the market. © 2024 The Authors},

abstract = {The allocation of resources and scheduling of tasks, specifically mapping, in multicore systems on-chip (MCSoC), poses significant challenges. Tasks have diverse resource requirements and interact with each other, while network-on-chip (NoC)-based MCSoC consists of heterogeneous cores and communication networks. The heterogeneity of resources in MCSoC, along with the varying computational and communication demands of applications, makes mapping a complex optimization problem. We have mathematically modeled the mapping problem in NoC-based MCSoC using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) with the objective of minimizing the execution time of applications. This model incorporates computation and communication capacity, energy budget constraints of MCSoC, and execution time requirements of applications. We further propose heuristics, including simulated annealing (SA) and genetic algorithm (GA), considering the capacity and budget constraints of MCSoC systems to accelerate applications and provide quick mapping solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance from SA and GA heuristics is very close (within 10%) to the optimal solutions from MILP across various applications for 2D-Mesh NoCs with 16–100 cores. The energy consumption of SA and GA heuristics is also very close to the optimal solutions from MILP, with a few exceptions on small-scale 16-core NoC. Additionally, SA outperforms GA in most cases for all applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

abstract = {The timely transportation of goods to customers is an essential component of economic activities. However, heavy-duty diesel trucks used for goods delivery significantly contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within many large metropolitan areas, including Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. To reduce GHG emissions by facilitating freight electrification, this paper proposes Joint Routing and Charging (JRC) scheduling for electric trucks. The objective of the associated optimization problem is to minimize the cost of transportation, charging, and tardiness. A large number of possible combinations of road segments as well as a large number of combinations of charging decisions and charging durations leads to a combinatorial explosion in the possible decisions electric trucks can make. The resulting mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem is thus extremely challenging because of the combinatorial complexity even in the deterministic case. Therefore, a Surrogate Level-Based Lagrangian Relaxation (SLBLR) method is employed to decompose the overall problem into significantly less complex truck subproblems. In the coordination aspect, each truck subproblem is solved independently of other subproblems based on the values of Lagrangian multipliers. In addition to serving as a means of guiding and coordinating trucks, multipliers can also serve as a basis for transparent and explanatory decision-making by trucks. Testing results demonstrate that even small instances cannot be solved using the off-the-shelf solver CPLEX after several days of solving. The SLBLR method, on the other hand, can obtain near-optimal solutions within a few minutes for small cases, and within 30 min for large ones. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that as battery capacity increases, the total cost decreases significantly; moreover, as the charging power increases, the number of trucks required decreases as well. © 2024 The Author(s)},

At the same time, network slicing in 5G and beyond systems provides easier management of different categories of users and traffic, and a better basis for providing quality of service, especially for demanding use cases such as industrial control. In previous works, we have presented solutions for scheduling industrial control traffic in LIS and massive MIMO systems. We now consider the case of dynamic slicing in the radio access network, where we need to not only meet the stringent latency and reliability requirements of industrial control traffic, but also minimize the radio resources occupied by the network slice serving the control traffic, ensuring resources are available for lower-priority traffic slices. In this paper, we provide mixed-integer programming optimization formulations for radio resource usage minimization for dynamic network slicing. We tested our formulations in numerical experiments with varying traffic profiles and numbers of nodes, up to a maximum of 32 nodes. For all problem instances tested, we were able to calculate an optimal schedule within 1 s, making our approach feasible for use in real deployment scenarios. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has been growing quickly since the 5 G era arrived, which has boosted the quantity of data stream and computational demands. Ultra-dense Edge Computing (UDEC) is a result of the growing popularity of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Ultra-dense Network (UDN), two vital technologies with bright futures. Task offloading is viewed in the UDEC network as a successful strategy to offer mobile users low-latency and flexible computing capabilities. However, the edge cloud's constrained computing capacity and mobile users' dynamically shifting computing requirements present difficulties for the reasonable scheduling of computing requests to the edge cloud. The Power Allocation (PA) problem for mobile users to address this issue. This problem attempts to use quasiconvex technique to minimize energy consumption. Next, the Joint Request Offloading and Resource Scheduling (JRORS) problem is treated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem to minimize request delay and improve welfare. The request offloading problem and the computational resource scheduling challenge are two subproblems of the JRORS problem that can be further broken down, the JRORS issue is therefore viewed as a dual decision-making problem. A Ratio of Power Consumption to Welfare (RCW) problem through mathematical modeling. An improved snake optimizer (SO) is therefore proposed, which was added with oscillation factor to optimize the location of the weight parameter in the location update and the variation of food production. It can enhance the global search capability and local search ability. By conducting simulation experiments, divide the mobile users into nine groups for testing, select energy consumption, welfare, and RCW as the objective functions, respectively, and compare them with other swarm optimization algorithms, such as Differential Evolution (DE), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant-Lion Optimizer (ALO), Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA), and Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO). The improved algorithm achieved minimal energy consumption and optimal welfare in nearly every test case, contributing to the enhanced effectiveness and cost-efficiency of edge systems, thereby achieving the optimization of task offloading and scheduling. © 2024 The Authors},

To ensure the safety of civil aviation, this paper proposes a method to solve the crew scheduling problem considering pilot fatigue. In order to reflect individual differences and fatigue levels of pilots, an improved three-stage alertness calculation model is first proposed based on subjective and objective perspectives to represent pilots’ alertness levels and fatigue working duration quantitatively. Then, for the crew scheduling problem considering pilot fatigue, a mixed integer programming model is constructed to simultaneously achieve the optimization objectives of reducing the overall scheduling cost and crew fatigue working duration. Next, since the actual crew scheduling problem is large-scale, a solution algorithm based on a column generation framework is developed to improve the quality and efficiency of solving the large-scale crew scheduling problem. Furthermore, in the case study, we collected actual data from an airline company to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Finally, through multiple experimental comparisons and analyses, to balance the two optimization objectives mentioned above, it is more reasonable to handle pilot fatigue working duration with soft constraints. Sensitivity analysis reveals the variation rules of the crew cost and fatigue, providing some valuable managerial insights for the crew scheduling problem considering pilot fatigue. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.},

The performed experimentation demonstrates the efficiency of the approach, capable of determining the optimal solution within an acceptable computation time that aligns with hospital requirements.

abstract = {Prioritizing the development of public transport is an effective way to improve the sustainability of the transport system. In recent years, bus passenger flow has been declining in many cities. How to reform the operating mode of the public transportation system is an important issue that needs to be solved. An autonomous modular bus (AMB) is capable of physical coupling and uncoupling to flexibly adjust vehicle capacity as well as provide high-quality service under unbalanced passenger demand conditions. To promote AMB adoption and reduce the operating cost of the bus route, this paper presents a joint optimization method to simultaneously determine the AMB dispatching plan, charging plan, and charging infrastructure configuration scheme. Then, a mixed-integer programming model is formulated to minimize the operating costs of the bus route. A hybrid intelligent algorithm combining enumeration, cloning algorithm, and particle swarm optimization algorithm is designed to resolve the formulated model. Subsequently, an actual bus route is taken as an example to validate the proposed method. Results indicate that the developed method in this paper can reduce the operating costs and operational energy consumption of the route compared with the real route operating plan. Specifically, the reduction ratio of the former is 23.85%, and the reduction ratio of the latter is 5.92%.

abstract = {Steel plate is one of the most valuable steel products which is highly customized in specification according to the demands of users. In this case, the outbound scheduling of steel plates is a challenging issue since its efficiency and complexity are impacted by both steel plate shuffling and truck loading sequencing. To overcome this challenge, we propose to jointly optimize steel plate shuffling and truck loading sequencing (SPS-TLS) by utilizing the data of steel plates and trucks collected by Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The SPS-TLS problem is firstly transformed as an orders scheduling problem which is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. Then an alternating iteration algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (AltDRL) is proposed to solve the SPS-TLS problem. In AltDRL, the deep Q network (DQN) with prioritized experience replay (PER) and the heuristic algorithm are combined to iteratively obtain the near-optimal shuffling position of blocking plates and truck sequence. Experiments are executed based on data collected from a real steel logistics park. The results confirm that AltDRL can significantly reduce the number of plate shuffles and improve the outbound scheduling efficiency of steel plates. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Recent advancements in production scheduling have arisen in response to the need for adaptation in dynamic environments. This paper addresses the challenge of real-time scheduling within the context of sustainable production. We redefine the sustainable distributed permutation flow-shop scheduling problem using an online mixed-integer programming model. The proposed model prioritizes minimizing makespan while simultaneously constraining energy consumption, reducing the number of lost working days and increasing job opportunities within permissible limits. Our approach considers machines operating in different modes, ranging from manual to automatic, and employs two real-time scheduling strategies: predictive-reactive and proactive-reactive scheduling. We evaluate two rescheduling policies: continuous and event-driven. To demonstrate the model's applicability, we present a case study in auto workpiece production. We manage model complexity through various reformulations and heuristics, such as Lagrangian relaxation and Benders decomposition for initial optimization as well as four problem-specific heuristics for real-time considerations. For solving large-scale instances, we employ simulated annealing and tabu search metaheuristic algorithms. Our findings underscore the benefits of the predictive-reactive scheduling strategy and the efficiency of the event-driven rescheduling policy. By addressing dynamic scheduling challenges and integrating sustainability criteria, this study contributes valuable insights into real-time scheduling and sustainable production. © 2024 The Author(s)},

abstract = {To evaluate the potential market revenue increase coming from the installation of a hybrid battery energy storage system (HESS) paired with a wind plant, a model is proposed for optimizing the simultaneous participation of the plant in the day-ahead (DA) and the automatic frequency restoration reserve (aFRR) markets. In the analysis, the Danish market is assumed as a case study. The HESS is composed of a combination of lithium-ion (LiB) and vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB). The optimal dispatching problem is solved as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), using a robust formulation to consider the uncertainty of the aFRR market. The developed economic model incorporates the influence of cyclic degradation on the lithium-ion battery's life, considering it dependent on the number of cycles and the depth-of-discharge of each cycle. The economic and technical effects of hybridization are investigated for different storage sizes. Furthermore, the impact of robust optimization, in contrast to non-robust optimization, is investigated along with the impact of detailed storage models, which consider variable efficiencies and variable charging and discharging rates, in contrast to simple models, which consider constant storage efficiencies. Results show that the hybridization between lithium-ion and vanadium batteries positively influences the life of lithium-ion batteries, increasing its life by up to 47% compared to a case without hybridization. For a 10 MW wind farm, the optimal battery configuration is comprised of a hybrid system made of a 1 MW/1MWh LiB and a VRFB of negligible size, with 2 years of payback time. The simultaneous participation in both the DA and aFRR markets proves to be advantageous with annual revenue increases of 39%–56% compared to the system bidding on the sole DA market, regardless of the storage size. The revenue increase attributed to the battery installation does not ensure the feasibility of investment, due to the high cost of the battery technologies, even if the hybrid configuration proves to be more profitable than the non-hybrid configuration. © 2024 The Author(s)},

abstract = {Matheuristic is an optimisation methodology that integrates mathematical approaches and heuristics to address intractable combinatorial optimisation problems, where a common framework is to insert mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models as local search functions for evolutionary algorithms. However, since a mathematical programming formulation only tries to find the solution with the best objective value, matheuristics are rarely adopted to multi-objective scenarios asking for a set of Pareto optimal solutions, for example, vehicle routing problems and production scheduling problems. In this situation, the ɛ-constraint, which transforms multi-objective problems into single-objective formulations by considering selected objectives as constraints, seems to be a promising approach. First, an augmented ɛ-constraint-based matheuristic methodology (ɛ-MH) is proposed to apply the idea of ɛ-constraint to embedded MILP models, so that Pareto fronts obtained by meta-heuristics can be further improved by solving a set of MILP models. Afterwards, four speed-up strategies are developed to alleviate the computational burden resulting from repeatedly solving mathematical formulations, which also imply preferable scenarios for taking advantages of the ɛ-MH. Finally, several real-world bi-objective scheduling problems are discussed to present potential applications for the proposed methodology. © 2024 The Author(s).
