	abstract = {We study a problem of scheduling transmissions of status messages over a fading link. The fading process is i.i.d., and is known at the sender after one-slot delay. Messages arrive according to an i.i.d. Bernoulli process at the sender, and each message has a delay deadline of d time-slots. The problem is to decide whether or not to transmit, and to choose an optimum transmit-energy, such that the average Age of Information is minimum satisfying a constraint on transmit-energy and throughput. We pose this problem as a constrained Markov decision process, and provide an Age OPTimum policy (AOPT). We also propose a simple heuristic, Greedy Randomization of Energy Policy (GREP), and compare the performance of AOPT and GREP with ARQ policies. This is one of the first work in finding a minimum age scheduling policy with throughput guarantees and with delayed CSIT for an average transmit-energy constraint.  © 2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To meet the production demand of workshop, this paper proposes an efficient discrete artificial bee colony (DABC) algorithm to solve a new automatic guided vehicle (AGV) scheduling problem with delivery and pickup in a matrix manufacturing workshop. The goal is to produce a AGV transportation solution that minimizes the total cost, including travel cost, time cost, and AGV cost. Therefore, a mixed integer linear programming model is established. To improve the transportation efficiency, a dynamic calculation method is developed. In the DABC algorithm, a heuristic algorithm and a median based probability selection method are used. For improving the quality of the solutions, four effective neighborhood operators are introduced. In the local search, a rule is given to save the operation time and a problem-based search operator is proposed to improve the quality of the best individual. Finally, a series of comparison experiments were implemented with the iterative greedy algorithm, artificial bee colony algorithm, hybrid fruit fly optimization algorithm, discrete artificial bee colony algorithm, improved harmony search, and hybrid genetic-sweep algorithm. The results show that the proposed DABC algorithm has high performance on solving the delivery and pickup problem. © The Author(s) 2023.},

Focusing on three key areas—regional coverage, collaborative exploration, and agent obstacle avoidance—we aim to establish a multi-unmanned ship coverage detection system. For regional coverage, a multi-objective optimization model considering effective area coverage and time efficiency is proposed, utilizing a heuristic simulated annealing algorithm for optimal allocation and path planning, achieving a 99.67% effective coverage rate in simulations. Collaborative exploration is tackled through a comprehensive optimization model, solved using an improved greedy strategy, resulting in a 100% static target detection and correct detection index. Agent obstacle avoidance is enhanced by a collision avoidance model and a distributed underlying collision avoidance algorithm, ensuring autonomous obstacle avoidance without communication or scheduling. Simulations confirm zero collaborative failures.

	abstract = {On-demand food delivery (OFD) service is a representative scenario of last-mile logistics. It has gained a fast-growing market but also encounters many challenges, e.g., high dynamism, large-scale complexity, and immediacy requirement. To solve the OFD problem, a predictive-reactive optimization framework with feedback-based knowledge distillation is presented by organically combining deep learning technology and operational research method. In the prediction phase, a deep learning model is designed to predict future information which can reflect the delivery efficiency of dispatching results. To improve model performance, a feedback-based knowledge distillation is proposed which balances the diversity and effectiveness of the ensembled models by adaptively controlling learning weights. In the optimization phase, to avoid myopic decisions and obtain high-quality solutions for long-term objectives, a greedy heuristic with a multi-stage decision-making strategy is designed by employing the predicted future information to assist in making decisions. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world datasets to test the performance of the proposed model and heuristic. Besides, the simulation results illustrate the superiority of the proposed framework for solving the OFD problem in both delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In many military scenarios, an aircraft fleet is oftentimes required to execute a sequence of missions with finite breaks between two adjacent missions. The performance of a fleet can be significantly improved by conducting appropriate maintenance activities on damaged aircraft during each break. The maintenance scheduling of such a scenario is, however, inherently subject to the limitation of maintenance capacities, such as repairpersons and repair facilities. Each maintenance activity contains multiple maintenance jobs that must be sequentially carried out, whereas the structural dependence of the constituent parts of each aircraft produces additional constraints to the sequence of maintenance activities. In this article, a new maintenance scheduling framework for a fleet of military aircraft is formulated to maximize the expected fleet readiness. Each maintenance activity requires specific repair facilities and repairpersons, and the limited maintenance capacities have to be arranged in a holistic manner. Due to the unexpected arrival of the next mission on battlefields, the uncertainty associated with the time duration of a break is also considered. Two heuristic algorithms are put forth to resolve the resulting optimization problem efficiently. Comparative studies show that the proposed heuristics outperform other alternative algorithms and are promising to solve large-scale problems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Chemical manufacturers produce a range of polymer product families on a large scale within complex and dispersed manufacturing plants. These plants are connected through pipelines and are highly dependent on each other. Such a group of connected plants is referred to as a value chain. The process involves the continuous flow of raw materials known as feedstock, from one plant to another, enabling the continuous production of polymers. When the flow of feedstock through the value chain is interrupted due to unexpected events or planned maintenance at a plant, it results in irreversible losses. Consequently, prompt decision support is required to manage these disruptions and ensure the continuity of the flow. This paper evaluates several metaheuristics for effectively scheduling the flow between the plants within the value chain of a chemical manufacturer. These metaheuristics aim to provide near-optimal solutions after disrupting events occur and for the scheduling of periodic production. Sixteen diverse algorithms were considered – including greedy search, tabu search, simulated annealing, and the genetic algorithm – for the profitability of new schedules in the shortest computational time after flow interruption. Moreover, subject-matter experts tested and evaluated several scenario disturbances in the value chain process. The genetic algorithm and variations like local search, tabu search, and greedy search produced the best results. The contribution of this study includes evidence to show that inter-plant scheduling in a multi-product polymer production chain can be done within a reasonable time to ensure continuous process flow. In addition, a novel encoding scheme of decision variables is presented, allowing for scheduling over short or longer time horizons. Finally, the study shows that the performance results of the metaheuristics can guide practitioners on which to select for future implementation; this study showed that the genetic algorithm with population sizes of 50 to 120 and more than 100 generations proved to be best, while results can be obtained in less than 10 minutes. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The present work deals with the multi-product straight pipeline scheduling problem. The considered straight pipeline system is used to transport refined petroleum products from a single source (refinery with storage tanks) to a single destination (distribution center). The main objective is to find a sequence of batches which aims to maximize the total volume to be transported via the pipeline, while meeting the daily customer demands over a fixed time horizon. Each batch contains only one product with a volume between its upper and lower bounds. Constraints related to inventory levels, batch settling periods and forbidden sequences between pairs of products must be respected, and pipeline stoppage periods should also be handled. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP)-like algorithm are proposed to tackle the problem under study. The MILP model is based on the discharging time axis with continuous representation for both time and volume formulation. The GRASP-like algorithm is composed of a construction method and an improvement procedure. The construction method generates a new sequence of batches in a random way with the use of a repair process to obtain an initial solution that satisfies all demands. Then, the improvement procedure is attempted to increase the fill rate of pipeline using volume optimization operators without change the sequence of products. A set of instances was generated from a real case study in order to validate the proposed approach. The performance of our approach is benchmarked against the MILP model (solved using Gurobi Solver), and the numerical experiments proved that the proposed approach obtains very competitive results both in term of solution quality and CPU time. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Robotic Mobile Fulfillment Systems (RMFS) are extensively employed in modern warehouses. In the era of booming e-commerce, this parts-to-picker model significantly reduces warehouse costs and enhances operational efficiency. The primary focus of this article is on the scheduling of batch orders, which involves the simultaneous allocation of mobile robots and picking stations to orders to meet their requirements, with the aim of minimizing processing costs. While the optimization of RMFS has been extensively investigated by scholars in recent years., research on categorized storage remains limited. Furthermore, combinatorial optimization in scenarios with large orders, numerous picking stations, and multiple mobile robots presents an ongoing and significant challenge. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning Method for Batch Order Scheduling (EDRL-OBOS), designed to minimize operational costs in RMFS. Our proposed algorithm, EDRL-OBOS, features a uniquely designed state space that encompasses the allocation of all orders, with the variable portion of the state space diminishing as the algorithm evolves. Moreover, we substitute traditional actions with heuristic rules, significantly enhancing the efficiency of the algorithm. Additionally, we establish a reward function based on a greedy algorithm, ensuring that our method surpasses conventional algorithms. As the number of episodes progresses, the EDRL-OBOS algorithm assigns picking stations and sequences of mobile robots to each order until all orders within the state space are fulfilled, subsequently determining the reward. Subsequently, all states are reset to their initial conditions, and the order allocation scheme is optimized through the learning experience from the previous episode, until convergence is reached. Ultimately, we conduct simulation experiments by varying the number of orders, picking stations, and mobile robots. The results indicate that the EDRL-OBOS algorithm achieves a maximum cost reduction of 22.89%, a minimum of 19.66%, and an average of 21.57%, across various scenarios. At the same time, the computation of our algorithms is superior to that of traditional algorithms. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

In the bi-level scheduling problem, the upper-level problem is that the R&D project leader makes the decision on allocating all R&D project modules to limited R&D researchers and the objective is to minimise the total penalty cost of all projects, and the lower-level problem is that the researchers schedule and sort the assigned tasks to minimise their minimum makespan. The different capacity of researchers is considered, and some structural properties are derived based on the capacity analytics. To tackle this complex scheduling problem, an effective Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm based on the ‘less is more' concept is proposed, where a Multi-Greedy Heuristic is incorporated. Interestingly, we observe that simpler algorithmic strategies may lead to better algorithmic performance. Computational experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the performance of the proposed algorithm is efficient and stable. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Fog computing has emerged as a prospective paradigm to address the computational requirements of IoT applications, extending the capabilities of cloud computing to the network edge. Task scheduling is pivotal in enhancing energy efficiency, optimizing resource utilization and ensuring the timely execution of tasks within fog computing environments. This article presents a comprehensive review of the advancements in task scheduling methodologies for fog computing systems, covering priority-based, greedy heuristics, metaheuristics, learning-based, hybrid heuristics, and nature-inspired heuristic approaches. Through a systematic analysis of relevant literature, we highlight the strengths and limitations of each approach and identify key challenges facing fog computing task scheduling, including dynamic environments, heterogeneity, scalability, resource constraints, security concerns, and algorithm transparency. Furthermore, we propose future research directions to address these challenges, including the integration of machine learning techniques for real-time adaptation, leveraging federated learning for collaborative scheduling, developing resource-aware and energy-efficient algorithms, incorporating security-aware techniques, and advancing explainable AI methodologies. By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, we aim to facilitate the development of more robust, adaptable, and efficient task-scheduling solutions for fog computing environments, ultimately fostering trust, security, and sustainability in fog computing systems and facilitating their widespread adoption across diverse applications and domains.

An example is represented by the logistics sector, where UAVs have been proven to be able to improve the efficiency of the process itself, as their cooperation with trucks can decrease the delivery time and reduce fuel consumption. In this paper, we first state a mathematical formulation of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) applied to logistic routing, where a truck cooperates synchronously with multiple UAVs for parcel delivery. Then, we propose, implement, and compare different sub-optimal routing approaches to the formulated mFSTSP (multiple Flying Sidekick Travelling Salesman Problem) since the inherent combinatorial computational complexity of the problem makes it unattractable for commercial Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers. A local search algorithm, two hybrid genetic algorithms that permutate feasible and infeasible solutions, and an alternative ad-hoc greedy method are evaluated in terms of the total delivery time of the output schedule. For the sake of the evaluation, the savings in terms of delivery time over the well-documented truck-only TSP solution are investigated for each proposed routing solution, and this is repeated for two different scenarios. Monte Carlo simulations corroborate the results. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {—With Industry Internet being more advanced and sophisticated, different closed network domains tend to collaborate on the same task and provide strict Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. However, current Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and Deterministic Networking (DetNet) technologies make it hard to meet the needs of multi-domain collaboration with bounded low service latency. To deal with this dilemma, a time-sensitive flow scheduling scheme across multiple network domains is necessary. In this paper, we propose a deterministic cross-domain flow scheduling (DCDFS) solution to overcome the barriers of inter-domain microbursts not considered by TSN and DetNet. First, a novel hierarchical architecture is designed to support cross-domain coordination, deterministic cycle mapping, and flexible queue stitching functions for DCDFS. Second, we build the system model and formulate the cross-domain flow scheduling problem under a general linear programming (LP) model with core constraints. Third, an effective heuristic algorithm named DCDFS-greedy strategy (DCDFS-GS) is proposed to solve this scheduling problem and reduce the search complexity in multi-domain networks. Finally, simulations in realistic network environments show that DCDFS outperforms the state-of-the-art deterministic schemes for cross-domain scheduling, and optimization algorithms can further improve schedulability and resource utilization. © 2024 IEEE.

	abstract = {The development of wireless energy transmission technology has significantly propelled the advancement of wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs). Energy constraint is one of the most critical challenges in application of WRSNs. Integrating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with wireless energy transmission technology has emerged as a promising approach to overcome the energy constraint problem in WRSNs, leveraging the advantages of UAV, such as flexibility and maneuverability. In this article, we consider the system of WRSN assisted by UAV and mobile utility vehicle (MUV), where the UAV serves as a mobile charger for replenishing energy of sensors and the MUV serves as a mobile base station for replacing the battery of UAV with insufficient energy. In the system, we focus on minimizing the death time of sensors and optimizing the energy consumption of UAV. To address this problem, a multiobjective deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm is employed, where the UAV makes online charging scheduling decisions based on real-time network status and utilizes experience replay for optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the sensors' death time and effectively decreases the energy consumption of UAV. Specially, the performance of proposed algorithm outperforms the three other classical algorithms: 1) genetic algorithm; 2) greedy algorithm; and 3) Q-learning algorithm.  © 2014 IEEE.},

The data, constraints and objective of the SimUSanté problem, which is close to the academic Curriculum-Based Courses Timetabling (CB-CTT) Problem, are detailed. To guide ants towards promising areas of the search space, SimU-AS and SimU-TACS rely on several heuristics that aim to reduce the makespan of each session. Moreover, SimU-TACS combines features like the ϵ-greedy strategy, the tabu memory system and restarts to improve the search. SimU-AS and SimU-TACS were compared to SimU-VNS, a Variable Neighborhood Search, to SimU-MMAS, a hybridized Max-Min Ant System, and to optimal solutions when achievable.

	abstract = {Combining Deep Reinforcement Learning and meta-heuristic techniques represents a new research direction for enhancing the search capabilities of meta-heuristic methods in the context of production scheduling. Q-learning is a prominent reinforcement learning in which its utilization aims to direct the selection of actions, thus preventing the necessity for a random exploration in the iterative process of the metaheuristics. In this study, we provide Q-learning guided algorithms for the Bi-Criteria No-Wait Flowshop Scheduling Problem (NWFSP). The problem is treated as a bi-criteria combinatorial optimization problem where total flow time and makespan are optimized simultaneously. Firstly, a deterministic mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is provided. Then, Q-learning guided algorithms are developed: Bi-Criteria Iterated Greedy Algorithm with Q-Learning (BC-IGQL). Bi-Criteria Block Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Q-Learning (BC-BIHQL). Moreover, the performance of the proposed Q-learning guided algorithms is compared over a collection of Bi-Criteria Genetic Local Search Algorithms (BC-GLS), Bi-Criteria Iterated Greedy Algorithm (BC-IG), Bi-Criteria Iterated Greedy Algorithm with a Local Search (BC-IGALL) and Bi-Criteria Variable Block Insertion Heuristic Algorithm (BC-VBIH). The complete computational experiment, performed on 480 problem instances of Vallada et al. (2015), which is known as the VRF benchmark set, indicates that the BC-BIHQL and the BC-IGQL algorithms outperform the BC-GLS, BC-IG, BC-IGALL, and BC-VBIH algorithms in comparative performance metrics. More specifically, the proposed BC-BIHQL and BC-IGQL algorithms can yield more non-dominated bi-criteria solutions with the most substantial competitiveness than the remaining algorithms. At the same time, both are competitive with each other on the benchmark problems. Moreover, the BC-IGQL algorithm dominates almost 97% and 99% of the solutions reached by the BC-IG, BC-IGALL, and BC-VBIH algorithms in small and large datasets. Similarly, The BC-BIHQL algorithm dominates almost 98% and 99% of the solutions reached by the BC-IG, BC-IGALL, and BC-VBIH algorithms in small and large datasets, respectively. This means that, among all the features that have been compared, the Q-learning-guided algorithms demonstrate the highest level of competitiveness. The outcomes of this study encourage us to discover many more bi-criteria NWFSPs to reveal the trade-off between other conflicting objectives, such as makespan & the number of early jobs, to overcome various industries' problems. © 2024},

	abstract = {User scheduling and beamforming design are two crucial yet coupled topics for multiuser wireless communication systems. They are usually addressed separately with conventional optimization methods. In this paper, cross-layer optimization problem is considered, namely, the user scheduling and beamforming are jointly discussed, subjecting to the requirement of per-user quality of service and the maximum allowable transmit power for multicell multiuser joint transmission networks. To achieve the goal, a mixed discrete-continuous variables combinational optimization problem is investigated with aiming at maximizing the sum rate of the communication system. To circumvent the original non-convex problem with dynamic solution space, we first transform it into a 0-1 integer and continuous variables optimization problem, and then obtain a tractable form with continuous variables by exploiting the characteristics of the 0-1 integer constraints. Finally, the scheduled users and the optimized beamforming vectors are simultaneously calculated by an alternating optimization algorithm. We also theoretically prove that the base stations allocate zero power to the unscheduled users. Furthermore, two heuristic optimization algorithms are proposed respectively based on brute-force search and greedy search. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, and the optimization approach gets relatively balanced results compared with the other two approaches. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A basic combinatorial optimization problem, the Set Covering Problem (SCP) finds extensive use in computer science, operations research, and logistics, among other domains. The SCP’s goal is to determine the smallest number of subsets, or sets, needed to cover every element precisely once given a finite set of items and a collection of subsets of these elements. Numerous practical uses for the SCP exist, such as crew scheduling, truck routing, and facility locating. This paper focuses on obtaining feasible solutions, applying to the obtained solutions constructive heuristics (CH), followed by a redundancy elimination procedure to remove unnecessary sets. To further optimize the quality of the solution, a local search method is also implemented based on the First and Best improvement algorithms. Additionally, the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) and Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) metaheuristics are designed and implemented. Each implemented heuristic underwent testing across 42 instances, with the average deviation from the optimal solution calculated for each instance. The GRASP heuristic demonstrated the most favorable performance, achieving a maximum deviation of 2.26% from the optimal solution, while the VNS approach yielded a maximum deviation of 11.46% from the optimal solution at its best. © 2024, Universidade do Porto - Faculdade de Engenharia.

	abstract = {Demand for imaging of large area targets by space-based assets such as constellations of Earth Observation Satellites (EOS) is on the rise for different applications. The area targets coverage cannot be achieved by a single satellite in a single observation opportunity, as the region for imaging spreads wider than the coverage swaths of imaging sensors. Hence, the imaging satellites are scheduled in a cooperative way to achieve maximum coverage of the area in a given planning time horizon. The scheduling algorithms also aim to maximize or minimize some specific objectives of interest while simultaneously complying with all resource constraints for an efficient use of precious space resources. As the current generation satellites are highly agile, there are many ways of choosing an imaging location in the target area for each single observation opportunity of a satellite. Even though the possible imaging region in continuous space is discretized into a finite number of strips for each observation, the huge combinatorial search space formed with all satellites’ imaging opportunities makes the problem intractable. Thus, the area target imaging scheduling is a complex combinatorial NP-hard optimization problem. Many exact and heuristic methods were evolved to provide a solution to this scheduling problem. Even though the exact methods solve the problem to optimality, they are limited to smaller problem instances because of the high computational complexities involved in those methods. More focus is seen in the literature on heuristic approaches as they guarantee scheduling performance with feasible solutions within an acceptable computational complexity. This paper presents our efficient heuristic approach proposed for the scheduling problem for imaging a large area target using a constellation of multiple satellites. Our approach is an extension of a widely used greedy approach in combination with insights from dynamic programming. In this paper, first we addressed the scheduling problem by describing it in detail and formulating it into a non-linear integer programming problem, considering the multi-objectives of achieving maximum coverage and minimum imaging resolution. The solution to the problem comprises two phases, namely the area decomposition phase and the scheduling phase. In the area decomposition phase, the area target is divided into strips dynamically for each observation opportunity of a satellite. Then exact observation period of each strip is computed using a simplified semi-analytical computational method. In the scheduling phase, we applied our heuristic search strategy, namely Forward and Backward Heuristic Search (FBHS) to obtain a near optimal solution within an acceptable computational time. Through the extensive simulations conducted under various scenarios, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified in comparison with the baseline greedy approach. © 2024 IAA},

	abstract = {Efficient scheduling of transmissions is a key problem in wireless networks. The main challenge stems from the fact that optimal link scheduling involves solving a maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem, which is known to be NP-hard. In practical schedulers, centralized and distributed greedy heuristics are commonly used to approximately solve the MWIS problem. However, most of these greedy heuristics ignore important topological information of the wireless network. To overcome this limitation, we propose fast heuristics based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) that can be implemented in centralized and distributed manners. Our centralized heuristic is based on tree search guided by a GCN and 1-step rollout. In our distributed MWIS solver, a GCN generates topology-aware node embeddings that are combined with per-link utilities before invoking a distributed greedy solver. Moreover, a novel reinforcement learning scheme is developed to train the GCN in a non-differentiable pipeline. Test results on medium-sized wireless networks show that our centralized heuristic can reach a near-optimal solution quickly, and our distributed heuristic based on a shallow GCN can reduce by nearly half the suboptimality gap of the distributed greedy solver with minimal increase in complexity. The proposed schedulers also exhibit good generalizability across graph and weight distributions. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

The greedy-neighbourhood-swapping mechanisms were used to identify medical staff members with the highest soft-constraint (e.g. nurses’ preferences) violation weights on a given day who then swapped their shifts with others. To validate the proposed VNS approaches, we also conducted a case study. Based on the testing instances, all of the proposed VNS approaches generated optimal or near-optimal solutions, and the differences between them were small. The optimal number of the neighbourhood structures was determined to be two, confirming that a larger number of neighbourhoods in a neighbourhood structure would not necessarily be associated with more easily escaping local optima. Furthermore, the resulting outcomes supported the conclusion that the proposed modified VNS approaches generated better schedules for the medical staff members of hospitals than the compared meta-heuristic algorithms. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {As a new production pattern, the hybrid seru system (HSS) originated from the actual production scenario. In the HSS, the implementation of the worker transfer strategy can further enhance the system's flexibility but is rarely studied at present. In this paper, we develop a reinforcement learning driven two-stage evolutionary algorithm (RL-TEA) to address the hybrid seru system scheduling problem with worker transfer (HSSSP-WT). To conquer this complex problem, the HSSSP-WT is divided into worker assignment-related subproblems (WS) and batch scheduling-related subproblems (BS) according to the problem characteristics. To effectively solve the subproblems, a probability model-based exploration and a lower bound-guided heuristic are presented for the WS, and a greedy search is designed for the BS. Meanwhile, to improve search efficiency and effectiveness, a knowledge-based selection mechanism is proposed to determine which subproblem group to optimise in each generation by fusing a reinforcement learning technique and a lower bound filtering strategy. Moreover, an elite enhancement strategy inspired by the problem property is designed to improve the solution quality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the worker transfer strategy and the superior performance of the RL-TEA compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms in solving the HSSSP-WT. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {To protect primary users (PUs) from harmful interference and to maintain seamless communication, secondary users (SUs) need to trigger channel switching in cognitive radio networks (CRNs). However, due to frequent channel switching, SUs lose considerable energy. In order to perform channel switching efficiently in multi-channel CRNs (MC-CRNs), an optimal channel switching schedule is desirable, which can assist SUs in minimizing the number of switching and the switching energy overhead. In this work, we propose a machine learning based prediction-driven channel-switching scheduling scheme for MC-CRNs. The proposed scheme optimizes the utility of SUs by balancing the trade-off between spectral efficiency and channel switching overhead. Initially, a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network-based channel prediction scheme is presented using which individual SUs locally predict PU occupancy in future time slots based on their spectrum sensing history. Thereafter, a cooperative channel prediction framework is introduced using which SUs perform cooperation of local prediction results to enhance the prediction results. Using the cooperative prediction results, a channel-switching scheduling problem is formulated, which captures the trade-off between spectral efficiency and channel-switching overhead. A proof is carried out to establish that the formulated scheduling problem is NP-Hard. To solve the formulated problem in polynomial time, a greedy-based heuristic solution is proposed for scheduling the SUs into different slots of channels to achieve a sub-optimal solution. A simulation-based analysis has been carried out to demonstrate our proposed scheme's efficacy compared to a conventional exhaustive search and fixed channel switching schemes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

The hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (HFSP) is common in manufacturing. Considering the difference of machines at the same stage, the multi-objective distributed hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with unrelated parallel machines (MODHFSP-UPM) is studied with minimum makespan and total tardiness. An improved multi-population genetic algorithm (IMPGA) is proposed for MODHFSP-UPM. The neighbourhood structure is essential for meta-heuristic-based solving algorithms. The greedy job insertion inter-factory neighbourhoods and corresponding move evaluation method are designed to ensure the efficiency of local search. To enhance the optimisation ability and stability of IMPGA, sub-regional coevolution among multiple populations and re-initialisation procedure based on probability sampling are designed, respectively. In computational experiments, 120 instances (including the same proportion of medium and large-scale problems) are randomly generated. The IMPGA performs best in all indicators (spread, generational distance, and inverted generational distance), significantly outperforming existing efficient algorithms for MODHFSP-UPM. Finally, the proposed method effectively solves a polyester film manufacturing case, reducing the makespan and total tardiness by 40% and 60%, respectively. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Planning combined home health and social services has been shown to be a very difficult task for current decision-makers, not only due to the high number of working regulations and user-related necessities that need to be considered but also due to the need for synchronizing both types of services. Moreover, it is highly desirable that users are visited by the fewest number of different caregivers in the same kind of appointments (continuity of service). The complex and multi-objective nature of the synchronized home health and social care routing and scheduling problem has called for the development of automated planning systems that are able to obtain efficient solutions in reasonable computational times. In this work, we propose two heuristic methods to optimize routing and scheduling decisions for this problem with an extensive set of constraints and objectives.

We propose three algorithms based on combinatorial optimization methods: the well-known linear relaxation technique of rounding a solution generated by linear programming (LP), a more sophisticated Lagrangian Relaxation method (LR), as well as a greedy heuristic (GR) for baseline comparison. Our evaluation shows that a schedule built using GR consumes, on average, 22% more processing and communication resources than a more elaborate schedule constructed via the LR method, when scheduling a query for 64 machines. The schedule provided by LR is also, on average, an order of magnitude closer to the optimal schedule for a query compared to GR. We show that scheduling Gigabyte-size multiway queries before execution can reduce its processing time by an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art frameworks for spatial data processing that do not have this capability, and can significantly reduce the amount of shuffled data in the network. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Virtualized Fog-Cloud Computing (VFCC) has emerged as a promising computing model in both research and industry. Its inherent characteristics, such as real-time service provisioning, resource heterogeneity, flexibility, and scalable computational resources, present new opportunities and challenges in the scheduling of computational workflows. Efficient workflow scheduling is crucial in optimizing resource utilization and improving service delivery in VFCC environments. In this paper, we first present a bi-objective optimization model for the workflow scheduling problem in VFCC systems with the aim of minimizing both the system's makespan and energy consumption. We then propose an efficient list-based method to solve the model. The proposed method consists of two distinct phases. In the first phase, we employ the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) to determine task priorities, establishing the task execution sequence. To ensure both convergence speed and diversity, we implement an intelligent semi-greedy approach when generating the initial population. In the second phase, we introduce an energy and makespan-aware heuristic algorithm to efficiently allocate virtual machines to the prioritized tasks. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments using both synthetic and real datasets, including the Epigenomics, Montage, and LIGO graphs. We compare the proposed method with the Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT) and Green-HEFT algorithms in terms of makespan and energy consumption, respectively. Furthermore, we evaluate our proposed method by comparing it to two other algorithms, Multi-objective HEFT (MOHEFT) and Multi-objective ACO (MOACO), using various quality indicators such as generation distance (GD), inverse generation distance (IGD), goal programming approach (GPA), and Hyper volume (HV). The simulation results demonstrate that our method effectively reduces the makespan by 6.38% to 51.19% and energy consumption by 3.52% to 16.49%.

	abstract = {The motivation of task scheduling in heterogeneous computing systems is the optimal management of heterogeneous distributed resources as well as the exploitation of system capabilities. Energy consumption is one of the most important issues in dealing with task scheduling in heterogeneous distributed systems. In addition to energy, the task completion time and the task cost have also been added to the concerns of the users. Since the nature of computing systems is heterogeneous and dynamic, task scheduling with traditional methods is inefficient. Meta-heuristic approaches for task scheduling in heterogeneous distributed systems are open problems that have attracted the attention of researchers. So far, many meta-heuristic approaches have addressed the task scheduling problem. However, most of these algorithms are developed for homogeneous systems and optimize only one of the quality-of-service parameters. With this motivation, this paper presents an optimization for energy-aware design of task scheduling in heterogeneous distributed systems using meta-heuristic approaches. We simultaneously consider several parameters such as energy, task completion time and task execution cost for task scheduling. The Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO) algorithm is considered for the optimization task due to its adaptability to large search spaces. We combine HHO with a greedy algorithm to avoid local optima and early convergence. The evaluation of the proposed method has been done through numerical simulations. Experimental results show promising performance of the proposed method in terms of energy consumption. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {In the context of heterogeneous computer systems, the utilization of task scheduling algorithms is crucial for enhancing system performance. A major challenge in the development of efficient scheduling algorithms for such systems lies in reducing execution time. However, achieving this objective is not a straightforward process. Due to the complexity of these problems, exact algorithms are not feasible for solving them, primarily because of the vast search space involved. Consequently, approximate algorithms become necessary. Among these, meta-heuristic algorithms are notable for their ability to explore large search spaces and generate suitable solutions. Nevertheless, these algorithms are not flawless as they may become trapped in local optima and failing to scan the entire sample space. To address task scheduling problems in heterogeneous computer systems, this research proposes the Intelligent Harris Hawk Optimization algorithm. The algorithm was employed to tackle the task scheduling problem in heterogeneous systems, while also considering common issues associated with such algorithms, including early convergence and limited exploration capability during the exploration phase. To overcome these challenges, the exploration phase was separated from the exploitation phase. This approach aimed to ensure that the algorithm explores the entire problem space without necessarily achieving optimality. However, if the algorithm becomes trapped in a local optimum during the exploitation phase, it may not be able to escape and achieve early convergence. To address this issue, a solution called Bigmax to Fitmax was proposed for escaping local optima in the soft besiege phase, while a unique technique called Crisscross Mutation was introduced for the hard besiege phase. In the final stage, the proposed algorithm will be compared with several other algorithms, including HHO (Harris Hawk Optimization), MOSCOA (A multi-objectives scheduling algorithm based on cuckoo optimization), HACG-TS (Hybrid approach based on cuckoo optimization algorithm and genetic algorithm), GA (Genetic Algorithm), HEFT (Heterogeneous Earliest-Finish-Time), and CPOP (Critical-Path-on-a-Processor), to solve the scheduling problem in a heterogeneous environment. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {A dynamic virtual machine scheduling is the discrete optimization problem that schedules virtual machines over the set of physical servers at each discrete scheduling interval. As this problem is NP-complete, heuristic and greedy approaches may get stuck at the local minima and produce the suboptimal solution. Therefore, we proposed server residual efficiency-aware particle swarm optimization (SR-PSO) algorithm for dynamic virtual machine scheduling in this work. The classical PSO operators are tuned to suit dynamic virtual machine scheduling. The proposed bi-objective fitness function guides the proposed algorithm during the exploration of global solution space and schedules virtual machines over the physical servers operating at optimum energy efficiency or near it with minimum virtual machine migrations. A virtual machine selection algorithm is proposed that selects the virtual machines whose migration results in servers’ optimum energy efficiency. The server underload detection algorithm is proposed that categorizes servers as underloaded if they operate with energy inefficiency. The SR-PSO algorithm is aware of discrete scheduling intervals, and at each scheduling interval, only those VMs are rescheduled that are prone to service level agreement SLA violation or lower server utilization. We have used a cloudsim simulator to simulate our proposed work, and the results show significant improvement in energy consumption for the dynamic VM scheduling. More specifically, our proposed approach is 45.4% and 50% more energy efficient than the previous dynamic virtual machine scheduling approaches. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The difficulty of effectively planning and assigning weekly activities has a significant influence on the long-term productivity of an underground mine. It is an especially difficult task to choose the best places for operations inside an underground gold mine. It cannot be resolved by only selecting the levels with the highest grade of ore because the underground mine’s ore transport network has a range of capacity limitations that may prohibit the immediate mining of all the levels with the highest grade. To solve this scheduling difficulty, we formulated a new mixed-integer network flow model of the problem of weekly allocating mining operations in an underground gold mine such that the total gold mined (in ounces) was maximized subject to the transportation capacity constraints. The model was applied to an underground gold mine in Red Lake, Ontario, Canada. The results were compared to those of two greedy heuristic models that were designed to represent the decision-making heuristics that are currently used at the mine. It was found that the new model yielded solutions that improved upon the two greedy heuristics by 14.7% and 6.0%, respectively. The results of this research illustrate that the development of this optimization model can support decisions to improve a gold mine’s productivity. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The studies of earth observation satellite (EOS) scheduling for stationary targets have been increasing rapidly in recent years. However, these studies ignore EOS scheduling for moving targets (EOSSMT), which is urgently needed in many situations. EOSSMT is more complicated due to two factors, 1) location prediction of the moving targets and 2) algorithm design of EOSSMT optimization model for highly-nonlinear characteristics. In this article, we present a novel continuous monitoring scheduling methodology for moving targets by EOSs. Firstly, in order to predict the location of moving targets, a prediction-capture method, which can calculate the capture probability (CP) of the targets, is proposed. Then, based on the concept CP, we regard the EOSSMT as a stochastic integer nonlinear programming problem. Aiming to maximize observation times and duration, two objective functions with low complexity are proposed correspondingly. Finally, to solve our highly-nonlinear optimization model more efficiently, a dispersion-based heuristic (DBH) is proposed. In the computational experiments, a number of instances (scenarios), in which moving targets are successfully observed, verify the correctness and efficiency of our novel methodology for EOSSMT. Computational experiments also show that DBH can achieve better results than the Genetic Algorithm and Greedy Algorithm, with significantly less algorithm complexity. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on a cascaded flowshop joint scheduling problem (CFJSP) based on an investigation of the printed circuit board manufacturing industry, aiming at total tardiness minimization. Unlike single flowshop scheduling problems, the CFJSP can be regarded as a scheduling problem consisting of two sub-problems, i.e., distributed permutation flowshop scheduling problem (DPFSP) and hybrid flowshop scheduling problem (HFSP). The optimization process between DPFSP and HFSP becomes the key to solving this problem. We first formulate its working principle and establish a mixed-integer linear programming model. Second, we propose a population-based iterated greedy (PBIG) algorithm, whose search space alternates sequentially from phase 1 to phase 2 to explore near-optimal solutions. Meanwhile, we present an NEH-based heuristic to generate a high-quality initial solution, and a finite skip boundary reconstruction operator to explore more promising search space and reduce computational effort. The parameters and operators of the PBIG algorithms are calibrated and analyzed using the experiment design and evaluation method. We generate an applicable benchmark instance set to evaluate the PBIG algorithm against five state-of-the-art metaheuristics. Statistically sound results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PBIG algorithm for solving the CFJSP with the total tardiness objective. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

VFCC resources are provisioned to IoT applications in the form of virtual machines (VMs). Effectively utilizing VMs for diverse IoT tasks with varying requirements poses a significant challenge due to their heterogeneity in processing power, communication delay, and energy consumption. In addressing this challenge, in this article, we propose a system model for scheduling IoT tasks in VFCCs, considering not only individual task deadlines but also the system's overall energy consumption. Subsequently, we employ a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) to determine the optimal assignment of IoT tasks among VMs. GRASP, a metaheuristic-based technique, offers appealing characteristics, including simplicity, ease of implementation, a limited number of tuning parameters, and the potential for parallel implementation. Our comprehensive experiments evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparing its performance with the most advanced algorithms.

This work proposes a branch and bound algorithm for maximizing the overall sum rate over multiple interfering networks with a pre-fixed set of offered flows, as well as a heuristic algorithm that individual networks can follow to collaboratively share the available bandwidth with that same objective. The latter algorithm finds a greedy solution by independently optimizing the links and routes for each network, and then refines that solution by discarding inefficient and potentially harmful links. It does not require any direct communication between the networks, relying instead on location estimates which could be inferred from interference powers. Simulation results show that, when the networks have different traffic loads, the proposed algorithm outperforms the original greedy solution as well as those based on partitioning the resources among the networks for their exclusive use. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Traditional heuristic optimization algorithms are no longer applicable to the multiple satellites scheduling with large-scale tasks, as they are unable to provide satisfactory performance in terms of convergence and speed when addressing complex constraint conflicts. Therefore, we propose a multi-satellite cooperative scheduling method for large-scale tasks based on a hybrid graph neural network (GNN) and metaheuristic algorithm. By using the representation and extraction capability of GNN for relations in graph, the features of large-scale tasks and their constraint relations were expressed, and the generalized knowledge was extracted. And combined with metaheuristic algorithm, the optimization framework for large-scale satellite task scheduling based knowledge and data was implemented. The method consists of a GNN pre-solver module for static constraint conflicts and a metaheuristic optimization module for dynamic constraint conflicts of satellite missions. In the GNN pre-solver module, the graph sample and aggregate network was used to learn and extract the common knowledge in the static task-conflict graph, and provided effective prior information for the metaheuristic optimization module. The quadratic unconstrained binary optimization loss function was designed with multiple influencing factors, to convert the discrete optimization function into a continuous function; a greedy threshold was also added to improve the task completion rate. Finally, numerical experimental results showed that the proposed method can achieve an efficient solution to the multi-satellite scheduling problem with tens of thousands tasks. Compared with the commonly used multi-satellite scheduling algorithms (the genetic algorithm (GA) and greedy-GA), the proposed method can obtain higher-quality solutions under the same conditions and greatly improve the computational efficiency of large-scale mission planning. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study a multi-objective permutation flow shop scheduling problem with sequence independent setup time. Our optimization problem is minimizing the makespan and the total flow time in a single objective function where each criterion has a weighted factor. The principal goal is to find the optimal sequence of the jobs that minimizes the two criteria of makespan and total flow time. Our purpose is to solve this problem, with a mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) and a set of four heuristics for different size instances: the first heuristic is an algorithm with extended Johnson’s rule (EJR) and then the Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) algorithm, greedy randomized adaptive search procedure algorithm (GRASP) and path-relinking (PR) algorithm. To test the efficacy of our resolution, a series of instances with n jobs and m machines are randomly produced ranging in size from small instances. The analysis of the proposed simulation allowed us to remark that, for problems of relatively small size, the NEH heuristic has better performance for the considered problem than that of the Johnson algorithm. © 2024 Editura Politechnica.

	abstract = {Considering process planning and shop scheduling simultaneously can facilitate the integration of product design and actual manufacturing to improve production efficiency and quality. The integrated process planning and scheduling problem is a hot spot currently in the production research field. However, highly integrated systems bring a large amount of manufacturing flexibility which makes it difficult to solve. Exact methods including fail to solve large-scale problems in a short computing time. The current solving methods with good results are almost metaheuristics. But due to the randomness in the metaheuristics, the solution quality cannot be guaranteed. In the article, the optimization idea that guides deterministic exact searching under a stochastic approximate framework is mainly proposed to balance accuracy and efficiency in the optimization. Accordingly, a multimixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model collaborative optimization (MMCO) method is put forward. The submodels for exact searching optimize one individual collaboratively under a greedy searching framework. It is faster than the traditional MILP method and better than metaheuristics. The experiments on the famous Kim benchmark show that the MMCO can obtain all optimal solutions which have not been found before by the existing approaches. And these new records prove that the proposed method can effectively solve the IPPS problem. Besides, a real-world case study is conducted, and the MMCO has significant advantages in both quality and efficiency.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Distributed permutation flowshop scheduling problems (DPFSP) have become research hotspots. However, a DPFSP with tardiness and rejection costs (DPTR), which has important practical significance, has not yet been addressed. As manufacturers are most concerned about the maximization of the total profit, this study addresses the DPFSP to maximize the total profit. A mixed-integer linear programming model is used to describe the DPTR. An iterated greedy algorithm named IG_TR is proposed. IG_TR generates initial solutions using an improved NEH heuristic using four rules based on the deadline, due date, tardiness and rejection costs. For IG_TR, a dynamic number of jobs are removed from factories in the destruction phase. In the reconstruction phase, the removed jobs and those waiting to be processed are selected to be inserted into appropriate positions in the factories. Two local search methods are designed to improve the quality of solutions generated in the reconstruction phase. During the acceptance phase, a restart mechanism is proposed to avoid falling into local optimal. The experimental results of the component analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of IG_TR. Several comprehensive experiments show that IG_TR outperforms five related algorithms. © 2023},

	abstract = {In this paper, the problem of scheduling crane-operated warehouses in a triangle stacking style is investigated. In a steel supply chain, warehouses play a significant role in establishing a connection between the producer and the customers. Therefore, improving their performance results in a competitive advantage in the supply chain. One of the challenges of steel coil warehouses is the selection of outgoing coils out of the candidate coils for retrieval. Despite its importance, this problem has not been investigated in the studies relevant to steel coil warehouses. In this study, in addition to the selection of outgoing coils, sequencing of the operations on the incoming, outgoing, and blocking coils, location assignment to the incoming and blocking coils, and crane scheduling are considered in an integrated manner. First, a mixed integer linear programming model is proposed. Further, a Greedy heuristic algorithm and two metaheuristics are developed to solve large-sized instances of the problem. Metaheuristics include a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) and a hybrid algorithm that combines Ant Colony System with the GRASP (ACS-GRASP). Finally, performances of the proposed algorithms are compared over randomly generated instances as well as instances which are generated based on the real data obtained from Isfahan's Mobarakeh Steel Company. To conduct this analysis, various performance evaluation metrics are applied. Computational results indicate that ACS-GRASP converges slower than GRASP, but is more reliable and efficient. On the other hand, in large-sized instances, the Greedy algorithm runs extremely fast and can find solutions which are comparable to the metaheuristic solutions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

In this study, the energy consumption is considered in the distributed blocking flow shop scheduling problem (DBFSP). A hyperheuristic with Q-learning (HHQL) is presented to address the energy-efficient DBFSP (EEDBFSP). Q-learning is employed to select an appropriate low-level heuristic (LLH) from a predesigned LLH set according to historical information fed back by LLH. An initialization method, which considers both total tardiness (TTD) and total energy consumption (TEC), is proposed to construct the initial population. The ϵ-greedy strategy is introduced to utilize the learned knowledge while retaining a certain degree of exploration in the process of selecting LLH. The acceleration operation of the job on the critical path is designed to optimize TTD. The deceleration operation of the job on the noncritical path is designed to optimize TEC. The statistical and computational experimentation in an extensive benchmark testified that the HHQL outperforms the other comparison algorithm regarding efficiency and significance in solving EEDBFSP.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the proliferation in the internet of things (IoT), a variety of delay sensitive applications have emerged over the past few years. Fog computing acts a viable computing paradigm for meeting the requirements of IoT applications. However, heterogeneous IoT tasks, resource constrained fog nodes makes task scheduling a challenging task. Efficient task scheduling reduces the computation cost, latency, energy and enhances the utilization of resources. In this paper, we propose the improved version of the meta-heuristic algorithm spider monkey optimization (SMO). We propose greedy task scheduling SMO (gTS-SMO) and semi-greedy task scheduling SMO (sgTS-SMO) for efficient task scheduling in fog computing environment. The main aim is minimize delay and energy consumption while considering the constraints of deadline and violation time. The system is evaluated based on the parameters of deadline violation time, makespan, energy consumption, total cost, and degree of imbalance. The results shows gTS-SMO reduces the violation time by 13.86%, 88.38% on comparison with sgTS-SMO and particle swarm optimization (PSO) respectively. The results also depicts the outperformance of gTS-SMO in terms of makespan and energy consumption. Makespan is reduced by 6.28%, and 57.75% and energy consumption by 5.74% and 53.65% on comparison with sgTS-SMO and PSO respectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the multi-robot task assignment problem in which a fleet of dispersed robots needs to efficiently transport a set of dynamically appearing packages from their initial locations to corresponding destinations within prescribed time-windows. Each robot can carry multiple packages simultaneously within its capacity. Given a sufficiently large robot fleet, the objective is to minimize the robots' total travel time to transport the packages within their respective time-window constraints. The problem is shown to be NP-hard, and we design two group-based distributed auction algorithms to solve this task assignment problem. Guided by the auction algorithms, robots first distributively calculate feasible package groups that they can serve, and then communicate to find an assignment of package groups. We quantify the potential of the algorithms with respect to the number of employed robots and the capacity of the robots by considering the robots' total travel time to transport all packages. Simulation results show that the designed algorithms are competitive compared with an exact centralized Integer Linear Program representation solved with the commercial solver Gurobi, and superior to popular greedy algorithms and a heuristic distributed task allocation method. Note to Practitioners - This work presents two group-based distributed auction algorithms for a sufficiently large fleet of robots to efficiently transport a set of dynamically appearing dispersed packages from their initial locations to corresponding destinations within prescribed time-windows. Each robot can carry multiple packages simultaneously within its capacity, and the objective is to minimize the robots' total travel time to transport all the packages within the prescribed time-windows. The paper's practical contributions are threefold: First, the multi-robot task assignment problem is formulated through a robot-group assignment strategy, which enables complex logistic scheduling for tasks grouped according to their distributions and time-windows. Second, we theoretically show that the multi-robot task assignment problem is an NP-hard problem, which implies the necessity for designing approximate task assignment algorithms. Third, the proposed group-based distributed auction algorithms are efficient and can be adapted for real scenarios.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the increase in production levels, a pattern of industrial production has shifted from a single factory to multiple factories, resulting in a distributed production model. The distributed flowshop scheduling problem (DPFSP) is of great research significance as a frequent pattern in real production activities. In this paper, according to real-world scenarios, we have added blocking constraints and sequence-dependent setup times (SDST) to the DFSP and proposed a distributed blocking flowshop scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times (DBFSP_SDST). In a distributed environment, the allocation of resources and utilization have become an urgent problem to be solved. In addition, scheduling problems related to resource conservation have also attracted increasing attention. Therefore, we study DBFSP_SDST and consider minimizing the energy consumption cost of the critical factory (critical factory is the factory with maximum energy consumption cost) under resource balance. To tackle this problem, an effective iterated greedy algorithm based on a learning-based variable neighborhood search algorithm (VNIG) is proposed. In VNIG, an efficient construction heuristic is well designed. Two different local searches based on the characteristics of the proposed problem are developed to enhance the local exploitation by neighborhood searching. A learning-based selection variable neighborhood search strategy is designed to avoid the solution trapping in local optima. By conducting extensive simulation experiments, the proposed VNIG shows superior performance compared with artificial chemical reaction optimization (CRO, 2017), the discrete artificial bee colony algorithm (DABC, 2018), the iterative greedy algorithm with a variable neighborhood search scheme (IGR, 2021), and the evolution strategy approach (ES, 2022). © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

In our case, each machine requires a certain setup time to process all the different jobs assigned to it. Hence, this setup time will be independent of sequence of jobs, but will depend only on the nature of machine. The optimization objective is to minimize the maximum tardiness criterion. To solve this optimization problem, an exact method, heuristics and metaheuristics are the three main resolution methods that we have used. The exact method is represented by the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. In terms of the second category of resolution methods, we have been focused on two methods, the first is a modified heuristic based on Johnson rule (HBJR) while the second is based on the Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) algorithm. Finally, three metaheuristics have been used, namely the iterated local search (ILS) method, the iterated greedy (IG) algorithm and the genetic algorithm (GA). Our numerical results indicate that for the problems with small size instances, the NEH heuristic outperforms HBJR approach, while for relatively large size instances, the developed IG algorithm gives best results than both other metaheuristics ILS and GA.  © The authors.},

	abstract = {Hadoop is a distributed framework for processing big data. One of the critical parts of Hadoop is YARN, which carries out scheduling and resource management. A scheduling algorithm should consider multiple objectives. However, YARN schedulers do not consider the Service Level Agreement (SLA) and the energy-related issues. The present paper proposes an energy-efficient deadline-aware model for the scheduling problem. The scheduling issue is an NP-hard problem regarding the deadline of applications and reducing energy. Hence, an Energy-efficient Deadline-aware Scheduling Algorithm based on the Moth-Flame Optimization algorithm (EDSA-MFO) is suggested to minimize the energy consumption and execute the application within a given soft deadline. Moreover, the earliest deadline first-based (EDF-based) heuristic approach is proposed to decode a moth into a scheduling solution. The algorithm is implemented for both static and dynamic scheduling. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, extensive simulations are conducted. The outcomes demonstrated that the suggested method could find near-optimal scheduling. It outperforms the YARN default FIFO scheduler, EDF, the energy-aware greedy algorithm (EAGA), and the deadline-aware energy-efficient MapReduce scheduling algorithm for YARN (EMRSAY) in total cluster energy consumption and meeting job deadline. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Networks play a crucial role in our daily lives by efficiently delivering multimedia services. However, network operators face the challenge of ensuring efficient resource provisioning while balancing profit maximization and environmental objectives. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as an approach for resource allocation, leveraging observed data to make near-optimal decisions. However, the dynamic and complex nature of large-scale environments, such as wireless networks, poses challenges in designing appropriate rewards for DRL agents. This study investigates the feasibility of parallelization approaches to create network environments that facilitate efficient and generalizable learning for DRL algorithms. We propose two service provisioning solutions: DRL-MCTS for wireless networks and DRL-VNF for wired networks. These solutions prioritize green network objectives, including minimizing power consumption for nodes and links and selecting low carbon-emitting links. We compare our proposals to baseline methods, including a greedy algorithm, WMMSE, and the optimal solution. Through extensive experimental evaluations, our methods demonstrate significant improvements in reducing the network's environmental footprint while meeting Quality of Service requirements. In specific scenarios, our proposed solutions outperform the baseline approaches by up to 55%.  © 2017 IEEE.},

The objective is to minimize the changes in the level of resource usage from period to period over the planning horizon of the project while keeping the project duration fixed. First, we present two novel greedy schedule algorithms for the RLP solution. The performance of the proposed algorithms is investigated as low-level hybrids in the context of three famous population-based heuristics, namely differential evolution (DE), genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Then, we additionally present two new high-level hybridization schemes (HS), referred to herein as parallel and serial HS, respectively, which combine DE, GA, and PSO in a single hybrid solution algorithm. Detailed experimentation over known complex datasets measures the efficiency of the new hybrids. Statistical analysis employed rank the hybrids according to their solution efficiency. Moreover, comparisons between the developed best hybrid and commercial project management software show a substantial higher performance for the former over real-world construction projects. © 2024, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {More enterprises are facing rapid and changing market demand and small but frequent orders, and they extend the production capability of manufacturing systems to respond to these changes. This paper studies a distributed heterogeneous hybrid flow shop lot-streaming scheduling problem (DHHFLSP) with the minimization of makespan. In the DHHFLSP, the processing capacity of each factory is different and each job can be split into several sub-lots. These sub-lots are assigned to several non-identical factories. The mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP) of DHHFLSP is established. To solve the DHHFLSP, eighteen constructive heuristics and an iterated local search algorithm (ILS) are designed. In constructive heuristics, the jobs are sorted according to several time-based heuristic rules or they are divided into several groups according to bottleneck stages, and then these jobs are assigned into factories through two NEH-based job assignment rules. In the ILS, the NEH-based heuristic (NEHafter) plus Largest medium rule is used to generate an initial solution. Two greedy insertion operators with or without critical factories are adopted to generate the perturbation solutions. Four greedy local search operators are designed to make a deep search. The influence of the parameters and main components are investigated by a comprehensive analysis. The comparisons with several related algorithms on extensive testing instances demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the ILS algorithm. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing interest in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) research in the Industrial Internet of Things(IIoT). The research on real-time and reliable IIoT transmission technology based on TSN has received extensive attention. Especially in some industrial scenarios, such as the safety monitoring of the underground construction environment, the real-time and reliability of data transmission is very important due to the long tunnel and complex structure in underground mining. It is a huge challenge to ensure that the data collected by the sensor has a slight end-to-end delay to the receiving end. A routing scheduling method is proposed based on TSN for IIoT applications in underground mining. Firstly, according to the characteristics of large-scale and distributed hybrid topology in mines and the delay constraints of TSN, the multi-hop routing cooperative scheduling problem S is defined. It is proved that the problem is NP-Hard. Secondly, two algorithms are proposed for problem S: (1) greedy algorithm based on local shortest delay; (2) heuristic algorithm based on an ant colony. Finally, a comparative experimental analysis of the proposed algorithm is carried out, proving that this paper's algorithm performs better in terms of delay and jitter. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

This algorithm is based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP) with speed-up routines. The model considers station capacities explicitly (i.e., the number of available tracks for meeting and overtaking operations). Because the model is too hard for the solvers (CPLEX in this study) to tackle, three speed-up routines were devised when rescheduling trains. These routines are a greedy heuristic to reduce the solution space, using the lazy constraint attribute of the solver and a multiobjective approach to find a good initial feasible solution that conforms to actual railway operation. The algorithm was tested on a hypothetical rail line for different sizes of timetable instances with disturbed trains in a maximum two-hour time horizon. It managed to solve the hardest instances within a three-minute time limit thus minimizing the total weighted delay of rescheduled trains. The optimality gap metric is used to show the effectiveness and efficiencies of the speed-up heuristics developed. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In a disaster scenario, relief items distribution is required as early as possible for the disaster victims to reduce the associated risks. For the distribution tasks, an effective and efficient relief items distribution model is essential to generate relief items distribution schedules to minimise the impact of disaster to the disaster victims. However, developing efficient distribution schedules is challenging as the relief items distribution problem has multiple objectives to look after where the objectives are mostly contradictorily creating a barrier to simultaneous optimisation of each objective. Also, the relief items distribution model has added complexity with the consideration of multiple supply points having heterogeneous and limited vehicles with varying capacity, cost and time. In this paper, multi-objective evolutionary optimisation with the greedy heuristic search has been applied for the generation of relief items distribution schedules under heterogeneous vehicles condition at supply points. The evolutionary algorithm generates the disaster region distribution sequence by applying a global greedy heuristic search along with a local search that finds the efficient assignment of heterogeneous vehicles for the distribution. This multi-objective evolutionary approach provides Pareto optimal solutions that decision-makers can apply to generate effective distribution schedules to optimise the distribution time and vehicles’ operational cost. In addition, this optimisation process also incorporated the minimisation of unmet relief items demand at the disaster regions. The optimised distribution schedules with the proposed approach are compared with the single-objective optimisation, weighted single-objective optimisation and greedy multi-objective optimisation approaches. The comparative results showed that the proposed multi-objective evolutionary approach is an efficient alternative for finding the distribution schedules with optimisation of distribution time and operational cost for the relief items distribution with heterogeneous vehicles in humanitarian crisis. © 2022 The Author(s)},

After maintenance, the machine energy consumption cost returns to the normal level. Thus, an important decision is how to determine a reasonable number of maintenance activities to enable a significant tradeoff between the maintenance cost and the energy consumption cost. We define the jobs processed between two adjacent maintenance activities as a batch since the job processing cannot be interrupted. A further decision is how to batch the jobs. To solve the investigated problem, we first study a special case where there is only one single machine. A heuristic approach is proposed to solve the single machine scheduling problem. Then, we present a variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm for general cases, where the heuristic approach for the single machine case is intergrated. Extensive computational experiments are conducted and the results show that the proposed VNS algorithm is superior to artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, Tabu search (TS)algorithm, and greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) algorithm. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC) has emerged as a captivating research paradigm to increase computing resources for Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications. However, the allocation of the best possible computing resources is challenging due to the enormous growth of services in vehicular networks, such as augmented reality, 3-D gaming, autonomous driving, etc., and their severe delay limitations, processing demands, and mobility of vehicles. Mainly, achieving strict task latency is a challenging problem while vehicles traverse through the roadside unit (RSU) regions. In this work, the vehicle’s task processing latency and energy consumption are considered by deciding which tasks should be scheduled to either the local RSU or the neighbour RSUs along the vehicle’s path. We study the mobility-aware task scheduling problem to jointly optimize the service latency of the tasks and energy consumption of the vehicles. Initially, we employ the Markov renewal process (MRP) to model the vehicle’s mobility. Subsequently, we establish that our proposed objective function is a monotone submodular function and provide a greedy heuristic for the maximization of the submodular function with an approximation of (1 − e1 ). Further, we propose a hybrid optimization algorithm that combines particle swarm optimization (PSO) and simulated annealing (SA) algorithms to solve mobility-aware task scheduling problems for large-scale networks. We compare our proposed algorithm with existing mobility-aware scheduling approaches and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs efficiently for task scheduling problems. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The flowshop is the most often used production system in the sector, and several efforts have been made to improve its efficiency. The NEH (Nawaz, Enscore and Ham) heuristics are one of the promising techniques. The range includes using heuristics and metaheuristics. By adopting a modified version of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, which has the disadvantage of a slow converge speed, this study aims to boost NEH. To find high-quality results with a faster convergence rate, this study developed a strategy to increase the convergence speed of ABC. Because of the significant performance in the makespan value (performance indicator), the Total Greedy was adopted in this study, and the author continued to use it throughout the remainder of the research. This study suggested creating a Guided Artificial Bee Colony (GABC) using the First Job Sequence Arrangement Method and the NEH idea. The investigation was based on Taillard benchmark datasets. According to the findings, ABC frequently gave inconsistent outcomes, but surprisingly, GABC, NEH-based ABC, and ABC consistently produced results that were each 68.75%, 63.33%, and 0.01% better than NEH. Finally, the author can state that this analysis validated ABC's slow convergence problem solutions. © 2024, Semarak Ilmu Publishing. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The optimization of scheduling in industrial manufacturing is a crucial concern in operations research. In this paper, a range of of methodological approaches for solving the permutation flow shop scheduling problem with a sequence-dependent setup. The goal is to minimize the total weighted flow time while ensuring no waiting jobs in the production process. The proposed solution methodology encompasses eight population-based meta-heuristics and the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) method. The employed population-based meta-heuristics include migratory bird optimization, the artificial bee colony algorithm, iterated greedy and iterative local search algorithms. Various approaches, incorporating local search procedures, are developed to explore neighboring solutions. Furthermore, two constructive algorithms namely the Nawaz-Enscore and Ham (NEH) algorithm and the greedy random adaptive search procedure (GRASP), are proposed for generating best sequences in the initial phase. In total, eight population-based meta-heuristics : PIGNEH, PIGGRASP, PILSNEH, PILSGRASP, MBONEH, MBOGRASP, ABCNEH and ABCGRASP are presented to investigate the manufacturing optimization problem. To evaluate the efficiency of the approach proposed for the algorithms, a comprehensive set of tests is conducted on instances of varying sizes. The simulation shows that the population-based iterated greedy algorithm enhanced by the NEH procedure (PIGNEH) performs best compared to other algorithms. Indeed, the PIGNEH meta-heuristic demonstrates a success rate of 81.14% and achieves a minimum percentage relative deviation value of 0.0234%. © King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals 2024.},

	abstract = {In intrusion detection wireless sensor network (WSN), ensuring detection performance and prolonging network lifetime are two equally important but contradictory pursuits. In this paper, we propose a node scheduling scheme jointly considering the detection probability, energy consumption, and energy balance to ensure the detection performance and maximize the network lifetime. We mathematically transform the scheduling process into an optimization problem and further propose a novel mechanism called greedy-like step-by-step trimming heuristic algorithm (GLSTA) to obtain the optimal task nodes set. By gradually trimming unnecessary nodes, GLSTA intelligently eliminates redundancy and obtains a task set that can save energy and balance the residual energy of nodes. Moreover, we propose a dual cluster head (OCH-DCH, organization cluster head-data cluster head) scheme to realize the smooth update of the cluster due to the target movement. Simulation results show that the rounds of half nodes death of GLSTA are extended by at least 28.6% compared with existing mechanisms. © 2023 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University},

	abstract = {The flow shop scheduling problem is important for the manufacturing industry. Effective flow shop scheduling can bring great benefits to the industry. However, there are few types of research on Distributed Hybrid Flow Shop Problems (DHFSP) by learning assisted meta-heuristics. This work addresses a DHFSP with minimizing the maximum completion time (Makespan). First, a mathematical model is developed for the concerned DHFSP. Second, four Q-learning-assisted meta-heuristics, e.g., genetic algorithm (GA), artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolution (DE), are proposed. According to the nature of DHFSP, six local search operations are designed for finding high-quality solutions in local space. Instead of random selection, Q-learning assists meta-heuristics in choosing the appropriate local search operations during iterations. Finally, based on 60 cases, comprehensive numerical experiments are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The experimental results and discussions prove that using Q-learning to select appropriate local search operations is more effective than the random strategy. To verify the competitiveness of the Q-learning assistedmeta-heuristics, they are compared with the improved iterated greedy algorithm (IIG), which is also for solving DHFSP. The Friedman test is executed on the results by five algorithms. It is concluded that the performance of four Q-learning-assisted meta-heuristics are better than IIG, and the Q-learning-assisted PSO shows the best competitiveness. Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

Based on the distributed hybrid flowshop scheduling problem (DHFSP) and blocking constraints, a mathematical model of mixed integer linear programming for the DHBFSP is proposed, and a hybrid genetic algorithm is developed. Eight new heuristics are defined in the process of population initialization according to the blocking characteristics of the problem, and five heuristic rules are chosen through experiments for population initialization and the rest of the individuals are generated randomly. Offspring individuals are obtained through crossover and mutation operations, while an offspring selection strategy is proposed to make decisions in the population offspring selection. The destruction and reconstruction (DR) operation is performed for the optimal individuals of the offspring population to optimize their individual structures, and a local search method is adopted for the deep search of individuals.

On account of the widespread applications of large region observation, this article aims to address the EOSs observation scheduling problem for large region targets. A rapid coverage calculation method employing a projection reference plane and a polygon clipping technique is first developed. We then formulate a nonlinear integer programming model for the scheduling problem, where the objective function is calculated based on the developed coverage calculation method. A greedy initialization-based resampling particle swarm optimization (GI-RPSO) algorithm is proposed to solve the model. The adopted greedy initialization strategy and particle resampling method contribute to generating efficient and effective solutions during the evolution process. In the end, extensive experiments are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method.

	abstract = {Due to the generation and transmission of video data, the high energy consumption rates of wireless nodes result in short lifetime of a visual sensor network, which has been commonly deployed in 3D space. In many applications, lots of targets need to be covered, but the budgets of both deployment and maintenance are limited. Therefore, how to maximize total weighted target coverage while prolonging network lifetime is of great significance. This work investigates the maximum weighted target coverage deployment of a rechargeable visual sensor network charged by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in 3D space, which should ensure network permanence and satisfy the budgets of both deployment and maintenance. In this problem, since UAV has a limited energy capacity, it is allowed to return to the depot for energy replenishment more than once in each charging period of wireless nodes so as to increase target coverage. After formulating this problem as a mixed integer nonlinear program, this work proposes a greedy heuristic and a particle swarm optimizer to approximately solve this NP-hard problem. Extensive simulation results reveal that the latter can deliver a better solution despite consuming more time than the former.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Along with the growth of computing requirements, edge devices, such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles, are equipped with heterogeneous multiprocessor systems to cope with complicated missions, including attitude control, signal processing, and objective detection. Concerning the extremely limited power on these devices, reducing the energy and time overhead of task execution evolves into a crucial challenge. Therefore, a multiobjective energy-efficient task scheduling technique (METSM) is proposed. First, a mathematical model is established for the energy-efficient task scheduling problem on edge heterogeneous multiprocessor systems. In this model, both makespan and total energy consumption are the optimization objectives. The decision variables include the task execution sequence, processor assignment, and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling level for each processor. Second, a problem-specific algorithm, namely, iterated greedy-based multiobjective optimizer (IMO), is proposed. Specifically, destruction–reconstruction and local search are redesigned for optimizing task scheduling and resource allocation. Considering local optima avoidance, a probabilistic mutation operation is developed. In addition, multiobjective-oriented strategies of optimal solution selection and acceptance criteria are adopted to accelerate the convergence. Finally, our proposed IMO is compared with several of the latest algorithms through multiple performance metrics. The experimental results show that IMO can obtain optimal Pareto fronts among several multiobjective methods. Savings of approximately 10% and 12% in time and power consumption, respectively, can be achieved by IMO. Moreover, in comparison with classic list-based heuristics for solving test cases, while IMO maintains a similar makespan, energy is reduced by nearly 90%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This article investigates a distributed assembly no-wait flow-shop scheduling problem (DANWFSP), which has important applications in manufacturing systems. The objective is to minimize the total flowtime. A mixed-integer linear programming model of DANWFSP with total flowtime criterion is proposed. A population-based iterated greedy algorithm (PBIGA) is presented to address the problem. A new constructive heuristic is presented to generate an initial population with high quality. For DANWFSP, an accelerated NR3 algorithm is proposed to assign jobs to the factories, which improves the efficiency of the algorithm and saves CPU time. To enhance the effectiveness of the PBIGA, the local search method and the destruction-construction mechanisms are designed for the product sequence and job sequence, respectively. A selection mechanism is presented to determine, which individuals execute the local search method. An acceptance criterion is proposed to determine whether the offspring are adopted by the population. Finally, the PBIGA and seven state-of-the-art algorithms are tested on 810 large-scale benchmark instances. The experimental results show that the presented PBIGA is an effective algorithm to address the problem and performs better than recently state-of-the-art algorithms compared in this article.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an improved Beluga Whale Optimization algorithm based on data mining and scheduling rules with AdaBoost(IBWO-DDR-AdaBoost) rule heuristic scheduling method for solving job-shop scheduling problems (JSP) is proposed, in which data mining-extracted dispatching rules are incorporated into the heuristic algorithm to guide the optimization process. Firstly, an AdaBoost-CART integrated learning algorithm is introduced to evolve dispatching knowledge from historical data and convert it into effective dispatching rules. Secondly, in order to address the issues of local optimality and slow convergence speed faced by the beluga whale optimization algorithm (BWO) when solving JSP, this study presents an improved beluga whale optimization algorithm (IBWO) that incorporates two enhancement mechanisms: a neighborhood search strategy based on greedy thinking and genetic operators. These enhancements aim to improve both the efficiency and quality of reconciliation in scheduling, ultimately leading to better scheduling schemes. Furthermore, the extracted scheduling rules obtained through the AdaBoost-CART integrated learning algorithm are embedded into the improved beluga optimization algorithm, enabling real-time solution updates for optimized schedules. Finally, extensive simulation tests are conducted on JSP benchmark examples of varying scales with minimizing maximum completion time as the objective function for schedule optimization. The simulation results demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed IBWO-DDR-AdaBoost rule heuristic scheduling method in terms of accuracy, performance optimization, and convergence speed. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Scheduling problem with blocking is an attractive research direction due to its wide practical applications. However, in the distributed hybrid flow shop problem (DHFSP), there are few studies on blocking constraints. In this article, we study a distributed hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with blocking constraints (DBHFSP), where the goal is to minimize the maximum completion time, and propose a tri-individual iterated greedy (TIG) algorithm based on the characteristics of the DBHFSP. First, an active decoding strategy is designed to reduce the idle time of machines. Afterward, a framework of multiple iterative solutions is designed to enhance the diversity of the solutions, in which the multiple solutions are generated through a neighborhood search. Then, a heuristic rule based on blocking constraint is proposed to generate promising initial solutions. In addition, an insertion-based search strategy based on rotating critical factories is designed to accelerate the convergence speed of the TIG algorithm. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms and classical intelligent optimization algorithms. The experimental results show that the TIG algorithm is superior to the comparison algorithm in solving the DBHFSP. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {As a product of modern development, logistics plays a significant role in economic growth with its advantages of integrated management, unified operations, and speed. With the rapid advancement of technology and economy, traditional manual storage and retrieval methods can no longer meet industry demands. Achieving efficient storage and retrieval of goods on densely packed, symmetrically shaped logistics shelves has become a critical issue that needs urgent resolution. The brain storm optimization (BSO) algorithm, introduced in 2010, has found extensive applications across various fields. This paper presents a modified BSO algorithm (MBSO) aimed at addressing the scheduling challenges of double-end automated storage and retrieval systems (DE-AS/RSs). Traditional AS/RSs suffer from slow scheduling efficiency and the current heuristic algorithms exhibit low accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new scheduling strategy for the stacker to select I/O stations in DE-AS/RSs. The MBSO incorporates two key enhancements to the basic BSO algorithm. First, it employs an objective space clustering method in place of the standard k-means clustering to achieve more accurate solutions for AS/RS scheduling problems. Second, it utilizes a mutation operation based on a greedy strategy and an improved crossover operation for updating individuals. Extensive comparisons were made between the well-known heuristic algorithms NIGA and BSO in several specific enterprise warehouse scenarios. The experimental results show that the MBSO has significant accuracy, optimization speed, and robustness in solving scheduling of AS/RSs. © 2024 by the authors.},

In this study, to solve this real-time optimization problem, an efficient discrete differential evolution-driven approach named DDE is proposed. The DDE includes discrete versions of mutation and crossover schemes together with a usual selection operation. Furthermore, an additional operator called greedy local search operation is combined with the search procedure of the DDE to increase the convergence speed. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted on 32 different traffic case studies generated based on the infrastructure of traffic network in Jurong area of Singapore. The optimization results produced by the DDE are compared with the optimal results achieved by the commercial GUROBI solver. The performance of the DDE is also compared with other metaheuristics namely ABC, GA, HS, Jaya, DSCA and DSCA-LS, which are designed in the literature to solve the TLSP. The performance comparison is analyzed using diverse metrics such as statistical values of optimization results, statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, average relative error percentage, and convergence analysis. The comparison illustrates the significantly better and promising search ability of the DDE as compared to the other metaheuristics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a strategic solution to address the increasing demand for cellular connectivity in rural, remote, and disaster-hit regions lacking traditional infrastructure. However, UAVs’ limited onboard energy storage necessitates optimized, energy-efficient communication strategies and intelligent energy expenditure to maximize productivity. This work proposes a novel joint optimization model to coordinate charging operations across multiple UAVs functioning as aerial base stations. The model optimizes charging station assignments and trajectories to maximize UAV flight time and minimize overall energy expenditure. By leveraging both static ground base stations and mobile supercharging stations for opportunistic charging while considering battery chemistry constraints, the mixed integer linear programming approach reduces energy usage by 9.1 ​% versus conventional greedy heuristics. The key results provide insights into separating charging strategies based on UAV mobility patterns, fully utilizing all available infrastructure through balanced distribution, and strategically leveraging existing base stations before deploying dedicated charging assets. Compared to myopic localized decisions, the globally optimized solution extends battery life and enhances productivity. Overall, this work marks a significant advance in UAV energy management by consolidating multiple improvements within a unified coordination framework focused on joint charging optimization across UAV fleets. The model lays a critical foundation for energy-efficient aerial network deployments to serve the connectivity needs of the future. © 2023 The Author(s)},

In this article, the BAP for multiple continuous quays and dynamic arrivals is considered. The formulation considers the tidal constraints typical to exporting bulk terminals and restrictions regarding each vessel's possible quays. To solve the problem, a mixed-integer linear model is first presented. As the complexity of the problem grows exponentially with the size of the instances, an Iterated Local Search (ILS) approach is proposed to solve industrial-sized instances. The ILS approach works on sequences of vessels that are decoded using a bottom-left constructive heuristic. The initial sequences are obtained using a greedy scheduling heuristic that provides suitable starting solutions, especially for congested terminals. Extensive numerical experiments are carried on randomly generated instances for tidal bulk terminals and reported benchmark sets in literature. The results prove that the proposed ILS can provide good-quality solutions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

This article deals with a new variant of this problem, the MSPSP with partial preemption, where only a subset of resources can be released during the preemption periods. Like the standard problem, this variant is NP-hard, because of which we propose in this article a series of heuristic algorithms to solve instances arising from an industrial application. First, we present a serial greedy algorithm, based on priority rules and a flow problem for resource allocation. To improve the solutions of the greedy algorithm, we then introduce a binary tree based search algorithm and a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP). Finally, we propose a large neighborhood search (LNS) algorithm integrating exact and heuristic methods. The best results in terms of solution quality and execution time are obtained by combining the GRASP algorithm and LNS approach. Furthermore, the proposed GRASP algorithm is able to find new best results on 56 of 216 instances on a standard MSPSP instance set, which shows the quality of the approach even on special cases of the considered problem. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Benefiting from the flexible, scalable and secure environment, hybrid cloud can overcome the shortage of limited resources in private cloud to simultaneously execute large-scale scientific workflows. In hybrid cloud, privacy-sensitive tasks are not allowed to be executed on public resources, while non-sensitive tasks are unrestricted. As an NP-Complete problem, it is extraordinarily challenging to schedule multiple workflows efficiently, economically and energy-savingly under quality-of-service constraints. This paper models the hybrid-cloud-based privacy-aware multi-workflow scheduling as a tri-objective optimization problem that optimizes workflow-oriented total tardiness, private-cloud-oriented total energy consumption, and public-cloud-oriented total monetary cost. To the best of authors’ knowledge, few studies have been conducted on the tri-objective privacy-aware multi-workflow scheduling in hybrid cloud (PMWS-HC). To solve this problem, we dissect various factors involved during task scheduling and devise a novel Heuristic Scheduling Algorithm based on 9 Factors (HSA9Fs), which dynamically selects the workflows and tasks to be scheduled, and the corresponding VMs to execute them. To optimize the three conflicting objectives simultaneously, we propose a nested algorithm called MSIA, which first employs a Multi-objective Salp swarm algorithm to explore for the Pareto solutions, and then uses an Iterative greedy Algorithm to perform a refined search on individuals to obtain high-quality solutions. Extensive Medium-Small-Scale and Large-Scale simulation experiments show that both HSA9Fs and MSIA outperform state-of-the-art scheduling algorithms in several multi-objective performance metrics. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with ultra-dense sensors are crucial for several industries, such as smart agricultural systems deployed in the fifth generation (5G) and beyond 5G Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN). The WSNs employ multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from multiple sensor nodes (SNs) and relay it to the central controller for processing. UAVs also provide resources to SNs and extend the network coverage over a vast geographical area. The O-RAN allows the use of open standards and interfaces to create a wireless network for communications between the UAVs and ground SNs. It enables real-time data transfer, remote control, and other applications that require a reliable and high-speed connection by providing flexibility and reliability for UAV-assisted WSNs to meet the requirements of smart agricultural applications. However, the limited battery life of UAVs, transmission power, and shortage of energy resources SNs make it difficult to collect all the data and relay it to the base station, resulting in inefficient task computation and resource management in smart agricultural systems. In this paper, we propose a joint UAV task scheduling, trajectory planning, and resource-sharing framework for multi-UAV-assisted WSNs for smart agricultural monitoring scenarios that schedule UAVs' charging, data collection, and landing times and allow UAVs to share energy with SNs. The main objective of our proposed framework is to minimize the UAV energy consumption and network latency for effective data collection within a specific time frame. We formulate the multi-objective, which is a non-convex optimization problem, and transform it into a Markov decision process (MDP) with a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed MADRL algorithm reduces the energy consumption cost when compared to deep Q-network, Greedy, and mixed-integer linear program (MILP) by 61.92%, 68.02%, and 69.9%, respectively. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Aircraft icing due to severe cold and local factors increases the risk of flight delays and safety issues. Therefore, this study focuses on optimizing de-icing allocation and adapting to dynamic flight schedules at medium to large airports. Moreover, it aims to establish a centralized de-icing methodology employing unmanned de-icing vehicles to achieve the dual objectives of minimizing flight delay times and enhancing airport de-icing efficiency. To achieve these goals, a mixed-integer bi-level programming model is formulated, where the upper-level planning guides the allocation of de-icing positions and the lower-level planning addresses the collaborative scheduling of the multiple unmanned de-icing vehicles. In addition, a two-stage algorithm is introduced, encompassing a Mixed Variable Neighborhood Search Genetic Algorithm (MVNS-GA) as well as a Multi-Strategy Enhanced Heuristic Greedy Algorithm (MSEH-GA). Both algorithms are rigorously assessed through horizontal comparisons. This demonstrates the effectiveness and competitiveness of these algorithms. Finally, a model simulation is conducted at a major northwestern hub airport in China, providing empirical evidence of the proposed approach’s efficiency. The results show that research offers a practical solution for optimizing the use of multiple unmanned de-icing vehicles in aircraft de-icing tasks at medium to large airports. Therefore, delays are mitigated, and de-icing operations are improved. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Aviation emergency rescue has become one of the most effective means for natural disaster relief due to its flexible and timely characteristics. A reasonable emergency dispatch plan can guarantee the effective implementation of all the rescue measures. Most of previous studies in this area focused on the scheduling and routing but ignored the impact of the specific rescue process, for example the fuel consumption of various helicopters. In this paper, a multi-helicopter-multi-trip Aviation Rescue Routing Problem (ARRP) is analysed which covers the whole rescue process. In addition, a time-domain procedural simulation model is built which can consider different helicopters, refueling or not, various resource locations, multiple disaster sites and other operation factors. Based on that, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) hybridized Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithm (GA-LNS) is proposed for optimization. In ARRP, single search algorithm may lead to the local optimum due to complexity. In contrast, the distance greedy strategy and the load ratio strategy are combined in GA-LNS which can fix the local optimum problem. More specifically, based on the helicopter-tagged-task-sequenced chromosome, the single-point crossover operator is used in GA and then, the worst removal strategy and the first/last insertion strategy are adopted in LNS. Finally, the numerical experiments are exercised to verify the effectiveness of the proposed GA-LNS algorithm which is compared with three traditional basic heuristic algorithms and a stateof-the-art memetic algorithm.  © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Owing to the different quantities and processing times of sub-lots, intermingling sub-lots with each other, instead of fixing the production sequence of sub-lots of a lot as in the existing studies, is a more practical approach to lot-streaming flow shops. Hence, a lot-streaming hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with consistent and intermingled sub-lots (LHFSP-CIS) was studied. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model was established, and a heuristic-based adaptive iterated greedy algorithm (HAIG) with three modifications was designed to solve the problem. Specifically, a two-layer encoding method was proposed to decouple the sub-lot-based connection. Two heuristics were embedded in the decoding process to reduce the manufacturing cycle. Based on this, a heuristic-based initialization is proposed to improve the performance of the initial solution; an adaptive local search with four specific neighborhoods and an adaptive strategy has been structured to improve the exploration and exploitation ability. Besides, an acceptance criterion of inferior solutions has been improved to promote global optimization ability. The experiment and the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test (p = 0) showed the significant advantages of HAIG in effectiveness and robustness compared with five state-of-the-art algorithms. An industrial case study verifies that intermingling sub-lots is an effective technique to enhance the utilization ratio of machines and shorten the manufacturing cycle. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses an integrated rack assignment and robot routing problem arising in robotic movable fulfillment systems (RMFS). This NP-hard planning task goes beyond current literature by simultaneously optimizing movable rack selection and multi-agent collision-free path finding, rather than decomposing them. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model with a new level-space-time network representation is proposed, jointly considering reusable racks, robot-rack pairings, storage repositioning, and collision avoidance. To improve computational efficiency, a fast rolling horizon heuristic and greedy algorithm are developed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the integrated method's solutions can improve by 30 % upon conventional decomposed approaches. Intriguing test cases reveal the model, suggesting non-intuitive robot carryover policies that are unfound by separate selection and routing methods. This indicates potential optimization benefits from explicitly coordinating task assignment, scheduling, and routing decisions in complex automated warehousing systems. The rolling horizon heuristic solutions approach optimality with much greater efficiency than directly solving one large MIP, validating its practical value. This research provides useful integrated modeling insights, efficient solution algorithms, and decision support for efficiently controlling next-generation robotic movable fulfillment systems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Backbone-Assisted PD-NOMA provides a feasible way to lowering power consumptions, since scheduling flexibilities are further enhanced by sharing both decoding capabilities of wireline-connected multiple sinks and the geographical diversity of the sinks. In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing uplink power consumption sum for backbone-assisted PD-NOMA wireless networks, under the constraint of given uplink delay bound. We formulate the problem, and prove that it is NP-Complete by presenting an original reduction from the classic problem of partition into triangles, which is known to be NP-Complete. We further propose a low-complexity heuristic algorithm based on the greedy strategy that as many user equipments as possible are simultaneously scheduled in one slot, which is also the optimal for one sink scenario. The analysis based on experimental results shows that the power consumption sum achieved by the heuristic algorithm will exponentially decrease with linearly-relaxed delay bound, and besides, it is virtually very close to the optimum. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Secondly, four heuristic methods are presented based on specific scheduling rules and energy consumption cost criteria features. Thirdly, an effective iterative greedy algorithm based on Q-learning (Q_PIG) is proposed. In the Q_PIG, a family ordering rule is proposed to exchange with families in other factories to explore better quality solutions during the local search. Moreover, a Q-learning algorithm is embedded to select operations (family operations or job operations) for the current solution.

	abstract = {The distributed hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (DHFSP), which integrates distributed manufacturing models with parallel machines, has gained significant attention. However, in actual scheduling, some adjacent machines do not have buffers between them, resulting in blocking. This paper focuses on addressing the DHFSP with blocking constraints (DBHFSP) based on the actual production conditions. To solve DBHFSP, we construct a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for DBHFSP and validate its correctness using the Gurobi solver. Then, an advanced iterated greedy (AIG) algorithm is designed to minimize the makespan, in which we modify the Nawaz, Enscore, and Ham (NEH) heuristic to solve blocking constraints. To balance the global and local search capabilities of AIG, two effective inter-factory neighborhood search strategies and a swap-based local search strategy are designed. Additionally, each factory is mutually independent, and the movement within one factory does not affect the others. In view of this, we specifically designed a memory-based decoding method for insertion operations to reduce the computation time of the objective. Finally, two shaking strategies are incorporated into the algorithm to mitigate premature convergence. Five advanced algorithms are used to conduct comparative experiments with AIG on 80 test instances, and experimental results illustrate that the makespan and the relative percentage increase (RPI) obtained by AIG are 1.0% and 86.1% respectively, better than the comparative algorithms.  © 2021 TUP.},

This study brings several contributions to the WSP such as a dedicated local search and two metaheuristics: a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search procedure and an Iterated Local Search. Results are performed on theoretical instances, and on a realistic instance of Port-au-Prince city in Haïti after the 2010 earthquake, where the problem has 16,660 vertices and 19,866 routes representing the urban network, and more than 500 blocked roads. The method developed improved the results from the literature and the results indicate its robustness. Moreover, the best-known results for the case of the Haïti instances are presented in this study. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {The manufacturing of composite materials for the aerospace industry represents a cornerstone of future development in this advanced field. In this study, a mathematical model of flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP) was established by extracting the key manufacturing information from an aerospace composite manufacturing workshop. Intelligent algorithms can effectively solve FJSP. However, when applied to a multi-objective FJSP (MOFJSP), they suffer from drawbacks such as blind search and low efficiency. Therefore, this study proposes a new artificial bee colony algorithm and implements it as part of a hybrid method (referred to as the HMABC) to solve MOFJSP. The method involves three steps: (1) A multiple-rule initial population is constructed to minimize randomness and improve quality. (2) A greedy decoding method is used to decode each individual to further narrow the search range to replace the conventional decoding method. (3) By considering the machine load index (which has often been neglected), the concept of machine load rate is proposed, and three heuristic strategies are designed (with the influences ranging from small to high) to diverge the solution in all directions instead of just a direction. The performance of the proposed method is compared with those of existing algorithms using a classical FJSP test example, and the effectiveness and efficiency of HMABC is verified. Finally, the method is applied to an actual aerospace composite manufacturing system to realize the scheduling of actual production activities. © 2022},

	abstract = {Due to its practicality, hybrid flowshop scheduling problem (HFSP) with productivity objective has been extensively explored. However, studies on HFSP considering green objective in distributed production environment are quite limited. Moreover, the current manufacturing mode is gradually evolving toward distributed co-production mode. Thus, this paper investigated a distributed hybrid flowshop scheduling problem (DHFSP) with objectives of minimization the makespan and total energy consumption (TEC). To address this problem, this paper designed a Pareto-based multi-objective hybrid iterated greedy algorithm (MOHIG) by integrating the merits of genetic operator and iterated greedy heuristic. In this MOHIG, firstly, one cooperative initialization strategy is proposed to boost initial solutions’ quality based on the previous experience and rules. Secondly, one knowledge-based multi-objective local search method is invented to enhance the exploitation capability according to characteristics of problem. Thirdly, an energy-saving technique is developed to decrease the idle energy consumption of machine tools. Furthermore, the effectiveness of each improvement component of MOHIG is assessed by three common indicators. Finally, the proposed MOHIG algorithm is compared with other multi-objective optimization algorithms, including SPEA2, MOEA/D, and NSGAII. Experimental results indicate that the proposed MOHIG outperforms its compared algorithms in solving this problem. In addition, this research can better guide practical production in some certain environments. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The significant increase in large-scale wildfire events in recent decades, caused primarily by climate change, has resulted in a growing number of aerial resources being used in suppression efforts. Present-day management lacks efficient and scalable algorithms for complex aerial resource allocation and scheduling for the extinction of such fires, which is crucial to ensuring safety while maximizing the efficiency of operations. In this work, we present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization model tailored to large-scale wildfires for the daily scheduling of aerial operations. The main objective is to achieve a prioritized target water flow over all areas of operation and all time periods. Minimal target completion across individual areas and time periods and total water output are also maximized as secondary and ternary objectives, respectively. An efficient and scalable multi-start heuristic, combining a randomized greedy approach with simulated annealing employing large neighborhood search techniques, is proposed for larger instances. A diverse set of problem instances is generated with varying sizes and extinction strategies to test the approaches. Results indicate that the heuristic can achieve (near)-optimal solutions for smaller instances solvable by the MILP, and gives solutions approaching target water flows for larger problem sizes. The algorithm is parallelizable and has been shown to give promising results in a small number of iterations, making it applicable for both night-before planning and, more time-sensitive, early-morning scheduling. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Permutation flow shop scheduling problem (PFSP) is a well-known NP-hard problem with extensive engineering relevance. Consequently, various meta-heuristics have been proposed to obtain near optimum solutions. However, most of them involve tuning algorithm-specific parameters, which leads to excessive computational complexities. A recently developed meta-heuristic named Jaya algorithm is simple yet efficient as it is a parameter-less algorithm, thus does not require tuning of algorithm-specific parameters. However, as the problem size grows, Jaya algorithm loose solution diversity and tends to get trapped at local optima. To alleviate such drawbacks while retaining the parameter-less feature of Jaya, the present paper proposes a Hybrid Iterated Greedy based Jaya algorithm (HIGJ). The proposed approach combines a novel integration of Jaya’s population-based optimization with the single solutionbased iterated greedy algorithm for enhancing population members to retrieve improved solutions. The objective is to minimize the makespan. The destruction and construction phase of Iterated Greedy (IG) is embedded into the best solution of Jaya algorithm. Furthermore, the local search method is incorporated to improve the overall quality of candidate solutions resulting in faster convergence towards the optimal solution. An exhaustive comparative study along with statistical analysis is conducted with public benchmarks to realize the effectiveness of the proposed HIGJ algorithm. Computational results reveal that HIGJ yields improved solutions and outperforms some of the efficient meta-heuristics available in the literature. © (2024), (American Institute of Mathematical Sciences).

We formulate the problem as an optimization problem. Based on the mathematical description of the optimization problem, we introduce three heuristic approaches and a deep reinforcement learning approach to solve the problem. We define an objective to maximize the ratio of delay-satisfied requests while minimizing the average resource cost for a dynamic scenario. Our introduced two greedy approaches are named finish time greedy and computational resource greedy, respectively. In the finish time greedy approach, we make each request be finished as soon as possible despite its resource cost; in the computational resource greedy approach, we make each request occupy as few resources as possible despite its finish time. Our introduced simulated annealing approach generates feasible solutions randomly and converges to an approximate solution. In our learning-based approach, neural networks are trained to make decisions. We use a simulated environment to evaluate the performances of our introduced approaches. Numerical results show that the introduced deep reinforcement learning approach has the best performance in terms of benefit in our examined cases. © 2023 Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication, Engineers, IEICE.

	abstract = {Software-defined satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (SDSTNs) are seen as a promising paradigm for achieving high resource flexibility and global communication coverage. However, low latency service provisioning is still challenging due to the fast variation of network topology and limited onboard resource at low earth orbit satellites. To address this issue, we study service provisioning in SDSTNs via joint optimization of virtual network function (VNF) placement and routing planning with network dynamics characterized by a time-evolving graph. Aiming at minimizing average service latency, the corresponding problem is formulated as an integer nonlinear programming under resource, VNF deployment, and time-slotted flow constraints. Since exhaustive search is intractable, we transform the primary problem into an integer linear programming by involving auxiliary variables and then propose a Benders decomposition based branch-and-cut (BDBC) algorithm. Towards practical use, a time expansion-based decoupled greedy (TEDG) algorithm is further designed with rigorous complexity analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the optimality of BDBC algorithm and the low complexity of TEDG algorithm. Meanwhile, it is indicated that they can improve the number of completed services within a configuration period by up to 58% and reduce the average service latency by up to 17% compared to baseline schemes.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the domain of just-in-time permutation flowshop scheduling, most studies typically assume that all jobs either have their own soft due date or none of them do. However, in practice, scheduling a combination of hard and soft due date jobs, particularly with the context of emergency order insertion, remains a significant research topic. This paper addresses a constrained permutation flowshop scheduling problem with a mix of hard and soft due date jobs under total weighted tardiness criterion (CPFSP-TWT). We establish a mathematical model and propose an effective Two-Stage Iterated Greedy (ETSIG) algorithm tailored to the problem's characteristics, incorporating a two-stage constructive heuristic to generate a high-quality initial solution. We introduce problem-specific acceleration mechanisms based on position-bound considerations to enhance operational efficiency. We propose three knowledge-based repair strategies for handling infeasible solutions, along with a dynamic self-adjustment mechanism. Additionally, three efficient local search procedures integrate several specific perturbation operators to balance algorithmic exploitation and exploration abilities. Experimental evaluations affirm ETSIG's superiority over five state-of-the-art metaheuristics from closely related literature, establishing its efficacy in addressing CPFSP-TWT. © 2024},

	abstract = {Ports are striving to improve operational efficiency in the context of constantly growing volumes of trade. In this context, port terminal storage yard operation is key, since complexity and poor coordination lead to containers stacked without consideration of retrieval schedules, resulting in time- and energy-consuming reshuffling operations. This problem, known as the block relocation (and retrieval) problem (BRP), has recently gained considerable attention. Indeed, there are promising solutions to the BRP. However, the literature views the problem in isolation, optimizing one operational parameter for one of the many port stakeholders. This often leads to efficiency losses since port processes involve different stakeholders and port parts. In this work, we explicitly focus on scheduling trucks for pick-up for hinterland distribution. Appointments are often postponed in order to minimize reshuffling operations, leading to losses for the transport forwarders and decreasing the competitiveness of the port. We discuss the trade-off between minimizing container reshuffling operations while maintaining scheduled time windows for container retrieval. We describe the multi-objective optimization problem as a weighted sum of the two objectives. Given the complexity of the problem, we also present a greedy heuristic. Our results indicate that the number of schedule deviations can be reduced without significantly affecting the number of relocations compared to solutions that consider only the latter. Ideally, a weighting of 0.4 and 0.6 should be applied, reflecting schedule deviations and relocations, respectively, to achieve the highest joint optimization potential. This demonstrates that in complex environments, such as ports, with multiple interacting stakeholders and processes, coordination of solutions yields significant benefits.  © 2020 IEEE.},

This paper addresses predictive–reactive scheduling, considering parallel batch processor lot-sizing and scheduling with sequence-dependent setup times in a dynamic environment. We propose a predictive scheduling algorithm named S-AGAIG to balance machine spindle utilization and order tardiness in steps. Multiple splitting solutions are first formed by using a split heuristic algorithm to size the sub-lots of orders. Then the adaptive genetic algorithm with iterated greedy search is applied to select the solutions and scheduling. Furthermore, we present a schedule repair strategy based on sub-lot co-processing considering the impact of critical sub-lots, and construct a scheduling stability metric for rescheduling. In 36 sets of case experiments encompassing diverse load and machine type configurations, S-AGAIG showcases a 21.27% enhancement in average tardiness performance when compared to its closest rival.

	abstract = {In recent decades, research on supply chain management (SCM) has enabled companies to improve their environmental, social, and economic performance. This paper presents an industrial application of logistics that can be classified as an inventory-route problem. The problem consists of assigning orders to the available warehouses. The orders are composed of items that must be loaded within a week. The warehouses provide an inventory of the number of items available for each day of the week, so the objective is to minimize the total transportation costs and the costs of producing extra stock to satisfy the weekly demand. To solve this problem a formal mathematical model is proposed. Then a hybrid approach that involves two metaheuristics: a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) and a genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed. Additionally, a meta-learning tuning method is incorporated into our hybridized approach, which yields better results but with a longer computation time. Thus, the trade-off of using it is analyzed. An extensive evaluation was carried out over realistic instances provided by an industrial partner. The proposed technique was evaluated and compared with several complete and incomplete solvers from the state of the art (CP Optimizer, Yuck, OR-Tools, etc.). The results showed that our hybrid metaheuristic outperformed the behavior of these well-known solvers, mainly in large-scale instances (2000 orders per week). This hybrid algorithm provides the company with a powerful tool to solve its supply chain management problem, delivering significant economic benefits every week. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Master Surgery Scheduling Problem (MSSP) can be described as a timetabling problem involving assigning surgery groups to operating theatre (OT) time slots. Previous MSSP optimization models considered throughput, waiting measures, resource utilization, costs, and schedule assignment objectives, but have overlooked consecutive days assignment preferences and surgical equipment-sharing limitations. Furthermore, previous works utilize greedy constructive heuristics to produce solutions, which increases quality but decreases feasibility. Our prior study demonstrated that the saturation degree heuristic enhances feasibility by considering assignment difficulty during event selection. However, its impact on solution quality remained unexplored. Therefore, this study proposes an improved saturation degree-based constructive heuristic that integrates objective function value for event selection to increase both quality and feasibility. The algorithm sorts surgery groups by unit scores, prioritizing higher assignment difficulty and objective value. The highest-scoring group is assigned to its feasible slot with the highest slot score. If no feasible slots exist, the repair mechanism vacates the slot with the highest swap score, which prioritizes lower assignment difficulty and objective value. A new mathematical model is also formulated, incorporating novel objectives regarding consecutive days assignment preference and surgical equipment-sharing limitations. Using real-world data from Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz, the proposed algorithm is evaluated considering repair mechanism usage for feasibility and objective function value for quality. The algorithm is benchmarked against greedy, random, regret-based, and saturation degree-based constructive heuristics. Our algorithm achieved a 14.63% improvement in feasibility compared to the original variant. Its objective function value is over two times better than the closest competitor and 2.6 times superior to the original variant. Comparison with the hospital's actual plan demonstrates competitive objective function value and a more balanced waiting time distribution among surgical groups. Our study showcases that a saturation degree-based constructive heuristic considering objective function value has increased solution quality while maintaining feasibility. © 2013 IEEE.},

This is a challenging task when planning deployments, as sensing and data processing consumes sensor energy. Redundant sensors can help extend the lifetime, but also require good placement and scheduling to be effective. This paper seeks to design a placement scheme and schedule that can achieve near-optimal network lifetime, while satisfying the target coverage constraint. The problem is approached in two phases. The first phase places sensors to maximize K-coverage, a metric closely related to lifetime, using a novel heuristic called Greedy Intersecting Arc Selection. The second phase schedules the nodes’ operations for maximum lifetime, using Memetic Set Scheduler, a novel memetic algorithm. Experimental results show notable improvements in both solution quality and running time for the proposed approach compared to two existing approaches to the problem. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this research is to study the Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained Multi-Project Scheduling Problem (MSRCMPSP), where (1) durations of activities depend on the familiarity levels of assigned workers, (2) more efficient workers demand higher per-day salaries, (3) projects have different due dates and (4) the budget of each period varies over time. The proposed model is bi-objective, and its objectives are minimization of completion times and costs of all projects, simultaneously. Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes a two-phase approach based on the Statistical Process Control (SPC) to solve this problem. This approach aims to develop a control chart so as to monitor the performance of an optimizer during the optimization process. In the first phase, a multi-objective statistical model has been used to obtain control limits of this chart. To solve this model, a Multi-Objective Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (MOGRASP) has been hired. In the second phase, the MSRCMPSP is solved via a New Version of the Multi-Objective Variable Neighborhood Search Algorithm (NV-MOVNS). In each iteration, the developed control chart monitors the performance of the NV-MOVNS to obtain proper solutions. When the control chart warns about an out-of control state, a new procedure based on the Conway’s Game of Life, which is a cellular automaton, is used to bring the algorithm back to the in-control state. Findings: The proposed two-phase approach has been used in solving several standard test problems available in the literature. The results are compared with the outputs of some other methods to assess the efficiency of this approach. Comparisons imply the high efficiency of the proposed approach in solving test problems with different sizes. Practical implications: The proposed model and approach have been used to schedule multiple projects of a construction company in Iran. The outputs show that both the model and the NV-MOVNS can be used in real-world multi-project scheduling problems. Originality/value: Due to the numerous numbers of studies reviewed in this research, the authors discovered that there are few researches on the multi-skill resource-constrained multi-project scheduling problem (MSRCMPSP) with the aforementioned characteristics. Moreover, none of the previous researches proposed an SPC-based solution approach for meta-heuristics in order to solve the MSRCMPSP. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In today's complex business environment, the optimisation of operational processes is an essential factor for the survival of organisations. Many companies struggling to maintain competitiveness search for better operational methods and models to minimise costs and improve market service levels. In these companies, the coordination between manufacturing and logistics activities is critical. The integration and synchronisation of these activities are alternatives that companies require to improve their operational performance and, consequently, increase customer service levels. This article contributes to this approach by proposing and evaluating new heuristic methods to solve the problem of scheduling production and distribution operations in no-wait flow shop systems integrated with transportation systems which operate with different distribution strategies. Based on the assumption that the improvement in synchronisation and coordination of production and transportation operations minimises delivery times and increases service levels, we propose and evaluate heuristic methods for the problem. These heuristic methods implement scheduling algorithmic structures based on the iterated greedy (IG), iterated local search, simulated annealing (SA), and variable neighbourhood search metaheuristics, which jointly schedule manufacturing and transportation operations. In this context, the decision level is operational. The minimum total flow time is the main optimisation criterion. The problem studied herein is inspired on the real-life case of an electronic goods company. The analysis of the experimental results demonstrates the potential of these methods to solve the problem of different models of transportation. Specifically, the IGSA2 method obtained the best results, improving the quality of the initial solutions by up to 17% in small, medium, and large instances depending on the adopted initialisation heuristic. The best proposed algorithm IGSA2 was compared with the two state-of-the-art algorithms to obtain superior results. The study also verified a proposed hypothesis to improve the quality of the solutions generated using heuristic methods, which was proved to be true for most of the experiments. © 2022},

	abstract = {The development of AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things) and communication technologies has recently brought with it many promising applications. Intelligent surveillance is one of the new models of applications that synthesizes both technologies of IoTs and the object recognition method of artificial intelligence. However, this system suffers from the heavy computation load problem, but the processing devices are generally lightweight with only limited memory and computation power. In this paper, we propose a cooperative image object recognition framework to integrate the process of AIoT devices into the edge computing environment to overcome this problem. The proposed scheme offloads some captured surveillance video frames to nearby GPU equipped edge servers and then integrates the returned results to enhance the overall recognition accuracy of the surveillance system. We also formulate the AIoT Task Offloading scheduling to a mathematical programming Problem (named ATOP) and prove it to be an NP-complete problem. A heuristic Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is also proposed to determine near optimal offloading scheduling for the ATOP such that the overall object recognition precision is maximized. Although the object recognition precision is enhanced, there still remains a gap to the ground truth, and the cumulative gap might cause significant errors as times goes by. In this research, we also develop a mechanism to help the designer to automatically diagnose when the cumulative errors become significant. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework is feasible and the proposed Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for the ATOP outperforms the greedy approach and the genetic algorithm. The simulation results also show that the abnormal data diagnosis mechanism can figure out when the cumulative errors happen using a real-world human-flow counting data set. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The mathematical model is created without simplifications, using the real calendar, including holidays. This precludes the possibility of cyclic-type solutions, and involves numerous and varied constraints (demand, workload, ergonomics, fairness, etc.). An effective solution to this very difficult practical problem cannot be obtained, for large instances, with exact solution methods. We formulate a mathematical representation of a real-world ER physician scheduling problem featuring a hybrid algorithm combining continuous linear programming with a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP). Linear programming is used to model a general physician-demand covering problem, where the solution is used to guide the construction phase of the GRASP, to obtain initial full schedules for subsequent improvement by iterative application of Variable Neighborhood Descent Search (VNDS) and Network Flow Optimization (NFO). A computational study shows the superiority of our approach over the Integer Linear Programming method in a set of instances of varying size and difficulty inspired by a real setting. The methodology is embedded in a software tool for generating one-year-ahead physician schedules for a local ER. These solutions, which are now in use, outperform the manually-created schedules used previously. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the loading operations of a new type of quay crane, the tandem quay crane (TQC), which has been designed to increase the terminal productivity by lifting more containers simultaneously. Due to the special characteristics of the TQC, more than one truck is required to serve a tandem-lift of it, and the containers handled in a tandem-lift must be loaded into two neighboring rows in the same tier of the containership. Of particular importance in schedules at the terminal is to coordinate the truck scheduling and container stowage slot plan with the TQCs, which is a key challenge in practice. This paper is an attempt to tackle this issue by developing a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model with an objective of minimizing the completion time of the loading operation under the full utilization of the TQC. Due to the complexity of the MILP model, we then propose a model to derive lower bounds of the problem, and a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) to solve the problem. Computational experiments are conducted with a variety of instances. The results derived by GRASP for solving small size problems are within 0.04% of the optimal results obtained by the Gurobi. For large scale instances, GRASP outperforms the Gurobi in terms of the solution quality and computation time. Additionally, on average results derived by GRASP are within 8.2% of the lower bound. Further experiments demonstrate the advantage of the integrated optimization of container slot planning and truck scheduling for TQCs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new extension of the multi-skill resource-constrained project scheduling problem: MS-RCPSP with skill switches. In real-world environment, the switch between skills for a resource often incurs considerable extra operation time and cost to meet the requirement of task. A mixed-integer programming model, aiming to minimize project completion time and total cost, is developed. Then, to solve this new problem effectively, we investigate the related existing solution representations and schedule builders from previous literature. Based on the investigation, we propose a new flexible solution representation scheme with reduced search space and a novel greedy-like schedule builder scheme that reorders tasks to reduce skill switches. Besides, we select two efficient mutation operators, i.e., a swap operator and a resource-leveling operator. The swap operator adjusts the task assignment sequence while the resource-leveling operator reassigns the tasks to other resources based on the resource loads of the current schedule. This operator improves solutions by balancing resource loads. We embed all the proposed new components into a multi-objective evolution strategy (MOES) framework. We analyze different configurations of MOES in terms of representation, schedule builder, and mutation operators, and identify the best configuration. We compare the result of MOES with the state-of-the-art algorithms on a wide range of test instances, and the results show that our proposed representation scheme and schedule builder can improve the convergence of the Pareto Front, while the resource-leveling operator can greatly improve the spread and diversity of the front. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the transportation of valuable goods in which security carriers are interested to optimize the operating costs and the vehicle routes’ security. In real operations, route planning and scheduling are normally performed manually based on individual experience. Hereupon, an optimizing approach should be developed to target the robbery risk reduction and the distribution network’ operational costs. Facing the dangerous nature of operations, some considerations play an important role, including demand fluctuations and traffic congestion of the urban environment. To handle these issues, we respectively benefit from the robust optimization theory and considering time-dependent travel speeds with satisfying the “first-in-first-out” property. This paper proposes a rich vehicle routing problem denoted by the secure time-dependent vehicle routing problem with time windows including pickup and delivery with uncertain demands (S-TD-VRPTWPD-UD). A mathematical formulation and an efficient solution approach combining the greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) and the iterated local search (ILS) are developed to minimize the predictability of route plans using an integrated risk index, besides the travel costs. Extensive computational experiments on this problem are performed to analyze the impact of the demand uncertainty and the speed time-dependency and to show the efficiency of the GRASP×ILS implementation. The results show the significant improvements due to the time-dependency as well as the extra cost of protecting the model against the worst-case scenario of demand requests by deriving the robust counterpart of the S-TD-VRPTWPD-UD. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the present study, we proposed a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) for integrated scheduling of dynamic flexible job shops with a novel preventive maintenance policy. In most of the real-life scheduling practices, unexpected and unknown events occur frequently, which necessitates solving operations and maintenance scheduling problems dynamically. Dynamic events like new order arrival, machine breakdown, changes in due date, order cancellation, and urgent order are considered in this study. Moreover, order acceptance/rejection decisions and an order review release mechanism are also taken into account in order to enhance the overall performance by adjusting capacity regarding to customer due date requirements. Four objectives namely mean tardiness, schedule instability, makespan, and mean flow time are considered within a lexicographic programming logic. Random test instances are generated for the stated dynamic scheduling problem. In order to confirm the applicability of the proposed GRASP-based algorithm, extensive experiments were also conducted on well-known job shop scheduling benchmark instances and flexible job shop scheduling benchmark instances with preventive maintenance activities. Computational experiments conducted under various experimental settings such as flexibility level and due date tightness in addition to different preventive maintenance policies. To the best of our knowledge, the present study presents the first attempt through GRASP for simultaneous dynamic scheduling of operations and preventive maintenance activities in flexible job shops. Results of the extensive computational experiments demonstrate that simultaneous scheduling of manufacturing operations and preventive maintenance activities is a viable and effective approach for performance improvement in dynamic flexible job shop scheduling environments. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

However, due to the dynamic nature of real-world applications, activity durations are vulnerable to change. In addition, resource demands along with resource availability at any stage of a project can also vary due to disruptions, which compel practitioners to re-think existing scheduling methodologies. Consequently, to mitigate the conjoint effect of those uncertainties and/or disruptions, this paper proposes a real-time reactive scheduling approach. To deal with uncertain activity durations, a chance constrained based approach is followed, which is later solved by an advanced meta-heuristic based approaches called IGFBIS and IGFBID. After solving an exhaustive list of stochastic RCPSP instances, this paper proves the efficacy of the proposed approaches, which is proven to be more useful to mitigate uncertainty or disruption while executing real-life projects.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Due to the non-uniform geographic distribution and time-varying characteristics of the ground traffic request, how to make full use of the limited beam resources to serve users flexibly and efficiently is a brand-new challenge for beam hopping satellite systems. The conventional greedy-based beam hopping methods do not consider the long-term reward, which is difficult to deal with the time-varying traffic demand. Meanwhile, the heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm have a slow convergence time, which can not achieve real-time scheduling. Furthermore, existing methods based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) only make decisions on beam patterns, lack of the freedom of bandwidth. This paper proposes a dynamic beam pattern and bandwidth allocation scheme based on DRL, which flexibly uses three degrees of freedom of time, space and frequency. Considering that the joint allocation of bandwidth and beam pattern will lead to an explosion of action space, a cooperative multi-agents deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework is presented in this paper, where each agent is only responsible for the illumination allocation or bandwidth allocation of one beam. The agents can learn to collaborate by sharing the same reward to achieve the common goal, which refers to maximize the throughput and minimize the delay fairness between cells. Simulation results demonstrate that the offline trained MADRL model can achieve real-time beam pattern and bandwidth allocation to match the non-uniform and time-varying traffic request. Furthermore, when the traffic demand increases, our model has a good generalization ability.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Mobile vehicles have been considered as potential edge servers to provide computation resources for the emerging Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications. However, how to fully utilize the mobile computation resources to satisfy the real-time arrived computation requests has not been explored yet. This work will address the critical challenges of limited computation resources, stringent computation delay and unknown requirement statistics of real-time tasks in realistic vehicular edge computing scenarios. Specifically, we design a distributed clustering strategy to classify vehicles into multiple cooperative edge servers according to the available computation resources, effective connection time and the distribution of tasks' expected deadlines. Then, a 'Less than or Equal to' Generalized Assignment Problem (i.e., LEGAP) is formulated to maximize the system service revenue, and on this basis, we propose an offline Bound-and-Bound based Optimal (BBO) algorithm to make periodical scheduling with a global view of tasks' requirement statistics. The quick branching is conducted by following a greedy solution and the upper bound at each branch is derived by solving a multiple-choice knapsack problem. In addition, we present an online heuristic algorithm which makes real-time offloading decision with the guarantees that the resource capacities of all the computing servers are never exceeded with new tasks arriving. Through comparing with the other four online algorithms, the BBO algorithm achieves the highest service revenues by offloading tasks with shorter delays, and the online heuristic algorithm has the best performance in improving the service ratios.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Spatial crowdsourcing, a human-centric compelling paradigm in performing spatial tasks, has drawn rising attention. Task assignment is of paramount importance in spatial crowdsourcing. Existing studies often use heuristics of various kinds to solve task assignment problems. These schemes usually only apply some specific cases, once the environment changes, the efficiency of the algorithms is significantly reduced. In this paper, we first introduce a taxonomy of task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing. Next, we design an approximation algorithm and get an efficient solution for the important problem, namely, Bounded and Heterogeneous Task Assignment (BHTA), such that the sum of the rewards of workers is maximized subject to multiple constraints. We prove that the BHTA problem is NP-hard. Subsequently, we propose a constant-ratio approximation algorithm based on partition and shifting method to achieve the assignment solution. To meet with the workers' dynamism, we further devise a greedy algorithm and provide theoretical guarantee. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our strategy over previous methods. So far as we know, this paper is the first attempt to give a constant-ratio approximation for such task assignment problems in spatial crowdsourcing.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this article, we consider the design of dynamic transmission scheduling policies for the industrial network systems sharing scarce communication resources. Only a few subsystems can obtain channel access for information updates to close their control loops at each time step, which highlights the necessity of designing optimal transmission scheduling schemes to achieve a minimum average linear quadratic cost of the industrial network systems. We first propose a greedy state-error-dependent scheduling (SES) policy based on the one-step expected profit and discuss its stability employing the Lyapunov function method. After formulating the scheduling optimization as a Markov decision process problem and relaxing with a soft constraint, we develop a heuristic near-optimal solution that guarantees the optimality of certainty equivalent controllers, namely, Whittle's index-inspired error-dependent scheduling (WIES). A stochastic stability condition of WIES is further given based on f-ergodicity. Due to low computational complexity and ease of implementation, the proposed schemes are suitable for large-scale heterogeneous industrial network systems. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed policies outperform the existing round-robin, holding-time-prioritized, and error-aware scheduling schemes.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The distributed permutation flowshop scheduling problem (DPFSP) has been a hot issue in recent years. Due to the practical relevance of sequence-dependent setup time (SDST), we consider the DPFSP with SDST to minimize makespan. For the purpose, we propose three constructive heuristics and an effective discrete artificial bee colony (DABC) algorithm. All the heuristics are based on a greedy assignment rule and a local search of job blocks in each factory. In the local search, three different setup times are respectively considered for inserting a job block. In the DABC, to balance the local exploitation and the global exploration, we propose six composite neighborhood operators according to the problem characteristics. The first three are based on insertion and swap operators, and the second three have a close relationship with the critical factory. A problem-oriented local search method is developed to improve the best individual in the population. A comprehensive computational campaign against the closely related and state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature shows that both the proposed heuristics and DABC are very effective for solving the problem under consideration. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {To realise the intelligent decision-making of dynamic scheduling and reconfiguration, we studied the intelligent scheduling and reconfiguration with dynamic job arrival for a reconfigurable flow line (RFL) using deep reinforcement learning (DRL), for the first time. The system architecture of intelligent scheduling and reconfiguration in smart manufacturing is proposed, and the mathematical model is established to minimise total tardiness cost. In addition, a DRL system of scheduling and reconfiguration is proposed by designing state features, actions, and rewards for scheduling and reconfiguration agents. Moreover, the advantage actor-critic (A2C) is adapted to solve the studied problem. The training curve shows the A2C-based agents have effectively learned to generate better solutions for unseen instances. The test results show that the A2C-based approach outperforms two traditional meta-heuristics, iterated greedy (IG) and genetic algorithm (GA), in solution quality and CPU times by a large margin. Specifically, the A2C-based approach outperforms IG and GA by 57.43% and 88.30%, using only 0.46‱ and 2.20‱ CPU times of IG and GA. The trained model can generate a scheduling or reconfiguration decision within 1.47 ms, which is almost instantaneous and can satisfy real-time optimisation.

DMFBs can efficiently carry out biochemical analysis and have many advantages over the traditional laboratory system. DMFBs offer miniaturization, automation, and programmability. Resource-constrained scheduling is the first and vital step of fluidic-level synthesis of DMFBs while the other two are placement and routing of droplets. Scheduling DMFB operations is a constrained optimization problem which is NP-Complete. We propose an invasive weed optimization (IWO) algorithm based scheduling for the synthesis of DMFBs. The IWO algorithm is a nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm. Proposed algorithm can be used for the offline synthesis of DMFBs, where solution quality is more important than execution time. Each weed in the proposed algorithm represents a potential candidate solution for the scheduling problem. To calculate the fitness of individual weeds, we proposed an algorithm based on Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT), which incorporates resource binding, scheduling, and greedy module selection mechanism for bio-assay operations. Weeds (solutions) update their positions (priorities) by colonization behavior of weeds. Simulation results show that proposed IWO outperforms iterative improvement based algorithms and optimal ILP based algorithms which are existing for the offline synthesis of DMFBs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

This function will be linearly dependent of these two criteria via a weighting parameter for each criterion.

Second, a series of local operators are added in order to drive the search process around a series of neighborhoods. Third, a first diversification strategy based upon drop and rebuild operators is employed. The second diversification/intensification strategy is used for highlighting the performance of the method; it incorporates a look-ahead strategy combined with the path-relinking. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is experimentally analyzed on a set of benchmark instances of the literature, where its provided results are compared to those achieved by more recent methods available in the literature. Its behavior is also evaluated by providing a statistical analysis using both the Sign test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Fifth generation (5G) new radio introduced flexible numerology to accommodate heterogeneous services. However, optimizing the scheduling of heterogeneous services with differing delay and throughput requirements over 5G new radio is a challenging task. In this paper, we investigate near optimal, low complexity scheduling of radio resources for ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) when coexisting with enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services. We demonstrate that maximizing the sum throughput of eMBB services while servicing URLLC users over a fixed length time-frequency grid, is, in the long-term, equivalent to minimizing the number of URLLC placements in the time-frequency grid; this is the consequence of reducing the number of infeasible placements for eMBB, to which we refer to as 'conflicts.' To meet this new objective, we evaluate the performance of new, conflict-aware heuristics, consisting of a family of 'greedy' and a lightweight heuristic inspired by bin packing optimization, all of near optimal performance. Moreover, having shed light on the impact of conflict in layer-2 scheduling, we investigate non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) as a potential approach for conflict resolution leveraging superposition coding. The superior performance of NOMA with respect to OMA, thanks to resolving conflicts, is showcased by extensive numerical results.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Our objective is to minimize the total weighted delivery time (TWD) after including delivery durations for the jobs. We first analyse several special cases which can be solved to optimality in polynomial time. Based on the gained insights of the analysis, constructive algorithms are proposed for the general problem setting. A greedy randomized adaptive search (GRASP) framework is proposed to guide the subordinate heuristics to further improve algorithm performance for large-sized problem instances. Computational experiments based on randomly generated problem instances are carried out. They demonstrate that the GRASP computes competitive schedules for the special cases.

As the core of manufacturing management, the research into the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) focuses on optimizing scheduling decisions in real time, according to the changes in the production environment.

A double deep Q‐networks (DDQN) architecture is proposed and state features, actions and rewards are designed. A soft ε‐greedy behavior policy is designed according to the scale of the problem. The experimental results show that the proposed DRL is better than other reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, heuristics and metaheuristics in terms of solution quality and generalization. In addition, the soft ε‐greedy strategy reasonably balances exploration and exploitation, thereby improving the learning efficiency of the scheduling agent.

	abstract = {This paper addresses the job shop scheduling problem including time lag constraints. This is an extension of the job shop scheduling problem with many applications in real production environments, where extra (minimum and maximum) delays can be introduced between successive operations of the same job. It belongs to a category of problems known as NP-hard problem due to large solution space. Biogeography-based optimization is an evolutionary algorithm which is inspired by the migration of species between habitats, recently proposed by Simon in 2008 to optimize hard combinatorial optimization problems. We propose a hybrid biogeography-based optimization (HBBO) algorithm for solving the job shop scheduling problem with additional time lag constraints with minimization of total completion time. In the proposed HBBO, the effective greedy constructive heuristic is adapted to generate the initial population of habitat. Moreover, a local search metaheuristic is investigated in the mutation step in order to ameliorate the solution quality and enhance the diversity of the population. To assess the performance of HBBO, a series of experiments on well-known benchmark instances for job shop scheduling problem with time lag constraints is performed. © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Metaheuristic algorithms offer unique opportunities in problem solving. Although they do not guarantee optimality, it has been shown by numerous publications that they can achieve excellent results in acceptable time. Particularly in real-life production systems, which are mostly comprised of complex discrete optimization problems, the merit should be finding appropriate and efficient solutions in shorter periods rather than waiting for the optimum solution in whole shift. Accordingly, this paper presents a learning iterated greedy search metaheuristic to minimize the maximum completion time in a hybrid flexible flowshop problem with sequence dependent setup times encountered at a manufacturing plant. The proposed algorithm is comprised of four main phases. The first phase employs NEH heuristic to generate an initial solution. Additionally, in order to introduce diversity, some replications are occasionally allowed to start with random solutions. Destruction mechanism to perturb the current solution is used in the next phase. It is followed by a construction procedure, which is used to repair the partial solution obtained after destruction. Finally, a descent neighborhood search enhanced by a hyper-heuristic based learning is applied to the repaired solution in the fourth phase. Thus, algorithm adaptively learns and promotes the most efficient low-level heuristic out of a heuristics pool and encourages the metaheuristic algorithm in using the promoted low-level heuristic in the final phase. The proposed algorithm along with its several extensions is tested by using real data taken from the mentioned production system. Next, by making use of the same data, the developed algorithms are also compared to eight different algorithms, which are shown to be promising in the related literature. Finally, appropriate statistical tests are applied to demonstrate possible significant improvements among all tested algorithms. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

To solve the resource allocation and assignment problem over heterogeneous NOMA networks, two subproblems are formulated, i.e., a packet assignment subproblem for video traffic and a joint device allocation and power control subproblem. Firstly, the joint device allocation and power control subproblem is transformed into a bi-convex programming with successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Then, an optimal device allocation and power control solution is obtained via dual decomposition method. Finally, a heuristic packet assignment algorithm via greedy method is presented for video transmission traffic.

	abstract = {Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC) has been envisioned as a potential fog computing paradigm which aims to offload delay sensitive tasks to mobile fog vehicles instead of remote cloud in order to facilitate computational demands of smart villages close to rural highways. There exists challenges related to task offloading in VFC that need to be addressed. Most often, Road Side Units (RSUs) deployed along rural highways are energy constrained and they need to provide energy efficient scheduling services for the allocation of tasks to fog vehicles. On the other hand, energy consumption optimization is challenging, since scheduling decision of local processing of tasks incur computation cost while the allocation of tasks to fog vehicles incurs communication cost. Although the task offloading to VFC reduces response latency, it leads to higher RSU energy consumption contributed by the communication of task data to fog vehicles. Therefore, this paper presents an energy efficient vehicle scheduling problem for offloading of tasks to mobile fog nodes subject to satisfy constraints of task deadline and resource availability. To resolve high dimensionality issue caused by increased number of vehicles in RSU coverage, we propose an on-policy reinforcement leaning based scheduling algorithm combined with fuzzy logic based greedy heuristic, named as Fuzzy Reinforcement Learning (FRL). This greedy heuristic not only accelerates learning process, but also improves long term reward when compared to Q-learning algorithm. Extensive experiments have been performed to evaluate the proposed algorithm and the simulation results show that the proposed FRL algorithm outperforms other scheduling algorithms such as First Come First Serve (FCFS), Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS), Fuzzy and Distributed Task Allocation with Distributed Process (DTA_DP). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

Considering the development of the AGVEESR, we extract problem-specific knowledge, establish a multiobjective mathematical model, and design a hybrid constructive heuristic. Due to the complexity of the problem, we propose an efficient multiobjective greedy algorithm (MOGA) with effective strategies such as new population initialization, greedy operation, and self-adaptive multiple neighbourhood local search.

	abstract = {The Quantum Circuit Compilation Problem (QCCP) is challenging to the Artificial Intelligence community. It was already tackled with temporal planning, constraint programming, greedy heuristics and other techniques. In this paper, QCCP is formulated as a scheduling problem and solved by a genetic algorithm. We focus on QCCP for Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithms (QAOA) applied to the MaxCut problem and consider Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware architectures. Based on the fact that these algorithms apply a set of basic quantum operations repeatedly over a number of rounds, we propose a genetic algorithm approach, termed Decomposition Based Genetic Algorithm (DBGA), that in each round extends the partial solutions obtained for the previous ones. DBGA is compared to the state of the art across a set of conventional instances. The results of the experimental study provided interesting insight in the problem structure and showed that DBGA is quite competitive with the state of the art. In particular, DBGA outperformed the best current method on the largest instances and provided new best solutions to most of them. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Owing to the spectrum scarcity and energy constrained devices in wireless networks arises the demand for an efficient spectrum sensing technique which improves both sensing performance and energy efficiency for cognitive radio networks. This paper proposes a cooperative spectrum sensing scheduling (CSSS) scheme for heterogeneous multi-channel cognitive radio networks with the objective of finding an efficient sensing schedule to enhance network utility while keeping the energy depletion at a lower level. We start with formulating the CSSS problem as an optimization problem, which captures both the energy-performance and performance opportunity trade-offs. We prove that the formulated CSSS problem is non-deterministic polynomial hard (NP-hard). To tackle the higher computational complexity of the formulated problem, we propose a greedy-based heuristic solution, which produces a sub-optimal result in polynomial time. To reduce energy consumption during spectrum sensing, we make secondary users to adaptively decide on the sensing duration based on the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), where higher SNR leads to lower sensing duration and vice-versa. For enhancing network throughput, SUs sense multiple channels in the order of their suitability for data transmission to explore as many numbers of channels as possible within the permitted maximum sensing time. We consider erroneous nature of reporting channel to make the cooperative decision robust against errors during reporting. Simulation based results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of utility, energy overhead, and the number of channels explored compared to similar schemes from literature. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Distributed permutation flow-shop scheduling problem (DPFSP) has achieved much attention in recent years, which always assumes that there are infinite buffers between any consecutive machines. However, in many practical industrials, no buffers exist between some consecutive machines due to space constraint or technological requirement, which generate various types of blocking constraint. Hence, a distributed mixed permutation blocking flow-shop scheduling problem (DMBPFSP) is investigated in this paper, which considers three types of blocking constraint and without blocking. The objective is to minimize the maximum makespan among all factories. To address this problem, an improved NEH heuristic (NEH_P) is proposed, which incorporates the re-optimization of partial solutions. Afterwards, an efficient iterated greedy (EIG) algorithm is proposed. In the proposed EIG, the NEH_P heuristic is employed to generate the initial solution with high quality. A problem-specific knowledge based destruction–construction is used to explore the solution space. Three efficient local search procedures are designed to implement exploitation around the critical factory and exploitation across multi-factory. We compare the proposed methods against the closely relevant and high-performing methods in the literature. The computational results indicate that both NEH_P and EIG are very effective for addressing the considered problem. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Production scheduling plays a pivotal role in successfully executing any open-pit mining operation. It defines the most profitable extraction sequence of mineralized material from the ground subject to various physical and operational constraints. Different mathematical formulations have been proposed to achieve this goal; however, solving these models for real-sized deposits with multiple constraints is a challenging and computationally expensive task. Moreover, the inclusion of stockpiling option further complicates this task. The stockpile option adds flexibility to the operation by allowing excess low-grade ore storage for processing at a later stage when processing capacity is available. Accurate integration of stockpiling option in the production scheduling process through mathematical approaches leads to nonlinear constraints. This could further complicate the already challenging task since linear approximation of these nonlinear constraints could lead to sub-optimal results. Metaheuristic techniques could play an essential role in handling such situations. Though several attempts have been made to solve this problem through these techniques, little effort has been made to incorporate stockpiling option in the optimization process. This article presents a Simulated Annealing based approach for production scheduling of open-pit mines with stockpiling option. The proposed approach uses a stockpile and a greedy heuristic with a Simulated Annealing algorithm to achieve this goal. The greedy heuristic improves the Simulated Annealing algorithm's computational efficiency by managing its randomness. The proposed approach's performance and efficiency are demonstrated through three case studies (A, B, and C) under different algorithmic settings. Results of these case studies reveals that compared with the CPLEX solver, the proposed approach produced near optimal solution, within reasonable amount of time, proving the applicability of the proposed approach. © 2021},

	abstract = {The widespread deployment of scientific applications and business services of various types on clouds requires the transfer of big data with different priorities between geographically distributed cloud-based data centers. As a result, Cloud Service Providers (CSP) face a significant challenge to fully utilize the expensive bandwidth resources of the links connecting data centers while guaranteeing Quality of Experience (QoE) for users. Modern data centers are increasingly adopting Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technology, which provides the capability of advance bandwidth reservation. This paper focuses on the collaborative scheduling of multiple prioritized user requests, namely, advance bandwidth reservation with a lower priority and immediate bandwidth reservation with a higher priority, to maximize the total user satisfaction. We formulate this co-scheduling problem with preemption as a generic optimization problem, which is shown to be NP-complete. We design a heuristic algorithm to maximize the number of successfully scheduled requests and minimize the number of preempted advance reservation requests, while minimizing the completion time of each request. Extensive results from simulations with randomly generated networks and emulation-based experiments on an SDN testbed show that our scheduling scheme significantly outperforms greedy approaches in terms of user satisfaction degree, a normalized quantification parameter we define to measure users’ QoE. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Energy consumption minimization of cloud data centers (DCs) has attracted much attention from the research community in the recent years; particularly due to the increasing dependence of emerging Cyber-Physical Systems on them. An effective way to improve the energy efficiency of DCs is by using efficient job scheduling strategies. However, the most challenging issue in selection of efficient job scheduling strategy is to ensure service-level agreement (SLA) bindings of the scheduled tasks. Hence, an energy-aware and SLA-driven job scheduling framework based on MapReduce is presented in this article. The primary aim of the proposed framework is to explore task-to-slot/container mapping problem as a special case of energy-aware scheduling in deadline-constrained scenario. Thus, this problem can be viewed as a complex multi-objective problem comprised of different constraints. To address this problem efficiently, it is segregated into three major subproblems (SPs), namely, deadline segregation, map and reduce phase energy-aware scheduling. These SPs are individually formulated using Integer Linear Programming. To solve these SPs effectively, heuristics based on Greedy strategy along with classical Hungarian algorithm for serial and serial-parallel systems are used. Moreover, the proposed scheme also explores the potential of splitting Map/Reduce phase(s) into multiple stages to achieve higher energy reductions. This is achieved by leveraging the concepts of classical Greedy approach and priority queues. The proposed scheme has been validated using real-time data traces acquired from OpenCloud. Moreover, the performance of the proposed scheme is compared with the existing schemes using different evaluation metrics, namely, number of stages, total energy consumption, total makespan, and SLA violated. The results obtained prove the efficacy of the proposed scheme in comparison to the other schemes under different workload scenarios. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {In recent years, more and more large-scale data processing and computing workflow applications run on heterogeneous clouds. Such cloud applications with precedence-constrained tasks are usually deadline-constrained and their scheduling is an essential problem faced by cloud providers. Moreover, minimizing the workflow execution cost based on cloud billing periods is also a complex and challenging problem for clouds. In realizing this, we first model the workflow applications as I/O Data-aware Directed Acyclic Graph (DDAG), according to clouds with global storage systems. Then, we mathematically state this deadline-constrained workflow scheduling problem with the goal of minimum execution financial cost. We also prove that the time complexity of this problem is NP-hard by deducing from a multidimensional multiple-choice knapsack problem. Third, we propose a heuristic cost-efficient task scheduling strategy called CETSS, which includes workflow DDAG model building, task subdeadline initialization, greedy workflow scheduling algorithm, and task adjusting method. The greedy workflow scheduling algorithm mainly consists of dynamical task renting billing period sharing method and unscheduled task subdeadline relax technique. We perform rigorous simulations on some synthetic randomly generated applications and real-world applications, such as Epigenomics, CyberShake, and LIGO. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that our proposed heuristic CETSS outperforms the existing algorithms and can effective save the total workflow execution cost. In particular, CETSS is very suitable for large workflow applications.  © 1990-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new problem in the field of production planning, called the production leveling problem. The task is to assign orders to production periods such that the load in each period and for each product type is balanced, capacity limits are not exceeded, and the orders’ priorities are taken into account. Production leveling is an important intermediate step between long-term planning and the final scheduling of orders within a production period, as it is responsible for selecting good subsets of orders to be scheduled within each period. We provide a formal model of the problem and study its computational complexity. As an exact method for solving moderately sized instances, we introduce a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation. For solving large problem instances, metaheuristic local search is investigated. A greedy heuristic and two neighborhood structures for local search are proposed in order to apply them using simulated annealing. Furthermore, three possible extensions that arise from the application in practice are described and implemented, both within the MIP model and within simulated annealing. We make publicly available a set of realistic problem instances from the industry as well as from random instance generators. The experimental evaluation on our test sets shows that the proposed MIP model is well suited for solving instances with up to 250 orders. Simulated annealing produces solutions with less than 3 % average optimality gap on small instances, and scales well up to thousands of orders and dozens of periods and product types. The metaheuristic method presented herein is already being successfully used in the industry. © 2022, The Author(s).},

The DPUC is an important application problem in modern electronics manufacturing. A robust model is established for the DPUC with makespan criterion. A counter-intuitive paradox is found, that is, adding a new job to one of the production lines can reduce the completion time of the production line. Two acceleration methods are provided to save computational efforts. An iterated greedy algorithm called IG_FS is proposed to solve the DPUC. A heuristic based on the well-known NEH is proposed to generate the initial solution for the IG_FS. In the destruction phase of the IG_FS, dynamic sizes based on both adaptability and randomness are provided to improve the exploration capability. During the local search phase of the IG_FS, a hybrid local search method consisting of shift and swap operators is presented to exploit more diverse search areas.

	abstract = {Scheduling is an important decision-making process for manufacturing companies. Shop scheduling is a subsection of scheduling related to manufacturing shops. The job shop scheduling problem (JSP) aims to minimize the makespan of a product value of the production process. This issue is related to optimizing the sequence of the jobs on appropriate machines. With globalization, manufacturing shops are scattered around the world. The distributed job shop scheduling problem (DJSP) tries to solve the optimizing sequence on these scattered facilities. DJSP is more complex than JSP. DJSP is solved by exact and heuristic solvers. Exact solvers more time-consuming processes for huge problems. In this work, a discrete version of the spotted hyena optimizer (DSHO) is proposed for solving DJSP. A workload-based facility order mechanism and a greedy heuristic approach are combined with the DSHO algorithm. 80 distributed job shop scheduling problems (DJSP) are solved by DSHO. For evaluating the performance of the DSHO, numerical results of the 480 (2 facilities to 7 facilities) large instances that are derived from well-known JSP benchmarks are compared with four different discrete meta-heuristic algorithms. The experimental results are shown that DSHO is a pioneer solver for DJSP. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In this work, the travel path of a set of drones is scheduled across a graph, where the nodes need to be visited multiple times at pre-defined points in time. The nodes can either be demand nodes requesting monitoring, or supply nodes that are used as take-off/landing locations for the drones and for battery replacement to cope with the limited flying range of the drones. This is an extension of the well-known multiple traveling salesman problem and the proposed formulation can be applied in several domains such as the monitoring of traffic flows in a transportation network, the monitoring of remote locations to assist search and rescue missions, or the monitoring of critical infrastructure facilities for security and surveillance purposes. Aiming to find the optimal schedule, the problem is initially formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). However, given that the problem is highly combinatorial, the optimal solution scales only for small-size problems. Thus, a greedy algorithm is also proposed that uses a one-step look-ahead heuristic search mechanism, as well as an algorithm that is based on ant colony optimization (ACO). In a detailed evaluation, it is observed that both algorithms achieve near-optimal performance for small settings, while also scaling to larger settings, with the ACO being more suitable for medium-size settings and the Greedy for larger ones. A field experiment is additionally performed to demonstrate the practical implementation of the proposed system under real-world conditions.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The rapid development of self-driving cars and breakthroughs in key technologies have made the truck platoon possible. In addition to reducing truck fuel consumption and air pollution by reducing air resistance, effective platoon strategies can also maximize highway throughput while improving driving safety. However, the truck platoon strategy's current resource allocation model is still in the preliminary research stage. Therefore, inspired by the successful experience of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in solving resource allocation problems, this article proposes a dynamic resource allocation model for the truck platoon based on the semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) and DRL, which is used to maximize system revenue when considering the resource cost and income balance of the transportation system. Precisely, the proposed method first models the process of controlling the dynamic in and out of the truck platoon as SMDP. The action value in a specific state obtained by the planning algorithm is used as a DRL sample for model training. Finally, the SMDP is optimized through the trained model to obtain a truck platoon resource that approximates the optimal strategy distribution plan. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional greedy algorithm, value iteration, and Q-learning scheme concerning solving the dynamic resource allocation model of the truck platoon, the Deep Q-Network (DQN) used in this article can reduce the probability of request processing delay while causing the system to obtain higher rewards.  © 2014 IEEE.},

We propose a novel scalable video coding (SVC)-based two-tier cooperative caching strategy that can provide video services with different perceptual qualities. In addition, we propose a hierarchical hybrid transmission scheme where users obtain the requested layer files through the cooperative cellular multicast-D2D and THz transmissions. A base layer-based multicast group aggregation process is presented to improve resource utilization, while an efficient multicast transmission resource scheduling scheme can make better use of the spatial reusability. We derive the expressions for the average offloading capacity gain and average energy consumption, and formulate an efficiency function optimization problem. The problem is efficiently solved by the greedy strategy-gradient descent based caching solution and long tail distribution based heuristic caching solution. Simulation results validate the two solutions and demonstrate that the proposed caching-transmission method can achieve quasi-optimal performance compared with other contrasting schemes.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

In the problem considered in this paper, the decision of patient assignment must be made immediately when the patient request arrives. Once patients have been accepted, they are serviced at the same days, times and by same nurse during their episode of care. The objective is to maximise the number of patient visits for a set of nurses during the planning horizon. We propose a new heuristic based on generating several scenarios which include current schedules of nurses, the new request under consideration, as well as randomly generated future requests to solve three decision problems: first, do we accept the patient? If so, which nurse services the patient? Finally, which days and times are weekly visits of the patient assigned to? We compare our approach with a greedy heuristic from the literature by considering some real-life aspects such as clustered service areas and skill requirements, and empirically demonstrate that it achieves significantly higher average daily visits and shorter travel times compared to the greedy method. © 2019, The Author(s).},

We investigate the integrated optimization problem for handling resources of the crane area, dual-gantry crane (GC), and internal trucks (ITs). A creative handling scheme is proposed to reduce the long-distance, full-loaded movement of GCs by making use of the advantages of ITs. Based on this scheme, we propose a flexible crossing crane area to balance the workload of dual-GC. Decomposing the integrated problem into four sub-problems, a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model (MIP) is developed. By analyzing the characteristic of the integrated problem, a three-layer hybrid heuristic algorithm (TLHHA) incorporating heuristic rule (HR), elite co-evolution genetic algorithm (ECEGA), greedy rule (GR), and simulated annealing (SA) is designed for solving the problem. Numerical experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm has excellent searching ability, and the simultaneous optimization scheme could ensure the requirements for efficiency, effectiveness, and energy-saving, as well as the balance rate of dual-GC. © 2021 by the authors.

In a multi-robot station, besides workload distribution, operations sequencing, and robot motions, an important issue is robot coordination. A key aspect, so far neglected, is the robot motion delay due to the implementation of robot coordination scheduling: our first contribution is to model these delays into a mathematical formulation in order to minimize their contribution to the overall cycle time. Two different setup scenarios, based on typical hardware setups, are modeled and optimized. The major contribution is an efficient heuristic algorithm to optimize our suggested model, which provides near optimal solutions in fraction of the time required by a general optimization package. We have also integrated such algorithm in a CAM software for robot offline simulation to be able to run industrial scenarios with real CAD models from the automotive industry. The results show that it is possible to reduce the delays due to the synchronization points and consequently cycle time, while still maintaining the pre-computed nominal time scheduling for robot coordination. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The energy problem is one of the most important challenges in the application of sensor networks. With the development of wireless charging technology and intelligent mobile charger (MC), the energy problem can be solved by the wireless charging strategy. In the practical application of wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs), the energy consumption rate of nodes is dynamically changed due to many uncertainties, such as the death and different transmission tasks of sensor nodes. However, existing works focus on on-demand schemes, which not fully consider real-Time global charging scheduling. In this article, a novel dynamic charging scheme (DCS) in WRSN based on the actor-critic reinforcement learning (ACRL) algorithm is proposed. In the ACRL, we introduce gated recurrent units (GRUs) to capture the relationships of charging actions in time sequence. Using the actor network with one GRU layer, we can pick up an optimal or near-optimal sensor node from candidates as the next charging target more quickly and speed up the training of the model. Meanwhile, we take the tour length and the number of dead nodes as the reward signal. Actor and critic networks are updated by the error criterion function of R and V. Compared with current on-demand charging scheduling algorithms, extensive simulations show that the proposed ACRL algorithm surpasses heuristic algorithms, such as the Greedy, DP, nearest job next with preemption, and TSCA in the average lifetime and tour length, especially against the size and complexity increasing of WRSNs. © 2014 IEEE.},

In this work, a simple and effective bi-objective GRASP algorithm for the MWVCP is developed in the first stage. One important characteristic of the proposed GRASP is that it avoids the use of weighted sums of objective functions in the local search and the greedy algorithm. In the second stage, the bi-objective GRASP is extended to the FSS by adding a learning mechanism adapted to multi-objective problems. The conducted computational experiments show that the proposed FSS and GRASP algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods for the bi-objective MWVCP. To fully evaluate the learning mechanism of the FSS, it is compared to the underlying GRASP algorithm on a wide range of performance indicators related to convergence, distribution, spread and cardinality. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Beyond the widely-studied scheduling of wafers within cluster tools, a novel and important perspective is raised in this paper to tackle an upper-level optimization problem in real-world production, i.e., the assignment of hybrid types of wafer lots to a set of cluster tools with parallel modules to minimize the maximum completion time for the lots. The main difficulty in addressing such a problem is that the objective, i.e., the maximum completion time, cannot be calculated explicitly beforehand. To make this problem tractable, the associated maximal overlap among tools is utilized to heuristically evaluate the objective for the problem. Besides, since the cluster tools for processing are identical, we further tackle this problem as a clustering issue. Accordingly, a clustering algorithm based on greedy searching is proposed to allocate wafer lots into cluster tools while minimizing the maximal overlap. To elucidate our method and its significance in real-world production, the wet bench tool in wet cleaning process is taken as a case study. We compare the proposed algorithm with the empirical method in fabs and several intelligent optimization algorithms, and the experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed method in terms of improved efficiency.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

This study addresses the bi-objective critical chain project scheduling problem aiming at minimising both project make-span and cost. We formulate the conceptual model considering project make-span and cost under both the resourceconstraints and precedence relations. In the model, the promised delivery time is used as project make-span, and the discounted cost is used to measure project cost. To solve the problem, an evolutionary algorithm based on greedy randomised adaptive search procedure (GRASP) is proposed to search for the non-dominated solutions of the problem. Several neighbourhood search methods are investigated and compared with each other regarding four multi-objective performance measures: Optimal ratio, hyper-volume indicator, epsilon metric and average distance. The computational tests have indicated the algorithm with variable neighbourhood appears to be superior to others. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Using key elements of the iterated greedy algorithm, this paper proposes a population-based iterated greedy (PBIG) algorithm for finding high-quality schedules in no-wait job shops. Firstly, the Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) heuristic used for flow shop is extended in no-wait job shops, and an initialization scheme based on the NEH heuristic is developed to generate start solutions with a certain quality and diversity. Secondly, the iterated greedy procedure is introduced based on the destruction and construction perturbator and the insert-based local search. Furthermore, a population-based coevolutionary scheme is presented by imposing the iterated greedy procedure in parallel and hybridizing both the left timetabling and inverse left timetabling methods. Computational results based on well-known benchmark instances show that the proposed algorithm outperforms two existing metaheuristics by a significant margin. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Reorganizing bus frequencies to cater for the actual travel demands can significantly save the cost of the public transport system. Many, if not all, previous studies formulate this as a bus frequency optimization problem that tries to minimize passengers' average waiting time. On the other hand, many investigations have confirmed that the user satisfaction drops faster as the waiting time increases. Consequently, this paper studies the bus frequency optimization problem considering the user satisfaction. Specifically, for the first time to our best knowledge, we study how to schedule the buses such that the total number of passengers who could receive their bus services within the waiting time threshold can be maximized. We propose two variants of the problem, FAST and FASTCO, to cater for different application needs and prove that both are NP-hard. To solve FAST effectively and efficiently, we first present an index-based (1-1/e)(1-1/e)-Approximation algorithm. By exploiting the locality property of routes in a bus network, we further propose a partition-based greedy method that achieves a (1-ρ)(1-1/e)(1-ρ)(1-1/e) approximation ratio. Then we propose a progressive partition-based greedy method to further boost the efficiency while achieving a (1-ρ)(1-1/e-\varepsilon)(1-ρ)(1-1/e-ϵ) approximation ratio. For the FASTCO problem, two greedy-based heuristic methods are proposed. Experiments on a real city-wide bus dataset in Singapore have been conducted to verify the efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability of our methods in addressing FAST and FASTCO respectively.  © 1989-2012 IEEE.},

It is a variation of the DPFSP with job release dates that maximizes the total payoff with a stepwise job objective function. The main contributions are summarized as follows. (1) A mathematical model is built to formulate the new problem. (2) The characteristics of the problem are explored, and the upper and lower bounds of the problem are given. Based on the problem-specific knowledge, an algorithm named Insert-Pruning is proposed to improve the efficiency of search. (3) Nine heuristic algorithms are proposed, including DRI, DRA, DEI, DEA, DNI, DNA, DII, DIA and DFF. (4) Combined with the characteristics of the problem, some modifications and improvements have been made to the IG algorithm to solve it, including the destruction method, the local search method and the acceptance criterion. (5) The experimental results show that the presented algorithm significantly outperforms the existing algorithms in the literature. In comparison with other competing algorithms in different dimensions, our algorithm has shown better performance, which verifies the effectiveness of this algorithm. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Massive Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) and Coordinated MultiPoint (CoMP) technologies in Cloud-RAN (C-RAN) architecture become inevitable trend due to the advent of next-generation mobile applications, which are traffic-intensive, such as ultra high definition (UHD) video. In this paper, we study a joint beam activation and user scheduling problem in a 5G cellular network with massive MIMO and CoMP utilizing orthogonal random beamforming technique. This paper aims to minimize total Remote Radio Heads' (RRHs') energy expenditure in a dynamic C-RAN architecture while ensuring finite service time for all user traffic arrivals in the communication coverage. We leverage Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework to transform an original long-term average problem into a series of per-slot modified problems. Since the provided per-slot problem is combinatorial and nonlinear optimization problem, we are inspired by a greedy algorithm to design energy and delay guaranteed joint beam activation and user scheduling policy, namely BEANS. We prove that the proposed BEANS ensures finite upper bounds of average RRH energy consumption and average queue backlogs for all traffic arrival rates within constant ratio of capacity region and all energy-delay tradeoff parameters. These proofs are the first attempt to theoretically demonstrate guarantees of energy and queue bounds in a framework consisting of possibly negative submodular objective function and non-matriod constraints. Finally, via extensive simulations, we compare the capacity region and energy-queue backlog tradeoff of BEANS with optimal and existing algorithms, and show that BEANS attains up to 65% of energy saving for the same average queue backlog compared to the algorithms which do not take traffic dynamics and energy consumption into considerations. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Control scheduling refers to the problem of assigning agents or actuators to act upon a dynamical system at specific times so as to minimize a quadratic control cost, such as the objectives of the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) or linear quadratic regulator problems. When budget or operational constraints are imposed on the schedule, this problem is in general NP-hard and its solution can therefore only be approximated even for moderately sized systems. The quality of this approximation depends on the structure of both the constraints and the objective. This article shows that greedy control scheduling is near-optimal when the constraints can be written as an intersection of matroids, algebraic structures that encode requirements such as limits on the number of agents deployed per time slot, total number of actuator uses, and duty cycle restrictions. To do so, it proves that the LQG cost function is α-supermodular and provides new α /(α + P)-optimality certificates for the greedy minimization of such functions over an intersection of P matroids. These certificates are shown to approach the 1/(1+P) guarantee of supermodular functions in relevant settings. These results support the use of greedy algorithms in nonsupermodular quadratic control problems as opposed to typical heuristics such as convex relaxations and surrogate figures of merit, e.g., the of the controllability Gramian.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {During recent years, the distributed permutation flowshop scheduling problem (DPFSP) has become a very active area of research. However, minimising total tardiness in DPFSP, a very essential and relevant objective for today's customer-orientated market, has not been studied much. In this paper, we address the DPFSP with the total tardiness criterion. We present a mixed-integer linear programming model, two heuristics, hybrid discrete Harris hawks optimisation and an enhanced variant of iterated greedy algorithm to solve the considered problem. Problem-specific knowledge is explored and effective technologies, such as path relinking and random sub-sequence/single-point local search, are employed to improve the presented algorithms. The operators and parameters of the algorithms are analysed and calibrated using the design of experiments. To evaluate the performance, the well-known benchmark problem set of Naderi and Ruiz for DPFSP is extended with due dates. We compare the presented algorithms against seven other well-known meta-heuristics from the literature. Statistically sound results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented algorithms for the considered problem. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the job shop scheduling problem including time lag constraints. This is an extension of the job shop scheduling problem with many applications in real production environments, where extra (minimum and maximum) delays can be introduced between operations. It belongs to a category of problems known as NP-hard problems due to the large solution space. Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) is an evolutionary algorithm which is inspired by the migration of species between habitats, recently proposed by Simon (IEEE Trans Evol Comput 12:702–713, 2008) to optimize hard combinatorial optimization problems. BBO has successfully solved optimization problems in many different domains and has demonstrated excellent performance. We propose a hybrid biogeography-based optimization (HBBO) algorithm for solving the job shop scheduling problem with additional time lag constraints while minimizing total completion time. In the proposed HBBO, an effective greedy constructive heuristic is adapted to generate the initial habitat population. A local search metaheuristic is investigated in the mutation step in order to improve the solution quality and enhance the diversity of the population. To assess the performance of the HBBO, a series of experiments are performed on well-known benchmark instances for job shop scheduling problems with time lag constraints. The results prove the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in comparison with various other algorithms. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, a large focus is given to mass personalisation, and multiple path shop floors are suited to such production environments. Hence, this paper deals with the Job-shop scheduling problem that is used for modelling a manufacturing system. Meanwhile, a large attention is given to energy consumption of production systems, but few works consider power requirements of the production systems in order to process operations. In order to contribute in filling this gap, this paper considers the problem where the objective is to minimise both the total completion time of all operations and the instant available power required to process these operations. The problem results in the Bi-objective Job-shop Problem with Power Requirements (Bi-JSPPR). The goal of this paper is to provide a Pareto frontier of schedules minimising both criteria, considering that operations may consume a lot of power at the beginning of the process (consumption peak), more than its consumption after a while, which allows to model power profiles of manufacturing operations. To solve the problem two metaheuristic approaches are investigated: a hybrid Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and an iterated Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure coupled with an Evolutionary Local Search (iGRASP×ELS). An efficient local search procedure is specifically designed to improve the quality of solutions in the Pareto frontier of the hybrid NSGA-II (hNSGA-II). Computational experiments and statistical tests are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the approaches. Results show that both approach are complementary, having the hNSGA-II showing better average performances, while the iGRASP×ELS is better when high peak power consumption are considered. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Bike-sharing service refers to the mode of bike rental service provided by bike rental companies in public service areas, so as to provide a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly carbon-free transport for urban users. In the face of increasing crowded traffic status and serious environmental problems, bike sharing caters to a greener and healthier option for people's short trips with the powerful resource integration power, which has been a pivotal component of urban transportation. According to the data provided by iMedia Research, the number of bike-sharing users in China reached 235 million in 2018. There is no doubt that sharing bicycles improves people's travel convenience and urban traffic condition, while they have also brought some new problems. Due to the unreasonable allocation of bicycle resources, the company always encounters the unexpected situation that in some areas there is not bicycle available, while the bikes in other areas are piled up in a disorderly manner. In such a case, there is an imbalance between the supply and demand in the bike sharing network, which not only causes the waste of resources, but also increases the management cost of operators. For the unreasonable resource allocation in the sharing network, this paper divides the random distribution network of bicycles into multiple clusters with similar saptio-temporal attributes through cluster analysis. The article transforms the bicycle scheduling problem into a vehicle routing problem with time windows and load limitations, and then proposes a scheduling path optimization model and designs algorithms to solve it. The research contents and conclusions of this paper are as follows. In the first part, the paper expounds the practical background and significance of the research topic. It introduces the development of China's bike-sharing market, compares the advantages and disadvantages of several mainstream operating modes, and lists the significance of the study for operators, consumers and society. Secondly, we introduce the theoretical basis of relevant problems, including the scheduling scheme of shared bikes, the VRP problem and relevant scheduling algorithms. The second part is literature review. It is a rough sorting of the literature on the scheduling optimization researches for bike sharing scheduling, including the research on station-based bike sharing (SBBS) and the research on free-floating bike sharing (FFBS). This part also illustrates the research results of some domestic and foreign scholars who innovatively combined the clustering algorithm with the VPR problem. In the third part, we design and construct the scheduling optimization model and algorithm. (1) As free-floating shared bicycles can be parked anywhere, how to accurately describe and classify the distribution of bicycles in the network has become the key to demand forecast and schedule. Moreover, the demand for shared bikes has obvious spatial temporal attributes, which are reflected in the imbalance of demand distribution in time and space. Hence, the paper would aggregate the cell regions with similar time-space attributes into clusters similar to “virtual base stations” through k-means cluster analysis, and it is deemed as the access objectives of dispatchers. (2) We build the scheduling model with the target of minimum cost. The scheduling cost in the objective function includes the fixed cost, the transportation cost, the loading cost, and the unloading cost. Moreover, we add penalty cost to measure whether the cluster division is feasible. In addition, this paper also considers the constraints on the driving distance and the load of the dispatching vehicle to make the model more realistic. (3) To solve the feasible approximate solution of the corresponding VPR (NP-hard) problem, this paper designs the greedy algorithm and the genetic algorithm to solve the model. In particular, the performances of the algorithms are compared in the follow-up. The fourth part is simulation. According to certain rules, we generate the data of the demand for shared bikes and the distribution of the bike-sharing network in the designated period. Through data simulation, the role of the frame and model in the actual scheduling is studied. The conclusion shows that the number of clusters will greatly affect the scheduling cost; secondly, the overall optimization of the genetic algorithm is better than that of the greedy algorithm, but the greedy algorithm could take less time. The fifth part is the summary and future work. This section points out that more attention should be paid to user-based scheduling in the future, such as studying the role of pricing and rules in guiding the bike-sharing consumers to actively assist operators in resource scheduling. In summary, this paper uses the cluster analysis method to analyze the spatio-temporal attributes of demand in bicycle-sharing network. Moreover, on the base of the spatio-temporal attributes, demand forecasting and scheduling path optimization are carried out. The framework suggested by this paper provides feasible idea for scheduling activities and academic study, which has certain reference significance. The management implications of the conclusions reached in this article are as follows. (1) Enterprise managers need to get more acquainted with the user's stickiness and satisfaction with the company's bike-sharing services and determine the appropriate number of dispatching clusters to achieve competitive advantage by reducing dispatching costs. (2) The heuristic algorithm has shown excellent ability when optimizing the scheduling path. Compared with genetic algorithm, although greedy algorithm has a great advantage in solving time, the overall optimization effect is slightly inferior. Hence, operators should make a trade-off between time and accuracy when choosing an algorithm. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.},

However, DPFSP with uncertain processing times (DPFSP_UPT) has not been addressed so far although real manufacturing systems often encounter various uncertain factors which make processing times uncertain. In this paper, two local-search based metaheuristics, i.e., an Iterated Greedy algorithm (sIG) and an Iterated Local Search algorithm (sILS), are presented to solve the DPFSP_UPT with makespan criterion. A robust model of expect-risk rule is used to describe the DPFSP_UPT. A valid heuristic based on the well-known NEH heuristic is proposed to initialize sIG and sILS. An acceleration algorithm is adapted to save computational efforts. A destruction procedure with dynamic sizes is presented to enhance the exploration capability for sIG. A feature with the characteristic that small changes in the solution can preserve the properties of good solutions in the iterative process is applied by sILS. Both sIG and sILS use multiple local search methods to produce promising solutions by exploiting diverse search areas. Extensive experiments show that the proposed sIG and sILS perform significantly better than the five competing algorithms adapted in the literature, but there is no significant difference between sIG and sILS and each has its own advantages for different instances. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Scheduling in distributed production environments has become common in recent years since the advantages of multi factory manufacturing have been growing. This paper examines the distributed blocking flowshop scheduling problem (DBFSP) to minimize the makespan. Two different mathematical models, namely a mixed-integer programming model and a constraint programming model, were proposed to solve the considered problem to optimality. Due to the NP-Hard nature of the problem, large-size instances cannot be solved by the mathematical models, and an evolutionary algorithm was proposed. Three different NEH-based heuristics were used, and the first three solutions are included in the initial population, whereas the rest is constructed randomly. The offspring population is generated by the self-adaptive destruction and construction (DC) procedure of the iterated greedy algorithm. Self-adaptive DC procedure is achieved by the evolution strategy approach. In the local search part of the algorithm, a variable local search with three neighborhood structures was applied to the solution obtained by the DC procedure. The developed mathematical models initially verified the performance of the metaheuristic algorithm by using small instances. Then, the proposed algorithm was tested on the benchmark suite from the literature. The computational results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other metaheuristic algorithms from the literature. Finally, the solutions of the 156 best so far were obtained by the proposed algorithm, which is more effective than the existing state-of-the-art methods. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of minimizing the makespan on unrelated parallel machines with sequence-dependent setup times. The term unrelated machines is used in the sense that there is no correlation between the processing times for jobs between different machines. Due to the NP-hardness of this problem, a wide range of metaheuristics has been developed to find near-optimal solutions. Out of such methods, the ones based on constructive greedy algorithms like the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Worm Optimization (WO) proved to be most efficient. The Fixed Set Search (FSS) is a novel population-based metaheuristic of this type that adds a learning mechanism to the GRASP. The basic concept of FSS is to avoid focusing on specific high quality solutions but on parts or elements that such solutions have. This is done through fixing a set of elements that exist in such solutions and dedicating computational effort to finding near-optimal solutions for the underlying subproblem. In this work, the FSS is applied to the problem of interest. Computational experiments show that the FSS manages to significantly outperform the GRASP, ACO and WO on the standard benchmark instances when the quality of found solutions is considered without an increase in computational cost. This application of the FSS is significant as it shows that it can also be applied to scheduling type problems, in addition to covering and routing ones. © 2021},

This article presents a bio-inspired approach for addressing the problem of colocation datacenters participating in demand response programs in a smart grid. The proposed approach allows the datacenter to negotiate with its tenants by offering monetary rewards in order to meet a demand response event on short notice. The objective of the underlying optimization problem is twofold. The goal of the datacenter is to minimize its offered rewards while the goal of the tenants is to maximize their profit. A two-level hierarchy is proposed for modeling the problem. The upper-level hierarchy models the datacenter planning problem, and the lower-level hierarchy models the task scheduling problem of the tenants. To address these problems, two bio-inspired algorithms are designed and compared for the datacenter planning problem, and an efficient greedy scheduling heuristic is proposed for task scheduling problem of the tenants.

In the flow shop, the assembly operations in the second stage should start within the limited waiting times after those components complete in the first stage. For this problem, a mixed-integer programming formulation is provided, and this formulation is used to find an optimal solution using a commercial optimization solver CPLEX. As this problem is proved to be NP‐hard, various heuristic algorithms (priority rule‐based list scheduling, constructive heuristic, and me-taheuristic) are proposed to solve a large‐scale problem within a short computation time. To evalu-ate the proposed algorithms, a series of computational experiments, including the calibration of the metaheuristics, were performed on randomly generated problem instances, and the results showed outperformance of the proposed iterated greedy algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in small‐ and large‐sized problems, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The no-idle permutation flowshop scheduling problem (NIPFSP) extends the well-known permutation flowshop scheduling problem, where idle time is not allowed on the machines. This study proposes a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model and a new constraint programming (CP) model for the NIPFSP with makespan criterion. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents a CP model for the NIPFSP for the first time in the literature. We also compare the performance of the proposed MILP and CP models with a well-known MILP model from the literature. Since the studied problem is NP-hard, we also develop a new iterated greedy algorithm with restart and learning mechanisms (IG_RL) and a new iterated local search with restart and learning mechanisms (ILS_RL) as metaheuristics for the problem. In the proposed algorithms, all the parameters are determined by a learning mechanism in a self-adaptive way. Furthermore, a restart mechanism is employed in the proposed IG_RL and ILS_RL algorithms to guarantee the variety of the initial solutions and to assist the algorithm in avoiding the local optima. A variable neighborhood descent procedure is also embedded in the proposed algorithms. We use two well-known benchmark sets, i.e., VRF and Ruiz benchmark suites, to evaluate the performance of proposed solution methods. For almost half of the 240 small VRF instances, optimal results are reported by the MILP and CP models, whereas time-limited model results are reported for the rest. The results on small instances show that the proposed MILP and CP models outperform the MILP model from literature, where the CP model performs better than both MILP models. We compare the performance of the proposed IG_RL and ILS_RL algorithms with the state-of-the-art metaheuristics from the literature on both large VRF instances and Ruiz benchmark instances. The computational results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed ILS_RL and IG_RL algorithms for solving the NIPFSP. Primarily, this study improves the current best-known solutions for 102 out of the 250 Ruiz benchmark instances. Additionally, this study reports the NIPFSP results for the well-known VRF benchmark set for the first time in the literature. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been considered as a promising paradigm to support the growing popularity of mobile devices (MDs) with similar capabilities as cloud computing. Most existing research focuses on MEC enabled by terrestrial base stations (BSs), which is unable to work in certain scenarios, e.g., disaster rescue and field operation. Some researchers have been making efforts on studying MEC assisted by unmanned-aerial-vehicles (UAVs) and developed lots of efficient scheduling algorithms. However, MEC assisted only by UAVs has limited capability and is unsuitable for heavy-computation applications. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel UAV-and-BS hybrid enabled MEC system, where multiple UAVs and one BS are deployed to facilitate the provisioning of MEC services either directly from UAVs or indirectly from the BS. Considering maximizing the lifetime of all MDs, the energy-efficient scheduling problem is formulated as minimizing the energy consumption of all MDs by jointly optimizing UAV trajectories, task associations, computing-and-transmitting resource allocations. The optimization problem is further decomposed into three sub-problems and solved by the proposed hybrid heuristic and learning based scheduling algorithms to reduce the complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve promising performance improvements over baseline algorithms, including local-computing, random-offloading and greedy-offloading. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing enables the execution of various applications submitted by the users in the virtualized Cloud environment. However, the Cloud infrastructure consumes a significant amount of electrical energy to provide services to its users that have a detrimental effect on the environment. Many of these applications (tasks), like those belonging to the healthcare system, scientific research, the Internet of Things (IoT), and others, are deadline-sensitive. Hence efficient scheduling of tasks is essential to prevent deadline violation, decrease makespan, and at the same time reduce energy consumption. To address this issue, we have considered the bi-objective optimization problem of minimization of energy and makespan and have proposed two scheduling approaches for independent, deadline-sensitive tasks in a heterogeneous Cloud environment. Our first approach is a greedy heuristic based on the Linear Weighted Sum technique. The second one is based on Ant Colony Optimization and uses a combination of heuristic search and positive feedback of information to improve the solution. Both approaches use a three-tier model where tasks are scheduled by taking into account the properties of three entities- tasks, VMs, and hosts. Moreover, we have proposed a suitable strategy for scaling of Cloud resources to improve energy-efficiency and task schedulability. Extensive simulations using Google Cloud trace-logs and comparison with some state-of-art approaches validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheduling techniques in achieving a proper trade-off between the energy consumption of the virtualized Cloud infrastructure and the average makespan of the tasks. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

In this paper, we investigate the blocking hybrid flow shop scheduling problem under the constraint of sequence dependent setup time. The objective is to minimize the total tardiness and earliness with uniform parallel machines under the constraint of sequence dependent setup time. To solve this kind of problems, significant developments of new meta-heuristic algorithms make it possible to implement new metaheuristics inspired by the behavior of living beings or natural phenomena. In this context, we suggest six algorithms based on the migratory bird optimization and the water wave optimization algorithms. We give three new versions for each meta-heuristic in order to solve this optimization problem. The main improvement of the suggested algorithms concerns the exploration phase of the neighborhood system. The enhancement approaches are based on the iterated greedy algorithm, the greedy randomized adaptive search procedure, the path relinking technique and the local search procedures. These modifications in the two nature inspired meta-heuristics make it possible to develop a new neighborhood generation structure constituting hybrid optimization algorithms. A comparative study between the different proposed methods is carried out on a variety of problems ranging from small to relatively large size instances.

	abstract = {In the last decades, cities have increased the number of activities and services that depends on an efficient and reliable electricity service. In particular, households have had a sustained increase of electricity consumption to perform many residential activities. Thus, providing efficient methods to enhance the decision making processes in demand-side management is crucial for achieving a more sustainable usage of the available resources. In this line of work, this article presents an optimization model to schedule deferrable appliances in households, which simultaneously optimize two conflicting objectives: the minimization of the cost of electricity bill and the maximization of users satisfaction with the consumed energy. Since users satisfaction is based on human preferences, it is subjected to a great variability and, thus, stochastic resolution methods have to be applied to solve the proposed model. In turn, a maximum allowable power consumption value is included as constraint, to account for the maximum power contracted for each household or building. Two different algorithms are proposed: a simulation-optimization approach and a greedy heuristic. Both methods are evaluated over problem instances based on real-world data, accounting for different household types. The obtained results show the competitiveness of the proposed approach, which are able to compute different compromising solutions accounting for the trade-off between these two conflicting optimization criteria in reasonable computing times. The simulation-optimization obtains better solutions, outperforming and dominating the greedy heuristic in all considered scenarios. © 2022 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.},

	abstract = {Production scheduling plays an important role in the intelligent decision support system and intelligent optimization decision technology. In the context of the globalization trend, the current production and management may extend from a single factory to a distributed production network. In this paper, we study the distributed blocking flowshop scheduling problem (DBFSP) that is an important generalization of the traditional blocking flowshop scheduling problem in the distributed environment. Six constructive heuristics and an iterated greedy (IG) algorithm are proposed to minimize the makespan, which provides procedures for obtaining efficient and effective solutions to make decision-making sounder. The first five heuristics are developed based on the well-known NEH2 heuristic [B. Naderi, R. Ruiz, The distributed permutation flowshop scheduling problem, Computers & Operations Research, 37 (4) (2010) 754–768.] and the last heuristic is presented by extending the PW heuristic [Q.K. Pan, L. Wang, Effective heuristics for the blocking flowshop scheduling problem with makespan minimization, Omega, 40 (2) (2012) 218–229.] to DBFSP in an effective way. The composite heuristics that combining constructive heuristics and local searches are also studied. The proposed composite heuristics are chosen to generate an initial solution with a high level of quality. Keeping the simplicity of the IG algorithm, three local search procedures, two destruction procedures, an improved reconstruction procedure, and a simulated annealing-like acceptance criterion are well designed based on the problem-specific knowledge to enhance the IG algorithm. The computational experiments are carried out based on the 720 benchmark instances from the literature. The results show that the proposed heuristics are very effective for solving the problem under consideration and the presented IG algorithm performs significantly better than the other state-of-the-art metaheuristics from the literature. © 2021},

Jobs launched in production are of different characteristics and require a machine preparation time at each phase during their production cycle. The goal is to minimize the total tardiness of all jobs when they are completed on the last stage. The hybrid flow shop problem is considered as one of the NP-hard issues since it consists of at least two stages. To solve numerically this problem, we propose two methods, the iterative local search (ILS) and the iterated greedy (IG) metaheuristics. In addition, we suggest two new improvements, the first relates to the initial step while the second concerns the steps of the neighborhood exploration. In the initial phase, we consider an initial solution set generated from the priority rules whose scheduling is ensured by the Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) algorithm and the greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP). In the second phase, we suggest a new version of exploration of the neighborhood. In fact, from a single solution, we will generate a set of neighboring solutions and we will choose the best solution. In this new resolution approach, we develop a total of twelve algorithms based on neighborhood exploration. We note that the proposed algorithms are hybrid metaheuristics and are among the most powerful optimization algorithms in local search. A simulation study is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the suggested algorithms.This simulation is performed on a set of instances by varying the number of jobs, the number of machines per stage and the number of stages. We find that the IG algorithm based on NEH initialization heuristic gives good results in terms of quality and convergence time to the best solution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Delay-sensitive tasks account for an increasing proportion of all tasks on the Internet of Things (IoT). How to solve such problems has become a hot research topic. Delay-sensitive tasks scenarios include intelligent vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, industrial IoT, intelligent transportation, etc. More and more scenarios have delay requirements for tasks and simply reducing the delay of tasks is not enough. However, speeding up the processing speed of a task means increasing energy consumption, so we try to find a way to complete tasks on time with the lowest energy consumption. Hence, we propose a heuristic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on a Lyapunov framework (LPSO). Since task duration and queue stability are guaranteed, a balance is achieved between the computational energy consumption of the IoT nodes, the transmission energy consumption and the fog node computing energy consumption, so that tasks can be completed with minimum energy consumption. Compared with the original PSO algorithm and the greedy algorithm, the performance of our LPSO algorithm is significantly improved. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {In the field of industrial manufacturing, assembly line production is the most common production process that can be modeled as a permutation flow shop scheduling problem (PFSP). Minimizing the late work criteria (tasks remaining after due dates arrive) of production planning can effectively reduce production costs and allow for faster product delivery. In this article, a novel learning‐based approach is proposed to minimize the late work of the PFSP using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and graph isomorphism network (GIN), which is an innovative combination of the field of combinatorial optimization and deep learning. The PFSPs are the well‐known permutation flow shop problem and each job comes with a release date constraint. In this work, the PFSP is defined as a Markov decision process (MDP) that can be solved by reinforcement learning (RL). A complete graph is introduced for describing the PFSP instance. The proposed policy network combines the graph representation of PFSP and the sequence information of jobs to predict the dis-tribution of candidate jobs. The policy network will be invoked multiple times until a complete sequence is obtained. In order to further improve the quality of the solution obtained by reinforcement learning, an improved iterative greedy (IG) algorithm is proposed to search the solution locally. The experimental results show that the proposed RL and the combined method of RL+IG can obtain better solutions than other excellent heuristic and meta‐heuristic algorithms in a short time. © 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, we extend the DPFSP by considering the sequence-dependent setup time (SDST), and present a mathematical model and an iterated greedy algorithm with a restart scheme (IGR). In the IGR, we discard the simulated annealing-like acceptance criterion commonly used in traditional iterated greedy algorithms. A restart scheme with six different operators is proposed to ensure the diversity of the solutions and help the algorithm to escape from local optimizations. Furthermore, to achieve a balance between the exploitation and exploration, we introduce an algorithmic control parameter in the IG stage. Additionally, to further improve the performance of the algorithm, we propose two local search methods based on a job block which is built in the evolution process. A detailed design experiment is carried out to calibrate the parameters for the presented IGR algorithm. The IGR is assessed through comparing with the state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature. The experimental results show that the proposed IGR algorithm is the best-performing one among all the algorithms in comparison. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In on-grid microgrids, electric vehicles (EVs) have to be efficiently scheduled for cost-effective electricity consumption and network operation. The stochastic nature of the involved parameters along with their large number and correlations make such scheduling a challenging task. This paper aims at identifying pertinent innovative solutions for reducing the relevant total costs of the on-grid EVs within hybrid microgrids. To optimally scale the EVs, a heuristic greedy approach is considered. Unlike most existing scheduling methodologies in the literature, the proposed greedy scheduler is model-free, training-free, and yet efficient. The proposed approach considers different factors such as the electricity price, on-grid EVs state of arrival and departure, and the total revenue to meet the load demands. The greedy-based approach behaves satisfactorily in terms of fulfilling its objective for the hybrid microgrid system, which is established of photovoltaic, wind turbine, and a local utility grid. Meanwhile, the on-grid EVs are being utilized as an energy storage exchange location. A real time hardware-in-the-loop experimentation is comprehensively conducted to maximize the earned profit. Through different uncertainty scenarios, the ability of the proposed greedy approach to obtain a global optimal solution is assessed. A data simulator was developed for the purposes of generating evaluation datasets, which captures uncertainties in the behaviors of the system’s parameters. The greedy-based strategy is considered applicable, scalable, and efficient in terms of total operating expenditures. Furthermore, as EVs penetration became more versatile, total expenses decreased significantly. Using simulated data of an effective operational duration of 500 years, the proposed approach succeeded in cutting down the energy consumption costs by about 50–85%, beating existing state-of-the-arts results. The proposed approach is proved to be tolerant to the large amounts of uncertainties that are involved in the system’s operational data. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we are concerned with the resolution of a multiobjective complex job-shop scheduling problem stemming from semiconductor manufacturing. To produce feasible and industrially meaningful schedules, this paper extends the recently proposed batch-oblivious approach by considering unavailability periods and minimum time lags and by simultaneously optimizing multiple criteria that are relevant in the industrial context. A novel criterion on the satisfaction of production targets decided at a higher level is also proposed. Because the solution approach must be embedded in a real-time application, decision makers must express their preferences before the optimization phase. In addition, a preference model is introduced where trade-off is only allowed between some criteria. Two a priori multiobjective extensions of Simulated Annealing are proposed, which differ in how the simultaneous use of a lexicographic order and weights is handled when evaluating the fitness. A known a posteriori approach of the literature is used as a benchmark. All the metaheuristics are embedded in a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure. The different versions of the archived GRASP approach are compared using large industrial instances. The numerical results show that the proposed approach provides good solutions regarding the preferences. Finally, the comparison of the optimized schedules with the actual factory schedules shows the significant improvements that our approach can bring. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The integrated process planning and scheduling (IPPS) problem is studied in this article, in which operation sequencing, process plan selection, and machine selection are decided simultaneously. For different scenarios, three mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models are designed. Then, in view of the workload of machines and processing times of jobs, two machine selection techniques are introduced to simplify the optimization of these MILP models. By exploring the structural properties of the MILP models, we put forward a novel lower bound to act as a measurement for the performance of the related algorithms. Considering the real-time requirement and complexity of instances in practice, we design a hybrid greedy heuristic based on a new decision structure of the problem and dispatching rules. Furthermore, in order to create effective dispatching rules to improve the hybrid greedy heuristic, enhanced genetic programming (GP)-based iterative approach is proposed. Experimental results indicate that our approaches are better than other available approaches for the IPPS problem and can reduce the computational time while providing high-quality solutions. Note to Practitioners - Due to the widespread use of computer numerical control machines and flexible manufacturing systems in the modern manufacturing industry, the IPPS problem has been widely recognized among both academia and industry over the years. So far, many scholars have put forward several approaches to solve this problem. However, for the instances in practical applications, good solutions are still difficult to get in a reasonable time. The rule-based heuristics, on the other hand, have the advantages of practicability and high efficiency, are much more preferred in practice. Nonetheless, it not only takes plenty of time but requires domain expertise to construct valid dispatching rules for complicated production problems. As an evolution-based machine learning approach, GP has been widely utilized to create dispatching rules for certain scheduling problems. Therefore, in this study, an enhanced GP-based iterative approach is proposed to create dispatching rules for the rule-based heuristic. The computational effectiveness and efficiency of the heuristic based on dispatching rules created by GP are verified in experimental results, and it opens the way for handling the IPPS problem in dynamic environments and multiobjective systems in practice.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a permutation flowshop problem, with a weighted squared tardiness objective function, which addresses an important criterion for many customers. Our objective is to find metaheuristics that can, within acceptable computational times, provide sizeable improvements in solution quality over the best existing procedure (a dispatching rule followed by an improvement method). We consider four metaheuristics, namely iterated local search (ILS), iterated greedy (IG), variable greedy (VG) and steady-state genetic algorithms (SSGA). These are known for performing well on permutation flowshops and/or on tardiness criteria. For each metaheuristic, four versions are developed, differing on the choice of initial sequence and/or local search. Additionally, four different time limits are considered. Therefore, a total of 64 sets of results are obtained. The results show that all procedures greatly outperform the best existing method. The IG procedures provide the best results, followed by the SSGA procedures. The VG methods are usually inferior to SSGA, while the ILS metaheuristics tend to be the worst performers. The four metaheuristics prove to be robust in what regards initial solution and local search method, since both have little effect on the performance of the metaheuristics. Increasing the time limit does improve the performance of all procedures. Still, a sizeable improvement is obtained even for the lowest time limit. Therefore, even under restrictive time limits, the metaheuristics greatly outperform the best existing procedure. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Due to the diversified applications of RCPSPs, they have been commonly used as scheduling procedures in real-world problems. Since, in practice, project data are prone to changes or disruptions, this paper introduces a mathematical model for a reactive scheduling approach, called the Event Based Reactive Approach (EBRA). This proposed EBRA approach is employed to examine its recovery performance under both a single disruption and a series of independent resource disruptions. Several simulated disruption data are hypothesized to represent real-world disruption scenarios and, without loss of generality, the proposed reactive approach is proved to be efficient in reducing the number of variables and computational complexity and also to be resilient in realistic changes, such as duration inflation and dynamic resource usages. Along with employing an exact method by LINGO software, this paper also proposes an enhanced iterated greedy (EnIG) approach to meta-heuristically solve larger and computationally expensive benchmark instances taken from the Project Scheduling Library (PSPLIB). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper studies a hybrid flow-shop scheduling problem with limited buffers and two process routes that comes from an engine hot-test production line in a diesel engine assembly plant. It extends the classical hybrid flow-shop scheduling problem by considering practical constraints on buffer area resources and alternative process routes. Because of its NP-hardness and large scale, traditional optimization methods and heuristic rules cannot obtain satisfactory solutions. A discrete whale swarm algorithm (DWSA) is proposed to identify near-optimal solutions efficiently. The proposed algorithm adopts an encoding method based on the problem characteristic and a greedy delayed decoding strategy to avoid infeasible solutions. A hybrid initialization is used to ensure the quality of the initial population and diversity. A new way of computing distances and a movement rule between individuals are designed. Five mutation operators and a deduplication strategy are proposed to improve the population diversity. The effectiveness of the proposed DWSA is validated on three groups of instances and a real-world industrial case. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of cloud computing, scheduling the complex scientific workflow on the cloud becomes an extraordinarily challenging problem. Especially, the workflow scheduling in cloud environment often need to meet several constraints such as budget. To reduce the execution time subject to a specific budget, this paper proposes a novel adaptive iterated local search framework (AILS). In the proposed AILS, a greedy resource provisioning scheme and HEFT are combined to generate the initial solution. Based on a budget-aware diversification strategy and level-based order perturbation strategy, a perturbation mechanism is applied to perform exploration. In addition, a novel intensification strategy is utilized to execute exploitation. Furthermore, an adaptive penalty function is employed to guide the search near the bound of feasible solution space. Based on the components of AILS, the Markov chain is employed to analyze the convergence of AILS. A comprehensive comparison is constructed to evaluate the proposed AILS, the simulating results indicate that the average relative percentage deviation of AILS is 3.6% lower than that of GRP-HEFT. Compared with the meta-heuristics, the AILS is effective and competitive for the considered problem. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

For the decisional criteria, the proposed approach considers four objective functions, including two quantitative and two qualitative criteria. While the expected value and the standard deviation of the earliness/tardiness of jobs are included in the quantitative criteria to address a robust solution in a just-in-time environment, this approach also includes a qualitative assessment of the product and customer importance in order to appraise a weighted priority for each job. An experimental design was carried out in several study instances of the flow shop problem to test the effects of the processing times and sequence-dependent setup times, obtained through lognormal and uniform probability distributions with three levels of coefficients of variation, settled as 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5. The results show that both probability distributions and coefficients of variation have a significant effect on the four decision criteria selected. In addition, the analytical hierarchical process makes it possible to choose the best sequence exhibited by the Pareto frontier that adjusts more adequately to the decision-makers’ objectives. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Recently, drones, have been utilized in many real‐life applications including healthcare services. For example, providing medical supplies, blood samples, and vaccines to people in remote areas or during emergencies. In this study, the maximum coverage facility location problem with drones (MCFLPD) was studied. The problem is the application of drones in the context of the facility location and routing. It involves selecting the locations of drone launching centers, which maximizes patient service coverage within certain drone range constraints. In this study, a heuristic named the maximum coverage greedy randomized heuristic (MCGRH) is developed. The idea of the algorithm is to first choose some facilities to open at random from among those that can handle the most weight of the patient demands. After that, patients are assigned to the closest opened facility with the capacity to serve them. Finally, drones are assigned to patients based on the least amount of battery consumed between the patient and the facility. Extensive testing of MCGRH indicated that it ranks efficiently alongside other methods in the literature that tried to solve the MCFLPD. It was able to achieve a high coverage of patients (more than 80% on average) within a very fast processing time (less than 1 s on average). © 2022 by the authors.

The urgent jobs and limited waiting times are major considerations for scheduling in semiconductor manufacturing systems. The objective function is to minimize a weighted sum of total tardiness of urgent jobs and the makespan of normal jobs. This problem is formulated in mixed integer programming (MIP). By using a commercial optimization solver, the MIP can be used to find an optimal solution. However, because this problem is proved to be NP-hard, solving to optimality requires a significantly long computation time for a practical size problem. Therefore, this study adopts metaheuristic algorithms to obtain a good solution quickly. To complete this, two metaheuristic algorithms (an iterated greedy algorithm and a simulated annealing algorithm) are proposed, and a series of computational experiments were performed to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. © 2021 by the authors.

Nonperiodical maintenance, which has unfixed maintaining interval or the number of jobs in each group is unfixed, results in a variable number of groups. Deteriorating effects lead to longer processing times of which the deterioration index depends on job grouping. This problem is of significance in different production settings and is much more difficult than and general that other simpler single-machine group scheduling problems. Making use of historical processing times, we construct the actual processing time model for jobs. We prove that the problem under study is NP-hard.

To further improve the effectiveness for large size problems, an iterated greedy algorithm is proposed being its main advantages simplicity and effectiveness.

	abstract = {In this study, we propose an efficient optimization algorithm that is a hybrid of the iterated greedy and simulated annealing algorithms (hereinafter, referred to as IGSA) to solve the flexible job shop scheduling problem with crane transportation processes (CFJSP). Two objectives are simultaneously considered, namely, the minimization of the maximum completion time and the energy consumptions during machine processing and crane transportation. Different from the methods in the literature, crane lift operations have been investigated for the first time to consider the processing time and energy consumptions involved during the crane lift process. The IGSA algorithm is then developed to solve the CFJSPs considered. In the proposed IGSA algorithm, first, each solution is represented by a 2-D vector, where one vector represents the scheduling sequence and the other vector shows the assignment of machines. Subsequently, an improved construction heuristic considering the problem features is proposed, which can decrease the number of replicated insertion positions for the destruction operations. Furthermore, to balance the exploration abilities and time complexity of the proposed algorithm, a problem-specific exploration heuristic is developed. Finally, a set of randomly generated instances based on realistic industrial processes is tested. Through comprehensive computational comparisons and statistical analyses, the highly effective performance of the proposed algorithm is favorably compared against several efficient algorithms. Note to Practitioners - The flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) can be extended and applied to many types of practical manufacturing processes. Many realistic production processes should consider the transportation procedures, especially for the limited crane resources and energy consumptions during the transportation operations. This study models a realistic production process as an FJSP with crane transportation, wherein two objectives, namely, the makespan and energy consumptions, are to be simultaneously minimized. This study first considers the height of the processing machines, and therefore, the crane lift operations and lift energy consumptions are investigated. A hybrid iterated greedy algorithm is proposed for solving the problem considered, and several problem-specific heuristics are embedded to balance the exploration and exploitation abilities of the proposed algorithm. In addition, the proposed algorithm can be generalized to solve other types of scheduling problems with crane transportations. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

Devices, however, have limited energy and operational lifetime. To this end, this article considers supporting virtual network functions (VNFs) in a radio-frequency (RF)-charging network with a hybrid access point (HAP). Our aim is to minimize the energy used by the HAP to power devices in order to support deployed VNFs. It outlines a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to jointly optimize VNFs placement, routing and link scheduling, and also the HAP's charging duration. Furthermore, it proposes a heuristic, called decoupled greedy algorithm (DGA), that first assigns VNFs onto devices with the highest energy level before optimizing the HAP's charging, routing, and link schedule. Our results show that DGA has a probability higher than 0.95 to successfully serve a service request. Furthermore, DGA consumes up to 36.43% less energy than competing methods.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the context of globalization and decentralized economies, the distributed manufacturing and scheduling systems have become emerging in large enterprises. This article addresses the distributed hybrid flow-shop scheduling problem (DHFSP) with heterogeneous factories to minimize makespan. Different from single-factory scheduling problem, DHFSP contains several strongly coupled sub-problems, i.e., factory assignment of jobs and the job sequencing in each hybrid flow-shop. In this article, we present a mixed integer linear programming model for the DHFSP and make a first attempt to propose a bi-population cooperative memetic algorithm (BCMA) for solving such a strongly NP-hard problem. The proposed optimization framework comprises collaborative initialization, bi-population cooperation and local intensification. To generate diverse solutions with small makespan, two knowledge-based heuristics are designed for collaborative initialization by utilizing the lower bound of the problem and the historic information of elite solutions during search process. To balance exploration and exploitation, two populations are evolved in a cooperative way. To further enhance the optimization capability, intensification search with multiple problem-specific operators is incorporated. The effect of parameter setting is investigated and extensive computational tests are carried out. The comparative results show that the BCMA is more effective than both the Math solver Gurobi and the existing iterated greedy algorithm, and the effectiveness of each specific design is also verified in solving DHFSP.  © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new metaheuristic algorithm for scheduling BoT applications, consisting of many independent tasks that can be processed in parallel, in a mobile edge computing environment under mobile device's energy constraint. We formulate this energy-constrained BoT scheduling problem as an integer program. To solve the formulated optimization problem, we propose an efficient scheduling metaheuristic that employs the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) framework to determine the most appropriate task offloading solution. We use a task sequence to represent the offloading solution. The proposed algorithm starts with using the small-size-first policy to generate the initial solution, which is identified as the best individual in the initial whale population. We develop a cost-effective mapping operator to map each whale individual onto a feasible task sequence. We further design a greedy search-based task assignment strategy to determine the assignment of BoT tasks onto MEC servers under the energy constraint, such that the completion time of BoT applications can be determined and used as the fitness value of the corresponding whale individual. Built upon the WOA framework and DM operator, we develop the metaheuristic algorithm to iteratively update the population and explore better solutions. Experimental results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithm in terms of both computational efficiency and scheduling performance when scheduling BoT applications in a MEC environment.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) endow great potentials for future transportation systems, while efficient charge scheduling strategies are crucial for improving profits and mass adoption of EVs. Two critical and open issues concerning EV charging are how to minimize the total charging cost (Objective 1) and how to minimize the peak load (Objective 2). Although extensive efforts have been made to model EV charging problems, little information is available about model properties and efficient algorithms for dynamic charging problems. This paper aims to fill these gaps. For Objective 1, we demonstrate that the greedy-choice property applies, which means that a globally optimal solution can be achieved by making locally optimal greedy choices, whereas it does not apply to Objective 2. We propose a non-myopic charging strategy accounting for future demands to achieve global optimality for Objective 2. The problem is addressed by a heuristic algorithm combining a multi-commodity network flow model with customized bisection search algorithm in a rolling horizon framework. To expedite the solution efficiency, we derive the upper bound and lower bound in the bisection search based on the relationship between charging volume and parking time. We also explore the impact of demand levels and peak arrival ratios on the system performance. Results show that with prediction, the peak load can converge to a globally optimal solution, and that an optimal look-ahead time exists beyond which any prediction is ineffective. The proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, and is robust to the variations of demand and peak arrival ratios.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to investigate the problem of constructing an appointment template for scheduling patients at a specific type of multidisciplinary outpatient clinic called an integrated practice unit (IPU). The focus is on developing and solving a stochastic optimization model for a back pain IPU in the face of random arrivals, an uncertain patient mix, and variable service times. The deterministic version of the problem is modeled as a mixed integer program with the objective of minimizing a weighted combination of clinic closing time (duration) and total patient waiting time (length of stay). A two-stage stochastic program is then derived to account for the randomness and the sequential nature of the decisions. Although it was not possible to solve the two-stage problem for even a limited number of scenarios, the wait-and-see (WS) problem was sufficiently tractable to provide a lower bound on the stochastic solution. The introduction of valid inequalities, limiting indices, and the use of special ordered sets helped to speed up the computations. A greedy heuristic was also developed to obtain solutions much more quickly. Out of practical considerations, it was necessary to develop appointment templates with time slots at fixed intervals, which are not available from the WS solution. The first to be derived was the expected value (EV) template that is used to find the expected value of the EV solution (EEV). This solution provides an upper bound on the objective function value of the two-stage stochastic program. The average gap between the EEV and WS solutions was 18%. Results from extensive computational testing are presented for the EV template and for our adaptation of three other templates found in the literature. Depending on the relative importance of the two objective function metrics, the results demonstrate the trade-off that exists between them. For the templates investigated, the “closing time” ranged from an average of 235 to 275 minutes for a 300-minute session, while the corresponding “total patient time in clinic” ranged from 80 to 71 minutes. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

It has so many applications in the smart city like bus intelligent scheduling and taxi intelligent scheduling. However, most of these works rarely address how to handle the infeasible initial solution. The infeasible solution is an unstable factor in the search framework which gives a negative influence on the quality of the final local optimal solution. In this paper, we present a heuristic repair method (HRM) for DARP. Based on a greedy strategy and proper evaluation function, the HRM will reduce the infeasibility of the most infeasible route by deleting several waypoints in the route and reinsert them into one feasible route. The result of experiments shows that HRM can raise about 50% of the fixing ability of a local search operator. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {For a number of years, due to an exponential increase in the demand for an eco-friendly environment, there has been a rapid increase in the green city revolution across the globe. Subsequently, load shifting of major energy consumers from conventional power grids to renewable energy sources (RES) has become inevitable. Towards this end, cloud data centers (DCs) have emerged as significant consumers of energy that solely rely on power grids to fuel their day-to-day operations. Nevertheless, their energy consumption has increased significantly which in turn has substantially raised the global carbon footprint rate. These challenges can be best addressed by the judicious utilization of RES which have well established advantages like reduced operational costs and carbon emissions. Keeping in view of the above facts, the ultimate goal of the proposed work is to design a comprehensive workload classification; and job scheduling and Vitual machine placement architecture for cloud DCs powered by RES and power grids. For this, a multi-objective optimization scheme is proposed which operates in two phases. In phase I, a random forest-based wrapper scheme known as Boruta, is used for relevant feature set selection for the incoming workload. This is followed by classification of the workload using a locality sensitive hashing-based support vector machines approach. In phase II, a multi-objective optimization problem for job scheduling and VM placement is formulated with respect to parameters such as service level agreement (SLA), energy cost, carbon footprint rate (CFR), and availability of RES. It is further solved using an enhanced heuristic approach based on a greedy strategy. Our experimental evaluations show an average improvement of approximately 31 percent in energy utilization, 28 percent in energy cost, and 36 percent in CFR, with a slight degradation in SLA assurance (about 2 percent) compared with the existing schemes.  © 2013 IEEE.},

This study considers a job shop scheduling problem with reverse flows under uncertainty. Since the main parameter of the model (i.e., the processing time of operations) is tainted with a great degree of uncertainty in real-world applications, a robust programming approach is utilized. This paper proposes a computationally efficient model. Due to the complexity and difficulty of solving the presented model, an exact solution method for small-sized instances and simulated annealing (SA) and discrete harmony search (DHS) algorithms for medium- and large-sized instances are proposed. The model performance is evaluated by comparing the computational results with the literature. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed meta-heuristic algorithms is evaluated by comparing the resulted solutions with the exact method for small-sized instances and with three other meta-heuristics algorithms, such as discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) and invasive weed optimization (DIWO), and iterated greedy (IG) algorithms, for medium- and large-sized instances. The satisfying results show that the presented model and proposed algorithms ensure good quality solutions within a reasonable time for all test problems and the SA algorithm outperforms the DIWO, DPSO, DHS, and IG algorithms in most cases. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The revolution of wireless sensory devices in healthcare services is monitoring of human movements. Such type of motion analysis uses human’s inertial information. This study is achieved by using Body Sensor Network (BSN) in which many wireless sensor nodes are placed on different parts of the body. Disease is recognised by shared processing of sensor information from multiple locations of the body. Even though this platform has high potential in healthcare, the commercialisation of these systems is difficult because of power requirements and wearability problems. In this paper, a self-adaptive greedy buffer allocation and scheduling algorithm (SGBAS) is presented for optimisation of communication model for BSN applications which uses self-adaptive buffers for limitation of communication to short bursts, power usage and transmitting sensed data to the backend servers periodically. The optimisation of QoS is achieved by introducing buffers. This project provides a self-adaptive heuristic scheme which is formulated to reduce transmissions among sensor nodes. For early diagnosis, it sends the data at right time for the analysis of healthcare professionals. Several experimental evaluation and simulations is to be done to assess the proposed SGBAS technique for allocation of buffers in real time under various simulation setups. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SGBAS power reduction techniques. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

As with other computationally hard combinatorial optimization problems, a two-stage heuristic method is developed to obtain high quality solutions in a reasonable amount of computation time. The first stage involves the determination of an observing sequence and the generation of a feasible scheduling scheme. We propose several priority-based and conflict-avoidance heuristic strategies and develop the time-based greedy approaches, the weight-based greedy approaches, and an improved differential evolution (DE) algorithm. The second stage consists of further improvement strategies under different resource contentions, thus improving the scheduling results further. Finally, we design different classes of instances to test the efficiency and applicability of the methods. Computational results reveal that the new proposed methods routinely delivered very close to optimal solutions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {It is challenging to perform emergency scheduling for fighting forest fires subject to limited rescue resources (i.e., vehicles with fire engines), since extinguishing each fire point should take into account multiple factors, such as the actual fire spreading speed, distance from fire engine depot to fire points, fire-fighting speed of fire engines, and the number of dispatched vehicles. This paper investigates a bi-objective rescue vehicle scheduling problem for multi-point forest fires, which aims to optimally dispatch a limited number of fire engines to extinguish fires. The objectives are to minimize the total fire-extinguishing time and the number of dispatched fire engines. For this problem, we first develop an integer program that is an improved and simplified version of an existing one. After exploring some properties of the problem, we develop an exact dynamic programming algorithm and a fast greedy heuristic method. Computational results for a real-life instance, and benchmark and large-size randomly generated instances confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model and algorithms. Besides, a bi-objective integer program is developed to address the multi-depot fire engine scheduling issue. © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As economic globalization, large manufacturing enterprises build production centers in different places to maximize profit. Therefore, scheduling problems among multiple production centers should be considered. This paper studies a distributed hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (DHFSP) with makespan criterion, which combines the characteristic of distributed flow shop scheduling and parallel machine scheduling. In the DHFSP, a set of jobs are assigned into a set of identical factories to process. Each job needs to be through same route with a set of stages, and each stage has several machines in parallel and at least one of stage has more than one machine. For solving the DHFSP, this paper proposes two algorithms: DNEH with smallest-medium rule and multi-neighborhood iterated greedy algorithm. The DNEH with smallest-medium rule constructive heuristic first generates a seed sequence by decomposition and smallest-medium rule, and then uses a greedy iteration to assign jobs to factories. In the iterated greedy algorithm, a multi-search construction is proposed, which applies the greedy insertion to the factory again after inserting a new job. Then, a multi-neighborhood local search is utilized to enhance local search ability. The proposed algorithms are evaluated by a comprehensive comparison, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are very competitive for solving the DHFSP. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Models and optimisation approaches are developed for a flexible job shop scheduling problem with lot streaming and lot sizing of the variable sublots. A two-stage optimisation procedure is proposed. First, the makespan value is minimised with the smallest sublots defined for the problem instance. This makes it possible to shorten the makespan significantly, because each sublot is transferred separately to the next operation of a job. In the second stage, the sizes of the sublots are maximised without increasing the obtained makespan value. In this way, the quantity of sublots and transport activities is limited together with the related manufacturing cost. Two objectives are defined for the second stage. The first one is the maximisation of the sum of the sublot sizes of all operations, the second one is the maximisation of the number of the operations which do not need to be split at all. Mixed-integer linear programming, constraint programming and graph-based models are implemented for the problem. Two optimisation approaches are developed and compared in computational experiments for each stage and objective, one approach is based on a third-party solver, and the second one on an independent own implementation, namely a tabu search and a greedy constructive heuristic. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {We consider a sequencing problem that arises, for example, in the context of scheduling patients in particle therapy facilities for cancer treatment. A set of non-preemptive jobs needs to be scheduled, where each job requires two resources: (1) a common resource that is shared by all jobs and (2) a secondary resource, which is shared with only a subset of the other jobs. While the common resource is only required for a part of the job's processing time, the secondary resource is required for the whole duration. The objective is to minimize the makespan. First we show that the tackled problem is NP-hard and provide three different lower bounds for the makespan. These lower bounds are then exploited in a greedy construction heuristic and a novel exact anytime A⁎ algorithm, which uses an advanced diving mechanism based on Beam Search and Local Search to find good heuristic solutions early. For comparison we also provide a basic Constraint Programming model solved with the ILOG CP optimizer. An extensive experimental evaluation on two types of problem instances shows that the approach works even for large instances with up to 2000 jobs extremely well. It typically yields either optimal solutions or solutions with an optimality gap of less than 1%. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Interactive data visualization and exploration (DVE) applications are often network-bottlenecked due to bursty request patterns, large response sizes, and heterogeneous deployments over a range of networks and devices. This makes it difficult to ensure consistently low response times (< 100ms). Khameleon is a framework for DVE applications that uses a novel combination of prefetching and response tuning to dynamically trade-off response quality for low latency. Khameleon exploits DVE's approximation tolerance: immediate lower-quality responses are preferable to waiting for complete results. To this end, Khameleon progressively encodes responses, and runs a server-side scheduler that proactively streams portions of responses using available bandwidth to maximize user-perceived interactivity. The scheduler involves a complex optimization based on available resources, predicted user interactions, and response quality levels; yet, decisions must also be made in real-time. To overcome this, Khameleon uses a fast greedy heuristic that closely approximates the optimal approach. Using image exploration and visualization applications with real user interaction traces, we show that across a wide range of network and client resource conditions, Khameleon outperforms existing prefetching approaches that benefit from perfect prediction models: Khameleon always lowers response latencies (typically by 2-3 orders of magnitude) while keeping response quality within 50-80%. © 2020, VLDB Endowment.},

	abstract = {An order scheduling problem arises in numerous production scheduling environments. Makespan, mean flow time, and mean tardiness are the most commonly discussed and studied measurable criteria in the research community. Although the order scheduling model with a single objective has been widely studied, it is at odds with real-life scheduling practices. In practice, a typical manager must optimize multiple objectives. A search of the literature revealed that no articles had addressed the issue of optimizing an order scheduling problem with multiple objectives. Therefore, an order scheduling model to minimize the linear sum of the total flowtime and the maximum tardiness is introduced in this study. Specifically, several dominance relations and a lower bound are derived to expedite the search for the optimal solution. Three modified heuristics are proposed for finding near-optimal solutions. A hybrid iterated greedy algorithm and a particle swarm colony algorithm are proposed to solve this problem. Finally, a computational experiment is conducted to evaluate the performances of all proposed algorithms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Most of the previous studies focus on scheduling mobile chargers efficiently for rechargeable sensor nodes. In this paper, we investigate the deployment problem for wireless charging stations (WCSs) in urban areas with respect to the users detouring cost when they move to the candidate WCSs. With pre-known user's trajectories and given number of WCSs, we deploy the WCSs to maximize the number of recharged users with guaranteed probability. We convert our deployment problem into an NP-hard weighted maximum coverage problem, and prove the objective function is a maximum submodular set function. To this end, a simple but efficient greedy algorithm with approximation factor of (1 - 1/e) is proposed for the threshold detouring mode. In addition, an improved algorithm with an approximation factor of (1 - 1/√e) is presented for the linear/nonlinear detouring mode. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our algorithms by comparing them with two typical heuristic algorithms (flow-centric and random-based), and the impacts of different detouring thresholds on our algorithms by synthetic traces. Moreover, real trace-driven evaluations validate that our algorithm improves the coverage quality by 75% when compared to the two aforementioned algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an improved artificial bee colony (IABC) algorithm for addressing the distributed flow shop considering the distance coefficient found in precast concrete production system, with the minimisation of the makespan. In the proposed algorithm, each solution is first represented by a two-dimensional vector, where the first dimensional vector is the factory and the second dimensional vector lists the operation scheduling sequence of each factory. Second, considering the distributed problem feature, a distributed iterated greedy heuristic (DIG) is developed where destruction and construction processes are designed in detail while considering the distributed structures. Third, an efficient population initialisation method that considers the factory workload balance is presented. Then, a local search approach that randomly replaces two factories with two randomly selected jobs and that finds an optimal position for the two inserted operations via the DIG method is proposed. For the canonical ABC algorithm, using the DIG approach, the main three parts are improved, namely, the employee, onlooker, and scout bees. Finally, the proposed algorithm is tested on sets of extended instances based on the well-known benchmarks. Through an analysis of the experimental results, the highly effective proposed IABC algorithm is compared to several efficient algorithms drawn from the literature. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Cloud radio access network (CRAN) is a promising approach to provide ubiquitous and on demand access to future Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The existing CRANs assume a single cloud which suffers from computational complexity and signaling latency to support massive number of IoT devices in large scale network deployments. This paper focuses on the scheduling of IoT devices in a multicloud IoT network scenario. This paper considers the downlink of an IoT network consisting of multiple clouds, each coordinates a cluster of several base stations (BSs) allowing joint signal processing. The transmit frame of each BS is composed of several resource blocks (RBs). The multiple clouds are linked to the central cloud which performs scheduling of IoT devices and synchronization of transmit frames. The work models the IoT devices to RBs assignment problem considering the intercloud and intracloud interference. The optimization problem maximizes the overall network utilization under practical network constraints. Further, this paper also proposes a low complexity heuristic algorithm to solve the constraint resource allocation problem in linear time. Complexity analysis of proposed algorithm is carried out and simulations results for a number of IoT network scenarios demonstrate that proposed solution is numerically accurate and performs close to the optimal solution. © 2014 IEEE.},

Simultaneous pickup occurs only if the heads in the beam are aligned with the feeders and the nozzle-types on these heads match with the component-types on the feeders. In order to minimise the assembly cycle time, the optimisation problem is decomposed into two sub-problems, the pickup combination and sequencing problem, and the placement cluster and sequencing problem. These two sub-problems are simultaneously solved by the proposed hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA). The pickup combination and sequencing problem is similar to the popular multi-compartment vehicle routing problem (MCVRP); a genetic algorithm (GA) for the MCVRP is therefore modified and applied to solving the pickup combination and sequencing problem. A greedy heuristic algorithm is used to solve the placement cluster and sequencing problem. The numerical experiments reveal that the HGA outperforms the algorithms proposed by previous papers. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The no-wait job shop scheduling problem is a well-known NP-hard problem and it is typically decomposed into timetabling subproblem and sequencing subproblem. By adopting favorable features of the group search technique, a hybrid discrete group search optimizer is proposed for finding high quality schedules in the no-wait job shops with the total flow time criterion. In order to find more promising sequences, the producer operator is designed as a destruction and construction (DC) procedure and an insertion-based local search, the scrounger operator is implemented by differential evolution scheme, and the ranger operator is designed by hybridizing best insert moves. An efficient initialization scheme based on Nawaz–Enscore–Ham (NEH) heuristic is designed to construct the initial population with both quality and diversity. A speed-up method is developed to accelerate the evaluation of the insertion neighborhood. Computational results based on well-known benchmark instances show that the proposed algorithm clearly outperforms a hybrid differential evolution algorithm and an iterated greedy algorithm. In addition, the proposed algorithm is comparable to a local search method based on optimal job insertion, especially for large-size instances. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {As cloud computing is a market-oriented utility, optimal virtual machine (VM) scheduling in cloud computing should take into account the incentives for both cloud users and the cloud provider. However, most of existing studies on VM scheduling only consider the incentive for one party, i.e., either the cloud users or the cloud provider. Very few related studies consider the incentives for both parties, in which the cost, one of the most attractive incentives for cloud users, is not well addressed. In this paper, we investigate the problem of VM scheduling in cloud computing by optimizing the incentives for both parties. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization model, i.e., maximizing the successful execution rate of VM requests and minimizing the combined cost (incentives for cloud users), and minimizing the fairness deviation of profits (incentive for the cloud provider). The proposed multi-objective optimization model can offer sufficient incentives for the two parties to stay and play in the cloud and keep the cloud system sustainable. A heuristic-based scheduling algorithm, called cost-greedy dynamic price scheduling, is then developed to optimize the incentives for both parties. Experimental results show that, compared with some popular algorithms, the developed algorithm can achieve higher successful execution rate, lower execution cost, smaller fairness deviation and most important, higher degree of user satisfaction in most cases. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Edge computing enables users to offload certain computation loads in complex applications to a nearby network consisting of multiple mobile devices such that the mobile devices’ resources can be integrated to afford these complex applications. Due to the social relationships among the owners of mobile devices, networks in edge computing are always complex and consist of multiple sub-networks intersecting at several joint devices. In such complex networks, a joint device can communicate with all devices belonging to all sub-networks that intersect at this joint device while a general device can only communicate with the devices belonging to the same sub-network. This paper studies the makespan-minimization workflow scheduling problem for the aforementioned complex networks in edge computing environments, and formulates the problem as an integer program. Due to the limited energy capacity of each device, the dependence among workflow tasks, as well as network complexity, it is challenging to achieve feasible scheduling solutions for the concerned problem. Therefore, we propose a family of task allocation strategies to cope with different types of tasks in the workflow. These strategies are further integrated with a greedy strategy to construct an improved greedy search (IGS) algorithm which is capable of generating feasible solutions satisfying all constraints. In addition, we propose an improved composite heuristic (ICH) algorithm that employs IGS to initialize a feasible solution and uses a two-layer improvement scheme to further enhance the quality of the initial solution. Simulation results show that our proposed IGS achieves an 100% probability of generating feasible solutions, as compared to a 2.3% probability achieved by using the general round-robin scheduling algorithm. Furthermore, IGS and ICH outperform the counterpart scheduling algorithms in terms of makespan reduction. © 2020},

Uncertainties in surgeries duration, in the arrivals of emergency surgeries and in surgeons’ capacity are considered. To solve the problem we propose a Monte Carlo optimization method based on the sample average approximation method, which combines an iterative greedy local search method and Monte Carlo simulation. The performance of the iterative greedy local search method is evaluated against an exact method and two existing heuristic methods for solving the deterministic version of the problem, using testbeds generated based on the literature. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to evaluate the performance of the Monte Carlo optimization method in a stochastic setting. The results show that the objective function value converges with exponential rates when the number of samples increases, obtaining an optimality index value around 1 %. By comparing the results against the solution obtained by the corresponding deterministic expected value problem, we conclude that an important cost reduction can be obtained by solving the stochastic problem rather than the deterministic one. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Recently, the authors have proposed a scalable holistic scheduling approach for time-triggered applications on FlexRay, under end-to-end deadline and data dependency constraints. This approach divides the problem to two sub-problems that can be solved separately. The first sub-problem optimally schedules the set of messages to minimize number of used slots, and with respect to information exchanges between tasks and messages, end-to-end deadlines and FlexRay protocol constraints. The second sub-problem optimally schedules the set of tasks to minimize tasks response times, with respect to the solution returned by the first sub-problem. In this paper, our goal is to increase the scalability of our solution to each sub-problem. We propose a greedy heuristic approach for the first sub-problem that can find feasible solutions at a low runtime cost. In addition, to resolve assignment conflicts, we apply rescheduling the conflicted application with offset modification and priority promotion procedures. Furthermore, we show that the task scheduling in the second sub-problem can be divided into K independent child sub-problems, where K is the number of ECUs. Our experiments show high scalability and efficiency of our approaches comparing with our optimization-based approaches in the previous work. © 2019, KSAE.},

	abstract = {In the classic distributed permutation flowshop scheduling problem (DPFSP), jobs are viewed as individual entities and processed independently. In many practical cases, however, a number of jobs actually come from the same customer order. Under this circumstance, it may be sensible to process jobs from the same customer order in a single factory to reduce transportation costs, paperwork and management burden. This study introduces the customer order constraint into the DPFSP. In our problem, a set of customer orders need to be manufactured in a number of factories and each order composed of some defined jobs should be processed in the same factory. The objective is to minimize the maximum completion time or makespan among factories. At first, we build a mathematical model to formulate this new problem. Then, given the NP-hardness of this problem, we present three heuristics exploring three rules for generating the seed job sequence as well as two rules for assigning orders to factories. Besides, we develop three meta-heuristics, namely, a variable neighborhood descent (ORVND), an artificial bee colony (ORABC) and an iterated greedy (ORIG). Effective mechanisms are suggested to improve the performance, including an order-insertion based neighborhood search and a greedy reinsertion strategy for ORVND, a two-level search scheme and a multi-neighbor scheme for ORABC, and the improved destruction, reconstruction and local search operations for ORIG. Finally, extensive experiments based on famous benchmarks are performed and numerical comparisons validate the high effectiveness of presented algorithms for the considered problem. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Resource constrained job scheduling problems are ubiquitous in real-world logistics and supply chain management. By solving these optimisation problems, organisations can efficiently utilise logistical resources and improve delivery performance. Because of their complexity, finding optimal solution is challenging. Existing solution methods based on integer programming and meta-heuristics have shown promising results for small instances but become less efficient when they are applied to large-scale instances with hundreds of jobs. This paper presents a new hybrid optimisation method that combines the power of differential evolution, iterated greedy search, mixed integer programming, and parallel computing to solve resource constrained job scheduling problems. The experimental results with existing benchmark datasets and a set of 1755 newly generated instances show that the proposed algorithm can find high quality solutions even for hard instances. For small and medium instances, the optimality gaps of the proposed algorithms are significantly better than those of the mixed integer programming solver and the column generation algorithm. For large instances, the proposed algorithms can find solutions with significantly better upper bounds as compared to existing meta-heuristics and the state-of-the-art hybrid algorithm. The analyses also confirm the advantage of using multiple processing cores to improve the efficiency and solution quality of the proposed algorithm. © 2019},

We consider the Home Healthcare Nurse Scheduling Problem where patients arrive dynamically over time and acceptance and appointment time decisions have to be made as soon as patients arrive. The objective is to maximise the average number of daily visits for a single nurse. For the sake of service continuity, patients have to be visited at the same day and time each week during their episode of care. We propose a new heuristic based on generating several scenarios which include randomly generated and actual requests in the schedule, scheduling new customers with a simple but fast heuristic, and analysing results to decide whether to accept the new patient and at which appointment day/time. We compare our approach with two greedy heuristics from the literature, and empirically demonstrate that it achieves significantly better results compared to these other two methods. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Shift Minimization Personnel Task Scheduling Problem (SMPTSP) is assigning a given set of predetermined tasks (with known start and finish times) to a minimum number of heterogeneous workers with predetermined shifts. Each task can be performed only by a specific subset of workers. Every task must be assigned to a worker. A worker cannot perform more than one task at a time, and tasks cannot be pre-empted. SMPTSP is NP-hard, but there is practical interest in solving very large instances of it in ground crew scheduling of a large airline in a large airport. Recently, there have been a few papers reporting various solution methods for large instances of SMPTSP. However, solving very large instances of SMPTSP remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel greedy heuristic solution method for SMPTSP. A reduced problem is solved iteratively by selecting the best possible assignment of tasks to one worker. We have tested the Greedy heuristic method on 3 sets of available large test problems. The results show that the heuristic method performs well relative to the current solution methods, and has the added advantage of being able to solve very large instances fast. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper introduces an efficient algorithm for the bike request scheduling problem (BRSP). The BRSP is built around the concept of request, defined as the pickup or dropoff of a number of identical items (bikes) at a specific station, within a certain time window, and with a certain priority. The aim of the BRSP is to sequence requests on (and hence determine the routes of) a set of vehicles, in such a way that the sum of the priorities of the executed requests is maximized, all time windows are respected, and the capacity of the vehicles is not exceeded. The generation of the set of requests is explicitly not a part of the problem definition of the BRSP. The primary application of the BRSP, from which it derives its name, is to determine the routes of a set of repositioning vehicles in a bike sharing system, although other applications exist. The algorithm introduced in this paper is based on a set of related greedy randomized adaptive search procedure followed by variable neighborhood descent (GRASP + VND) operators embedded in a large neighborhood search (LNS) framework. Since this paper presents the first heuristic for the BRSP, a computational comparison to existing approaches is not possible. We therefore compare the solutions found by our LNS heuristic to those found by an exact solver (Gurobi). These experiments confirm that the proposed algorithm scales to realistic dimensions and is able to find near-optimal solutions in seconds. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {Due to its practical relevance, the hybrid flowshop scheduling problem (HFSP) has been widely studied in the literature with the objectives related to production efficiency. However, studies regarding energy consumption and environmental effects have rather been limited. This paper addresses the trade-off between makespan and total energy consumption in hybrid flowshops, where machines can operate at varying speed levels. A bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model and a bi-objective constraint programming (CP) model are proposed for the problem employing speed scaling. Since the objectives of minimizing makespan and total energy consumption are conflicting with each other, the augmented epsilon (ε)-constraint approach is used for obtaining the Pareto-optimal solutions. While close approximations for the Pareto-optimal frontier are obtained for small-sized instances, sets of non-dominated solutions are obtained for large instances by solving the MILP and CP models under a time limit. As the problem is NP-hard, two variants of the iterated greedy algorithm, a variable block insertion heuristic and four variants of ensemble of metaheuristic algorithms are also proposed, as well as a novel constructive heuristic. The performances of the proposed seven bi-objective metaheuristics are compared with each other as well as the MILP and CP solutions on a set of well-known HFSP benchmarks in terms of cardinality, closeness, and diversity of the solutions. Initially, the performances of the algorithms are tested on small-sized instances with respect to the Pareto-optimal solutions. Then, it is shown that the proposed algorithms are very effective for solving large instances in terms of both solution quality and CPU time. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

To help address the link between sustainment policies and acquisition, this work develops a greedy heuristic-based local search algorithm (GHLSA) to provide a system maintenance schedule for multi-component systems, coordinating recommended component maintenance times to reduce system downtime costs, thereby enabling effective acquisition. The proposed iterative algorithm aims to minimize the sum of downtime, earliness and tardiness costs of scheduling, which contains three phases: (1) the construction phase, which uses a heuristic to construct an initial partial solution, (2) an improvement phase, which aims to improve the partial solution generated in the construction phase, and finally, (3) a local search phase, which performs a local search technique to the partial solution found in the improvement phase. The proposed algorithm makes a trade-off between exploration and exploitation of solutions. The experimental results for small (10 jobs) and large size (50 jobs) problems indicate that GHLSA outperforms both genetic algorithm and simulated annealing approaches in terms of solution quality and is similar in terms of efficiency. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

The main challenges for such large-scale systems are energy consumption, computing node CPU-GPU utilization dynamic variability, and so on. In response to these challenges, this study first provides heterogeneous computing systems architecture and parallel application job model. Then, we build system computing node CPU-GPU utilization model and analyze job execution energy consumption. We also deduce the optimal CPU-GPU utilization and job deadline scheduling constraint. Third, we propose a systems CPU-GPU utilization aware and energy-efficient heuristic greedy strategy (UEJS) to solve this job scheduling problem. To improve the algorithm global optimization ability, we design a hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm (H-PSO), which incorporates the heuristic greedy strategy into the bio-inspired search optimization technique. The rigorous experimental results clearly demonstrate that our proposed H-PSO outperforms heuristic greedy strategy, Max-EAMin, and Genetic Algorithm in terms of the average energy consumption of jobs and system job rejection rate. In particular, H-PSO is better than UEJS by 36.5%, Max-EAMin by 36.3%, and GA by 46.7% in term of the job average energy consumption for heterogeneous system with high workload. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses a novel distributed assembly permutation flowshop scheduling problem that has important applications in modern supply chains and manufacturing systems. The problem considers a number of identical factories, each one consisting of a flowshop for part-processing plus an assembly line for product-processing. The objective is to minimize the makespan. To suit the needs of different CPU time and solution quality, we present a mixed integer linear model, three constructive heuristics, two variable neighborhood search methods, and an iterated greedy algorithm. Important problem-specific knowledge is obtained to enhance the effectiveness of the algorithms. Accelerations for evaluating solutions are proposed to save computational efforts.

	abstract = {We study a setting where Electric Vehicles (EVs) can be hired to drive from pick-up to drop-off points in a Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) scheme. The goal of the system is, either to maximize the number of customers that are serviced, or the total EV utilization. To do so, we characterise the optimisation problem as a max-flow problem in order to determine the set of feasible trips given the available EVs at each location. We then model and solve the EV-to-trip scheduling problem offline and optimally using Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) techniques and show that the solution scales up to medium sized problems. Given this, we develop two non-optimal algorithms, namely an incremental-MIP algorithm for medium to large problems and a greedy heuristic algorithm for very large problems. Moreover, we develop a tabu search-based local search technique to further improve upon and compare against the solution of the non-optimal algorithms. We study the performance of these algorithms in settings where either battery swap or battery charge at each station is used to cope with the EVs' limited driving range. Moreover, in settings where EVs need to be scheduled online, we propose a novel algorithm that accounts for the uncertainty in future trip requests. All algorithms are empirically evaluated using real-world data of locations of shared vehicle pick-up and drop-off stations. In our experiments, we observe that when all EVs carry the same battery which is large enough for the longest trips, the greedy algorithm with battery swap with the max-flow solution as a pre-processing step, provides the optimal solution. At the same time, the greedy algorithm with battery charge is close to the optimal (97% on average) and is further improved when local search is used. When some EVs do not have a large enough battery to execute some of the longest trips, the incremental-MIP generates solutions slightly better than the greedy, while the optimal algorithm is the best but scales up to medium sized problems only. Moreover, the online algorithm is shown to be on average at least 90% of the optimal. Finally, the greedy algorithm scales to 10-times more tasks than the incremental-MIP and 1000-times more than the static MIP in reasonable time. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The distributed production lines widely exist in modern supply chains and manufacturing systems. This paper aims to address the distributed no-wait flow shop scheduling problem (DNWFSP) with the makespan criterion by using proposed iterated greedy (IG) algorithms. Firstly, several speed-up methods based on the problem properties of DNWFSP are investigated to reduce the evaluation time of neighborhood with O(1) complexity. Secondly, an improved NEH heuristic is proposed to generate a promising initial solution, where the iteration step of the insertion step of NEH is applied to the factory after inserting a new job. Thirdly, four neighborhood structures (i.e. Critical_swap_single, Critical_insert_single, Critical_swap_multi, Critical_insert_multi) based on factory assignment and job sequence adjustment are employed to escape from local optima. Fourthly, four local search methods based on neighborhood moves are proposed to enhance local searching ability, which contains LS_insert_critical_factory1, LS_insert_critical_factory2, LS_swap, and LS_insert. Finally, to organize neighborhood moves and local search methods efficiently, we incorporate them into the framework of variable neighborhood search (VNS), variable neighborhood descent (VND) and random neighborhood structure (RNS). Furthermore, three variants of IG algorithms are presented based on the designed VNS, VND and RNS. The parameters of the proposed IG algorithms are tuned through a design of experiments on randomly generated benchmark instances. The effectiveness of the initialize phase and local search methods is shown by numerical comparison, and the comparisons with the recently published algorithms demonstrate the high effectiveness and searching ability of the proposed IG algorithms for solving the DNWFSP. Ultimately, the best solutions of 720 instances from the well-known benchmark set of Naderi and Ruiz for the DNWFSP are proposed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In networked systems, monitoring devices such as sensors are typically deployed to monitor various target locations. Targets are the points in the physical space at which events of some interest, such as random faults or attacks, can occur. Most often, monitoring devices have limited energy supplies, and they can operate for a limited duration. As a result, energy-efficient monitoring of target locations through a set of monitoring devices with limited energy supplies is a crucial problem in networked systems. In this paper, we study optimal scheduling of monitoring devices to maximize network coverage for detecting and isolating events on targets for a given network lifetime. The monitoring devices considered could remain active only for a fraction of the overall network lifetime. We formulate the problem of scheduling of monitoring devices as a graph labeling problem, which unlike other existing solutions, allows us to directly utilize the underlying network structure to explore the trade-off between coverage and network lifetime. In this direction, first we present a greedy heuristic, and then a game-theoretic solution to the graph labeling problem. The proposed setup can be used to simultaneously solve the scheduling and placement of monitoring devices, which, as our simulations illustrate, gives improved performance as compared to separately solving the placement and scheduling problems. Finally, we illustrate our results on various networks, including real-world water distribution networks and random geometric networks. © 2013 IEEE.},

For the validation of this hypothesis, six neighborhood structures are proposed, considering the characteristics of the problem for reducing the search space exploitation. The analysis is carried out considering three VND variations, two neighborhood structures exploitation order, as well as exploitation by the First Improvement and Best Improvement methods. The Taguchi Robust Parameter method is used to design a specific configuration of the VND for each metaheuristic. Additionally, some experiments to analyze the contribution of each neighborhood structure for the convergence of the metaheuristics are performed. The results show that three neighborhood structures, act together, and domain the convergence influence of the local search. The results also show that the use of VND as a local search operator in place of those original local search increases the performance of all metaheuristics evaluated. Moreover, the results achieved by the metaheuristics integrated to the VND in the most evaluated scenarios have become equivalent or better, on average, than state-of-the-art approaches. © 2020},

In this system, we group jobs into families such that jobs within a family have similar processing requirements. Hence, no scheduled setup exists between any two jobs of the same family. However, a sequence-independent setup time occurs between families. The problem is of practical interest for industries such as plastic manufacturing and metal drawing operations, which often employ a GT setup. This problem has been discussed in the academic literature and shown to be NP-hard. However, no solution methods have been proposed in the literature. To solve this NP-hard problem, we develop a hybrid heuristic based on greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) meta-heuristics. We conduct extensive experiments with respect to problem size and parameter settings. We benchmark the performance of the hybrid heuristic with a simple GRASP application as well as with optimal solutions. Overall, results show the hybrid heuristic performs very well, finding optimal solutions for 63% of the problem instances. © 2017 The Authors.

	abstract = {Considering the "furnace-caster matching" modes, this paper focuses on the scheduling problems from practical steelmaking-continuous casting production lacking refining span. Aiming at the improvement on quality and output of steel products, a mathematical model is established with multi-objective optimization including the minimum earliness/tardiness of starting cast times, the shortest waiting times of heats among different processes and the shortest idle times of converters. A heuristic algorithm based on the optimization of "furnace-caster matching" mode is developed to solve this model, which involves two procedures of device assignment and conflict elimination. Through the detailed analysis on workshop layout and production rhythm, four classes of matching modes of "refining furnace-caster" are proposed to perform the assignments of refining furnaces. The assignments of converters rely on three categories of greedy strategies in terms of minimizing conflictions among heats. A rough scheduling solution with some possible conflicts among heats is obtained through combining "furnace-caster matching" modes and greedy strategies. Then applying the linear programming method to eliminate the conflicts and generate the final solution. Based on the proposed algorithm and the improved genetic algorithms, simulation experiments are carried out by introducing actual production plans as instances. The results indicate that heuristic algorithm based on the optimization of "furnace-caster matching" mode is the right candidate owing to its acceptable scheduling solutions with the better process matching relations and the highlighted performances under crane constraint. Currently, the proposed model and algorithm have been successfully used in a large converter steel plant in China. © 2020 Iron and Steel Institute of Japan. All rights reserved.},

In addition, this paper proposes a cache placement algorithm based on heuristic greedy algorithm to solve this energy efficiency optimization problem by optimizing cache placement. Finally, the simulation results show the performance of the scheme. This paper proposes a content clustering distribution scheme for the problems of random user distribution and limited cache. This solution uses the user's media cloud and communication technology to complete the distribution of video content. In addition, the use of an efficient adaptive media cloud clustering mechanism and a minimized hops algorithm has enabled the reasonable deployment of 5G network caches based on the popularity of video content and user distribution. The simulation results show that the system content request response time is shortened by 50%, which effectively reduce the impact of content popularity changes on system performance.

	abstract = {Nearly all bitrate adaptive video content delivered today is streamed using protocols that run a purely client based adaptation logic. The resulting lack of coordination may lead to suboptimal user experience and resource utilization. As a response, approaches that include the network and servers in the adaptation process are emerging. In this article, we present an optimized solution for network assisted adaptation specifically targeted to mobile streaming in multi-access edge computing (MEC) environments. Due to NP-Hardness of the problem, we have designed a heuristic-based algorithm with minimum need for parameter tuning and having relatively low complexity. We then study the performance of this solution against two popular client-based solutions, namely Buffer-Based Adaptation (BBA) and Rate-Based Adaptation (RBA), as well as to another network assisted solution. Our objective is two fold: First, we want to demonstrate the efficiency of our solution and second to quantify the benefits of network-assisted adaptation over the client-based approaches in mobile edge computing scenarios. The results from our simulations reveal that the network assisted adaptation clearly outperforms the purely client-based DASH heuristics in some of the metrics, not all of them, particularly, in situations when the achievable throughput is moderately high or the link quality of the mobile clients does not differ from each other substantially. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A colored traveling salesman problem (CTSP) is a generalization of the well-known multiple traveling salesman problem. In our prior CTSP, each salesman is allocated a particular color and each city, carrying 1, 2, or all salesmen's colors depending on the problem types, allows any salesmen with the same color to visit exactly once. This paper presents a more common CTSP, in which city colors are diverse, i.e., each city has one to all salesmen's colors while other elements of the problem keeps unchanged. It is a generalization of the existing CTSPs, i.e., the radial and serial ones, and can be used to model the scheduling problems with different accessibility of jobs toward executors. A city color matrix is introduced to describe the accessibility difference of cities to all salesmen. Since CTSP is NP-hard, this paper presents a variable neighborhood search (VNS) approach, instead of computationally intractable exact solutions. First, the repetitive solution space due to the dual-chromosome encoding for the prior genetic algorithms can be entirely avoided by using direct-route encoding. Then, a two-stage greedy initialization algorithm is utilized by VNS to generate the initial solution. A city removal mechanism and a reinsertion operation are introduced to change the neighborhood space of the current solution and 2-opt method is adopted for the local search. Extensive simulation is conducted and the results show that the proposed VNS is an efficient heuristics to solve CTSP. © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {MapReduce, a parallel computational model, has been widely used in processing big data in a distributed cluster. Consisting of alternate map and reduce phases, MapReduce has to shuffle the intermediate data generated by mappers to reducers. The key challenge of ensuring balanced workload on MapReduce is to reduce partition skew among reducers without detailed distribution information on mapped data. In this paper, we propose an incremental data allocation approach to reduce partition skew among reducers on MapReduce. The proposed approach divides mapped data into many micro-partitions and gradually gathers the statistics on their sizes in the process of mapping. The micropartitions are then incrementally allocated to reducers in multiple rounds. We propose to execute incremental allocation in two steps, micro-partition scheduling and micro-partition allocation. We propose a Markov decision process (MDP) model to optimize the problem of multiple-round micropartition scheduling for allocation commitment. We present an optimal solution with the time complexity of O(K · N2), in which K represents the number of allocation rounds and N represents the number of micro-partitions. Alternatively, we also present a greedy but more efficient algorithm with the time complexity of O(K · N ln N). Then, we propose a minmax programming model to handle the allocation mapping between micro-partitions and reducers, and present an effective heuristic solution due to its NP-completeness. Finally, we have implemented the proposed approach on Hadoop, an open-source MapReduce platform, and empirically evaluated its performance. Our extensive experiments show that compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed approach achieves considerably better data load balance among reducers as well as overall better parallel performance. © 2018, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Each block is analyzed individually in order to define the best target period. This methodology presents an improvement of the classical methodology derived from Lerchs-Grossmann’s initial proposition improved by Whittle. This paper presents the differences between these methodologies, specially focused on the algorithms’ avidity. Avidity is classically defined by the voracious search algorithms, whereupon some of the most famous greedy algorithms are Branch and Bound, Brutal Force and Randomized. Strategies based on heuristics can accentuate the voracity of the optimizer system. The applied algorithm use simulated annealing combined with Tabu Search. The most avid algorithm can select the most profitable blocks in early periods, leading to higher present value in the first periods of mine operation. The application of discount factors to blocks on the Lerchs-Grossmann’s final pit has an accentuated effect with time, and this effect may make blocks scheduled for the end of the mine life unfeasible, representing a trend to a decrease in reported reserves. © 2018, Escola de Minas.

Quality-of-service requirements of hotspot users as well as macrocell users are considered in the optimization problem.

	abstract = {Resource leveling is important in project management as resource fluctuations are costly and undesired. Typically, schedules with better resource profiles are obtained by shifting the activities within their float times using the schedule of fixed duration found by Critical Path Method. However, if the project duration can be extended, it is plausible to find a schedule with enhanced resource leveling since a longer duration allows for more float time for all activities. In this work, we relax the assumption of fixed durations in resource leveling formulations and investigate what the minimal project duration for the best leveled schedule should be. We provide mixed-integer linear models for several leveling objectives including the Release and Rehire metric. We show that not all metrics used for leveling under fixed durations may be appropriate when the project duration becomes a decision variable. Optimal solutions from smaller problems are used to find the magnitude of the extension needed and benefits obtained thereby. Since the problem is a NP-hard problem for which exact solutions cannot be obtained for large networks in reasonable time, we provide a greedy heuristic to be used with the Release and Rehire metric. Using an iterative framework, we also test the performance of a state-of-the-art heuristic algorithm from the literature on our problem. Computational experiments indicate that the more the number of resources is increased, the less leveling benefits are gained from extending the project. The optimal project durations and extension benefits can also be significantly different for different metrics. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {We consider the real-time resolution of conflicts arising in real-world train management applications. In particular, given a nominal timetable for a set of trains and a set of modifications due to delays or other resources unavailability, we are aiming at defining a set of actions which must be implemented to grant safety, e.g., to avoid potential conflicts such as train collisions or headway violations, and restore quality by reducing the delays. To be compatible with real-time management, the required actions must be determined in a few seconds, hence specialized fast heuristics must be used. We propose a fast and effective parallel algorithm that is based on an iterated greedy scheduling of trains on a time-space network. The algorithm uses several sortings to define the initial train dispatching rule and different shaking methods between iterations. The performance is further enhanced by using various sparsification methods for the time-space network. The best algorithm configuration is determined through extensive experiments, conducted on a set of instances derived from real-world networks and instances from the literature. The resulting heuristic proved able to consistently resolve the existing conflicts and obtaining excellent solution quality within just two seconds of computing time on a standard personal computer, for instances involving up to 151 trains and two hours of planning time horizon. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study addresses the problem of scheduling magnetic resonance imaging examinations to reduce indirect waiting time—that is, the time that elapses between the patient’s call for an appointment and the scheduled appointment time. Two alternative scheduling approaches are proposed: online and offline characterized, respectively, by the absence or presence of a batch of patients waiting for an appointment. Specifically, with an online approach, patients are scheduled when they call for an appointment, and consequently there is no need to have a batch of patients. On the contrary, the offline approach assumes that patients are given an expected waiting time when they call; they are subsequently called back and assigned an appointment within few days. With an offline approach, patients are thus collected in a batch until a scheduling policy is run; clearly, the batch size or equivalently the frequency according to which patients are scheduled impacts on the performance of the scheduling policy. The offline approach allows a better planning with respect to the online approach where the decision regarding a patient is greatly affected by the schedule of patients who called before him. On the other side, the online approach allows a prompt accommodation of the patient. In an attempt at trade-off these two approaches, the offline one is experimented with three different scheduling frequencies: once per week, two times per week, and three times per week. The paper describes a novel MIP model for implementation of the offline approach and a greedy heuristic for implementation of the online one. Online and offline approaches are then compared in terms of effectiveness, equity, efficiency and discrimination power, using a rolling horizon of 52 weeks and assuming different demand patterns. The comparison includes an evaluation of the impact of two managerial practices—examination overlapping and radiologist cross-training—when using the two forms of scheduling. The key findings are that the offline approach achieves smaller, less variable values for tardiness and enables scheduling of a higher number of patients in situations where capacity is scarce. As to managerial practices, overlapping is found to be relatively more effective than cross-training when an offline approach is adopted, while for online scheduling, cross-training is more effective than overlapping. The results presented are based on an extensive experimental campaign based on real data coming from a leading Italian hospital. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the management of a large number of distributed battery energy storage systems (BESSs) by a energy utility in order to provide some market services. A heuristic algorithm based on two parts is proposed for this task. The first part, the aggregation, combines the abilities and behavior of the fleet of BESS into a virtual power plant (VPP) by a concise but flexible model. This VPP can be used by the utility as they are used to with traditional power plants. The second part, the disaggregation, distributes VPP control schedules back to the individual BESS by a greedy first-fit decreasing heuristic. The management of a fleet of BESS can also be modeled as a mathematical linear optimization program. The proposed heuristic is compared to and evaluated against this global optimization regarding computational performance and quality of results. It is shown, that the heuristic provides a remarkable speedup when applied to larger number of units. With it, it is possible to handle a group of at least 100,000 individual BESS. Further, the quality of the results are shown. First, the solution of the heuristic is compared to the optimal one of the mathematical program. Second, the methods are both applied and compared in a realistic case study. © 2018, The Author(s).},

Inspired by the overall process of biogeography theory, the standard biogeography-based optimization (BBO) was constructed with migration and mutation operators. In this paper, a hybrid biogeography-based optimization with variable neighborhood search (HBV) is implemented for solving the NWFSP with the makespan criterion. The modified NEH and the nearest neighbor mechanism are employed to generate a potential initial population. A hybrid migration operator, which combines the path relink technique and the block-based self-improvement strategy, is designed to accelerate the convergence speed of HBV. The iterated greedy (IG) algorithm is introduced into the mutation operator to obtain a promising solution in exploitation phase. A variable neighbor search strategy, which is based on the block neighborhood structure and the insert neighborhood structure, is designed to perform the local search around the current best solution in each generation.

	abstract = {The advent of 5G technologies enables highly anticipated prospect of the internet of things in smart cities. Smart terminals become a necessity with increasing number of applications and tasks. The limited computational resources and constrained battery energy at terminals compel tasks to be offloaded for execution sometimes. For time-sensitive and safety-critical tasks, fog computing is the preferred option instead of cloud computing, since fog computing brings the computing resources to the edge of networks and thus has shorter response latency. In this context, vehicular fog computing (VFC) that supplements fog computing by contributing vehicular computing resources has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, a few of challenging issues regarding task offloading in VFC still need to be addressed. For example, decision making for task allocation and response latency optimization are not straightforward, since on one hand the connection between vehicles and end users is usually short or intermittent; on the other hand the multi-hop inter-vehicle task forwarding is time-consuming and thus prone to packet loss. To address the latency related issue, we in this paper propose a three-layer architecture of VFC to schedule the tasks offloaded from mobile devices (MDs). The road side unit (RSU) is endowed with computing facilities and storing resources such that it can act as not only a gateway to the remote cloud center but also a centralized infrastructure responsible for task scheduling among vehicles. A greedy heuristic based scheduling strategy and algorithms are proposed in the next. Last, an extensive series of experiments are carried out to investigate the proposed scheduling strategy. The results show that the proposed scheduling strategy outperforms other well known heuristics based scheduling strategies such as Min-Min and Max-Min and thus has wide prospects.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) is considered as an important problem in the modern manufacturing system. It is known to be an NP-hard problem. Most of the algorithms used in solving FJSP problem are categorized as metaheuristic methods. Some of these methods normally consume more CPU time and some other methods are more complicated which make them difficult to code and not easy to reproduce. This paper proposes a modified iterated greedy (IG) algorithm to deal with FJSP problem in order to provide a simpler metaheuristic, which is easier to code and to reproduce than some other much more complex methods. This is done by separating the classical IG into two phases. Each phase is used to solve a sub-problem of the FJSP: sequencing and routing sub-problems. A set of dispatching rules are employed in the proposed algorithm for the sequencing and machine selection in the construction phase of the solution. To evaluate the performance of proposed algorithm, some experiments including some famous FJSP benchmarks have been conducted. By compared with other algorithms, the experimental results show that the presented algorithm is competitive and able to find global optimum for most instances. The simplicity of the proposed IG provides an effective method that is also easy to apply and consumes less CPU time in solving the FJSP problem. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The smart vehicles construct Internet of Vehicle (IoV), which can execute various intelligent services. Although the computation capability of a vehicle is limited, multi-type of edge computing nodes provide heterogeneous resources for intelligent vehicular services. When offloading the complex service to the vehicular edge computing node, the decision for its destination should be considered according to numerous factors. This paper mostly formulate the offloading decision as a resource scheduling problem with single or multiple objective function and constraints, where some customized heuristics algorithms are explored. However, offloading multiple data dependence tasks in a complex service is a difficult decision, as an optimal solution must understand the resource requirement, the access network, the user mobility, and importantly the data dependence. Inspired by recent advances in machine learning, we propose a knowledge driven (KD) service offloading decision framework for IoV, which provides the optimal policy directly from the environment. We formulate the offloading decision for the multiple tasks as a long-term planning problem, and explore the recent deep reinforcement learning to obtain the optimal solution. It can scruple the future data dependence of the following tasks when making decision for a current task from the learned offloading knowledge. Moreover, the framework supports the pre-training at the powerful edge computing node and continually online learning when the vehicular service is executed, so that it can adapt the environment changes and can learn policy that are sensible in foresight. The simulation results show that KD service offloading decision converges quickly, adapts to different conditions, and outperforms a greedy offloading decision algorithm. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The permutation flowshop scheduling problem (PFSP) has been extensively explored in scheduling literature because it has many real-world industrial implementations. In some studies, multiple objectives related to production efficiency have been considered simultaneously. However, studies that consider energy consumption and environmental impacts are very rare in a multi-objective setting. In this work, we studied two contradictory objectives, namely, total flowtime and total energy consumption (TEC) in a green permutation flowshop environment, in which the machines can be operated at varying speed levels corresponding to different energy consumption values. A bi-objective mixed-integer programming model formulation was developed for the problem using a speed-scaling framework. To address the conflicting objectives of minimizing TEC and total flowtime, the augmented epsilon-constraint approach was employed to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions. We obtained near approximations for the Pareto-optimal frontiers of small-scale problems using a very small epsilon level. Furthermore, the mathematical model was run with a time limit to find sets of non-dominated solutions for large instances. As the problem was NP-hard, two effective multi-objective iterated greedy algorithms and a multi-objective variable block insertion heuristic were also proposed for the problem as well as a novel construction heuristic for initial solution generation. The performance of the developed heuristic algorithms was assessed on well-known benchmark problems in terms of various quality measures. Initially, the performance of the algorithms was evaluated on small-scale instances using Pareto-optimal solutions. Then, it was shown that the developed algorithms are tremendously effective for solving large instances in comparison to time-limited model. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

So, by exchanging decoded signals of User Equipments (UEs) among sinks through the backbones, more interferences to undecoded signals could be cancelled further. Thus, potential optimization rooms for reducing access delays are provided. In this paper, we study the problem of minimum uplink scheduling for Backbone-Assisted Successive Interference Cancellation-based Wireless Networks (BASICWNs), so as to reduce the mean access delays of UEs. We formulate the problem, and prove that it is NP-Complete by presenting a reduction from the partition problem. We further propose a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm based on the greedy strategy that as many UEs as possible are simultaneously scheduled in one slot. Experimental results show, relative to that with multiple independent sinks, the uplink frame length of BASICWNs is reduced by 48% with the heuristic algorithm proposed, and the performance is virtually very close to the optimum. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This work originates from the practical requirements of video surveillance in public transport systems, where security cameras store video onboard, and a central operator occasionally needs to access portions of the recordings. When this happens, the selected video portions must be uploaded within a given deadline, using (multiple) wireless interfaces, with different costs (which correspond to, e.g., tariffs). We study this video upload problem as a scheduling problem with deadline, where our goal is to choose which interfaces to use and when, so as to minimize the cost of the upload while meeting the given deadline. Our study gives rise to adaptive schedulers that require only a very coarse knowledge of the wireless interfaces bandwidth. In this paper, we first assume an oracle has the perfect knowledge about the available bandwidth of wireless interfaces at each time, and we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the upload cost within the given deadline. Second, we propose greedy oracle-based heuristics that perform very close to optimal, and that can provide a simple baseline for performance. Third, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem, assuming only the knowledge of the distribution of available bandwidth, and, fourth, we propose adaptive schedulers, that we simulate and also implement and test in a real testbed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive solutions can effectively leverage the fundamental trade-off between upload cost and completion time, despite unpredictable variations in the available bandwidth of wireless interfaces. Experiments with real mobile nodes provided by the MONROE platform confirm the findings. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {High-Performance Computing systems rely on the software’s capability to be highly parallelized in individual computing tasks. However, even with a high parallelization level, poor scheduling can lead to long runtimes; this scheduling is in itself an NP-hard problem. Therefore, it is our interest to use a heuristic approach, particularly Cellular Processing Algorithms (CPA), which is a novel metaheuristic framework for optimization. This framework has its foundation in exploring the search space by multiple Processing Cells that communicate to exploit the search and in the individual stagnation detection mechanism in the Processing Cells. In this paper, we proposed using a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) to look for promising task execution orders; later, a CPA formed with Iterated Local Search (ILS) Processing Cells is used for the optimization. We assess our approach with a high-performance ILS state-of-the-art approach. Experimental results show that the CPA outperforms the previous ILS in real applications and synthetic instances. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {This paper studies a flexible flowshop scheduling problem with step-deteriorating jobs and sequence-dependent setup times (FFSP-SDJ&SDST) where there are multiple unrelated parallel machines at each stage. The actual processing time of each job is modeled as a step function of its starting time. An integer programming model is first formulated with the objective of minimizing the total weighted completion time. Since this problem is NP-complete, it becomes an interesting and challenging topic to develop effective approximation algorithms for solving it. The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm has been successfully applied to solve both continuous and combinatorial optimization problems with the advantages of fewer control parameters and ease of implementation. So, an improved discrete artificial bee colony algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm, a dynamic generation mechanism of initial solutions is designed based on job permutation encoding. A genetic algorithm and a modified variable neighborhood search are introduced, respectively, to obtain new solutions for the employed and onlooker bees. A greedy heuristic is proposed to generate the solutions of the scout bees. Finally, to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, an orthogonal test is performed to optimize the parameter settings. Simulation results on different scale problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more effective compared against several presented algorithms from the existing literatures. © 2019 Hua Xuan et al.},

	abstract = {Fog radio access networks (F-RANs) have recently been postulated as an innovative solution to improve the fronthaul capacities of cloud base stations (CBSs). This architecture extends the CBS service by involving enhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs), which can pre-store and transmit popular files at the network edge (i.e., close to the end users). This is referred to as caching, and it allows the offloading of CBS resources, e.g., time and frequency. Recent works have been proposed to use rate-aware network coding in order to exploit the previously downloaded popular files at the users' devices. As such, the CBS offloading is maximized. However, the users' achieved Quality of Service (QoS), and the standard F-RANs physical-layer resource optimization have not received any attention to date. This paper proposes use of an innovative cross-layer network coding (CLNC) to address the above-mentioned issues. The proposed CLNC scheme is not only aware of different users' rates but also controls the rates by jointly optimizing coding combinations, users-eRRHs/power zones (PZs) assignments, and transmission power in the PZs. Using a graph theoretical representation, we formulate the joint cross-layer CBS offloading and QoS guarantee problem and show its NP-hardness. Joint and iterative heuristic approaches are then developed to solve this problem using greedy vertex search and coloring techniques. The proposed approaches are finally validated and tested against the existing algorithms in the literature. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an approach to develop schedules for charging batteries in a battery center. This problem arises in warehouses and logistics centers that attempt to provide uninterrupted operations with battery powered machinery such as stackers. These operations often require recharging batteries on location, a process that involves two decisions: determining charging start-times and assigning batteries to chargers. Prices of grid-provided electric energy vary by hour of the day and can be almost negligible for energy available from photovoltaic solar collectors. Thus, efficient schedules should recharge batteries during time intervals with low tariffs while minimizing the time batteries spend in queue waiting for an available charger. In this situation, batteries arrive at the battery center during the operation. The model assumes that the counts of arriving batteries in time bands are known. The objective is to determine a charging schedule that minimizes a weighted sum of the costs of energy and delays. We develop a MIP model that incorporates the main features of the battery charging process. Unfortunately, computation times to solve these MIPs are too long to be practical. To overcome this limitation, we develop a constructive heuristic that finds a feasible solution in a matter of seconds, even for large-sized instances, with a relatively low GAP of 9.67%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

People defined this as the extension of the existing technologies like parallel computing, distributed computing or grid computing. Lots of research have been conducted in the field of cloud computing but the task scheduling is considered to be the most fundamental problem which is still in infancy and requires a lot of attention and a proper mechanism for the optimal utilization of the underlying computing resources. Task scheduling in cloud computing environment lies into the category of NP-hard problem and many heuristics and Meta heuristics strategies have been applied to solve the problem. Methods: In this work, Fuzzy Enabled Genetic Algorithm (FEGA) is proposed to solve the problem of task scheduling in cloud computing environment as classical roulette wheel selection method has certain limitations to solve complex optimization problem. Results & Discussion: In this work, an efficient fuzzy enabled genetic algorithm based task scheduling mechanism has been designed, implemented and investigated. The efficiency of the proposed FEGA algorithm is tested using various randomly generated data sets in different situations and compared with the other meta-heuristics.

However, minimizing total flowtime in DPFSP, a very relevant and meaningful objective for today's dynamic manufacturing environment, has not captured much attention so far. In this paper, we address the DPFSP with total flowtime criterion. To suit the needs of different CPU time demands and solution quality, we present three constructive heuristics and four metaheuristics. The constructive heuristics are based on the well-known LR and NEH heuristics. The metaheuristics are based on the high-performing frameworks of discrete artificial bee colony, scatter search, iterated local search, and iterated greedy, which have been applied with great success to closely related scheduling problems. We explore the problem-specific knowledge and accelerations to evaluate neighboring solutions for the considered problem. We introduce advanced and effective technologies like a referenced local search, a strategy to escape from local optima, and an enhanced intensive search method for the presented metaheuristics. A comprehensive computational campaign against the closely related and well performing algorithms in the literature is carried out. The results show that both the presented constructive heuristics and metaheuristics are very effective for solving the DPFSP with total flowtime criterion. © 2019},

	abstract = {An important scheduling function of manufacturing systems is controlled order release. While there exists a broad literature on order release, reported release procedures typically use simple sequencing rules and greedy heuristics to determine which jobs to select for release. While this is appealing due to its simplicity, its adequateness has recently been questioned. In response, this study uses an integer linear programming model to select orders for release to the shop floor. Using simulation, we show that optimisation has the potential to improve performance compared to ‘classical’ release based on pool sequencing rules. However, in order to also outperform more powerful pool sequencing rules, load balancing and timing must be considered at release. Existing optimisation-based release methods emphasise load balancing in periods when jobs are on time. In line with recent advances in Workload Control theory, we show that a better percentage tardy performance can be achieved by only emphasising load balancing when many jobs are urgent. However, counterintuitively, emphasising urgency in underload periods leads to higher mean tardiness. Compared to previous literature we further highlight that continuous optimisation-based release outperforms periodic optimisation-based release. This has important implications on how optimised-based release should be designed. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a new mode selection (MS) scheme for device-to-device (D2D) enabled cellular networks is proposed. The MS is carried out using a predefined signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) threshold and it aims to guarantee a minimum level of quality of service. With the new scheme, interfering effects are taken into consideration, while realistic assumptions for the acquisition of the channel information are made. Assuming a single-user case, an analytical framework is developed, which is based on the Markov-chain theory, and is used to study the system's performance. The various performance results obtained reveal that with the proposed MS, the probability of mode switching can be reduced (as compared to other systems), and thus, an increase on the overhead and signal processing is avoided. Moreover, a new approach is applied in a multi-user communication scenario, where a joint MS, resource allocation (RA), and scheduling optimization problem is formulated. The solution to this problem is based on a greedy heuristic algorithm that properly assigns the available resources among cellular users and D2D pairs. The joint MS, RA, and scheduling algorithm considers limited SINR awareness and it provides significant performance improvement in terms of sum-rate. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) have experienced a rapid growth due to the economic and environmental benefits. However, the substantial charging load brings challenging issues to the power grid. Modern technological advances and the huge number of high-rise buildings have promoted the development of distributed energy resources, such as building integrated/mounted wind turbines. The issue to coordinate EV charging with locally generated wind power of buildings can potentially reduce the impacts of EV charging demand on the power grid. As a result, this paper investigates this important problem and three contributions are made. First, the real-time scheduling of EV charging is addressed in a centralized framework based on the ideas of model predictive control, which incorporates the volatile wind power supply of buildings and the random daily driving cycles of EVs among different buildings. Second, an EV-based decentralized charging algorithm (EBDC) is developed to overcome the difficulties due to: 1) the possible lack of global information regarding the charging requirements of all EVs and 2) the computational burden with the increasing number of EVs. Third, we prove that the EBDC method can converge to the optimal solution of the centralized problem over each planning horizon. Moreover, the performance of the EBDC method is assessed through numeric comparisons with an optimal and two heuristic charging strategies (i.e., myopic and greedy). The results demonstrate that the EBDC method can achieve a satisfactory performance in improving the scalability and the balance between the EV charging demand and wind power supply of buildings. Note to Practitioners - This paper is motivated by the challenging problem due to the substantial charging load of electric vehicles (EVs) on the power grid. Nowadays, modern technological advances and the rapid increase of high-rise buildings have promoted the development of building integrated/mounted wind turbines. As the EVs are usually parked in buildings for a large proportion of time every day, the issue to best utilize locally generated wind power of buildings to suffice EV travelling requirements shows vital significance in reducing their dependence on the power grid. However, there exist two main challenges including: 1) the multiple uncertainties regarding the uncertain wind power generation and the random driving behaviors of EVs and 2) the scalability of the solution method. To tackle the first challenge, the idea of model predictive control is introduced to make charging decisions at each stage based on a short-term prediction of the on-site wind power and the current collection of EVs parked there. To consider the scalability and overcome the lack of global charging information of all EVs in practical deployment, an iterative EV-based decentralized charging algorithm (EBDC) is derived, in which each EV can dynamically update its own charging decisions according to a dynamic charging 'price' announced by the buildings. Alternatively, the buildings dynamically adjust the charging 'price' to motivate the EVs to get charged during the time periods with sufficient wind power supply. Numeric results demonstrate that the EBDC method is scalable and performs well in improving the balance between the EV charging demand and the wind power supply of buildings. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To satisfy the increasing demands of high-speed transmission, high-efficiency computing, and real-Time communications in the high-dynamic and heterogeneous networks, the Contact Plan Design (CPD) has attracted continuous attention in recent years, especially for the spatial-node-based Internet of Everything (IoE). In this paper, we study the NP-hardness of contact scheduling and the attenuation of atmospheric precipitation in the spatial-node-based IoE. Two heuristic computing methods for contact plan design are proposed by comprehensively considering the time-varying topology, the intermittent connectivity, and the adaptive transmission in different weather conditions, which are named Contact Plan Design-Particle Swarm Optimization (CPD-PSO) and Contact Plan Design-Greedy algorithm with the Minimum Delivery Time (CPD-GMDT) separately. For the population-based algorithm, CPD-PSO not only solves the CPD problem with a limited-resource condition, but also dynamically adjusts the search scope to ensure the continuous searching capability of the algorithm. For the CPD-GMDT that makes CP decisions based on the current state, the algorithm uses the idea of greedy algorithm to schedule Satellite-Platform Links (SPLs) and Inter Satellite Links (ISLs) respectively using the strategies of optimal matching and load balancing. The simulation results show that the proposed CPD-PSO outperforms Contact Plan Design-Genetic Algorithm (CPD-GA) in terms of fitness and delivery time, and CPD-GMDT presents better overall delay than Fair Contact Plan (FCP). © 2013 China Institute of Communications.},

	abstract = {When deploying radio frequency (RF)-powered sensor networks for mission-critical applications such as security surveillance, it is often required to maximize or guarantee the quality of surveillance. Both placing and scheduling the charging/working modes of sensors are of key importance in order to continuously ensure a satisfying quality of surveillance. Traditionally, sensor placement and scheduling have been considered separately. The first decision regards where to place the sensors, and then when to activate them. In this paper, we study simultaneous sensor placement and charging/working scheduling problem for fusion-based detection in RF-powered sensor networks. The problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem and proved to be NP-complete. Two greedy heuristic algorithms, joint optimization greedy algorithm with fixed fusion radius (JOGA-FFR) and joint optimization greedy algorithm with dynamic fusion radius (JOGA-DFR) based on fixed and dynamic fusion radiuses, respectively, are presented to solve the problem. We validate our approaches through extensive numerical simulations as well as simulations based on real data traces collected from a vehicle detection experiment. The results show that, our proposed algorithms always outperform two-stage greedy algorithm (TSGA), an algorithm that optimizes sensor placement and scheduling separately, in all the simulation scenarios, and are near optimal in small-scale networks. Besides, JOGA-DFR outperforms JOGA-FFR under certain specific sensing model settings, but more often has a comparable performance with JOGA-FFR. JOGA-FFR is thus more recommended for its lower complexity. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the analysis of complex stochastic dynamic programs, we often seek strong theoretical guarantees on the suboptimality of heuristic policies. One technique for obtaining performance bounds is perfect information analysis: this approach provides bounds on the performance of an optimal policy by considering a decision maker who has access to the outcomes of all future uncertainties before making decisions, that is, fully relaxed nonanticipativity constraints. A limitation of this approach is that in many problems perfect information about uncertainties is quite valuable, and thus, the resulting bound is weak. In this paper, we use an information relaxation duality approach, which includes a penalty that punishes violations of the nonanticipativity constraints, to derive stronger analytical bounds on the suboptimality of heuristic policies in stochastic dynamic programs that are too difficult to solve. The general framework we develop ties the heuristic policy and the performance bound together explicitly through the use of an approximate value function: heuristic policies are greedy with respect to this approximation, and penalties are also generated in a specific way using this approximation. We apply this approach to three challenging problems: stochastic knapsack problems, stochastic scheduling on parallel machines, and sequential search problems. In each of these problems, we consider a greedy heuristic policy generated by an approximate value function and a corresponding penalized perfect information bound. We then characterize the gap between the performance of the policy and the information relaxation bound in each problem; the results imply asymptotic optimality of the heuristic policy for specific “large” regimes of interest. © 2019 INFORMS.},

In order to be used in this problem, ACO requires modifications in the problem representation and additional mechanisms to deal with constraints. We propose a dynamic neighborhood graph and an improved method that constructs the solution that improves its exploration capability over deterministic or greedy heuristic methods. This technique has been applied to a very large real world instance of HCSP for which results are available for comparison. IACS-HCSP is able to improve the previous results on this specific instance in terms of cost. At the same time it can be used to help decision making when there is a choice between competing objectives, because it finds a full range of feasible solutions with different equilibria between time and size of the required labor force. © 2019},

This problem is a variation of the flowshop scheduling problem with job release dates that maximizes the total payoff with a stepwise job objective function. This paper contributes towards proposing a mathematical formulation for this new problem and an original constructive heuristic. Additionally, we develop a new benchmark of 300 hard instances which are available in a public repository. Besides, we provide primal and dual bounds for them. Extensive computational experiments were carried out taking into account classical constructive heuristics and hybrid local searches. Results show the merit of the FF heuristic when compared to other classical heuristics for flowshop scheduling problems. Additionally, we compare an Iterated Local Search (ILS), an Iterated Greedy Search (IGS), and a Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA), both customized for the studied problem, and a commercial mixed integer programming solver.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the problem of scheduling a set of jobs with arbitrary sizes and non-zero release times on a set of unrelated parallel batch machines with different capacities so as to minimize the total flow time of the jobs. The total flow time, defined as the total amount of time that the jobs spend in the system (i.e. the period between the job release dates and its completion times), is one of the most important objectives in scheduling problems, since it can lead to stable utilization of resources and reduction of working-in-process inventory. Motivated by the computational complexity of the problem, a simple and effective iterated greedy (IG) algorithm is proposed to solve it. The IG algorithm uses an efficient greedy heuristic to reconstruct solutions and a local search procedure to further enhance the solution quality. In attempting to obtain optimal solutions for small-medium size instances, a mixed integer programming model for the problem is also presented. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on a comprehensive set of small, medium and large benchmark of randomly generated instances, and is compared to three benchmark meta-heuristic algorithms (Discrete Differential Evolution, Ant Colony Optimization and Simulated Annealing) recently proposed for similar parallel batch machine scheduling problems. Experimental results and statistical tests show that the proposed algorithm is significantly superior in performance than the other algorithms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a variable block insertion heuristic (VBIH) algorithm to solve the permutation flow shop scheduling problem (PFSP). The VBIH algorithm removes a block of jobs from the current solution. It applies an insertion local search to the partial solution. Then, it inserts the block into all possible positions in the partial solution sequentially. It chooses the best one amongst those solutions from block insertion moves. Finally, again an insertion local search is applied to the complete solution. If the new solution obtained is better than the current solution, it replaces the current solution with the new one. As long as it improves, it retains the same block size. Otherwise, the block size is incremented by one and a simulated annealing-based acceptance criterion is employed to accept the new solution in order to escape from local minima. This process is repeated until the block size reaches its maximum size. To verify the computational results, mixed integer programming (MIP) and constraint programming (CP) models are developed and solved using very recent small VRF benchmark suite. Optimal solutions are found for 108 out of 240 instances. Extensive computational results on the VRF large benchmark suite show that the proposed algorithm outperforms two variants of the iterated greedy algorithm. 236 out of 240 instances of large VRF benchmark suite are further improved for the first time in this paper. Ultimately, we run Taillard's benchmark suite and compare the algorithms. In addition to the above, three instances of Taillard's benchmark suite are also further improved for the first time in this paper since 1993. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Using renewable energy to power roadside units (RSUs) in vehicular ad hoc networks is a desirable green alternative to the conventional electric grid, since it lowers both the carbon footprint and the cost of deployment. This paper investigates the problem of scheduling the downlink communication from renewable energy-powered RSUs toward vehicles, with the objective of maximizing the number of served vehicles. First, an offline setting is considered where the RSUs are assumed to have advance knowledge of the incoming communication requests from vehicles and of the amount of energy to be harvested. The problem is formulated as an integer linear programming model that is shown to be NP-hard and two near-optimal solutions are proposed. The first one is a greedy heuristic that prioritizes communications based on their energy cost and the second is the particle swarm optimization metaheuristic. Then, the problem is considered in an online setting and two different solution approaches are investigated. The first one assumes distributed scheduling control between RSUs and two algorithms are proposed, one based on a stochastic model and the other on simple threshold-based selection of communication requests. The second approach assumes centralized scheduling and two algorithms are also investigated. The first one uses a greedy approach and the second one uses threshold-based selection again. Simulations compare the proposed schedulers and show their efficiency in terms of the number of vehicles served and the service delay. It is concluded that employing energy harvesting RSUs is a viable green alternative to grid-powered ones. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

Semiconductor manufacturing is probably one of the most prominent practical applications of such a problem. Existing disjunctive graph approaches for this combined problem rely on dedicated nodes to explicitly represent batches. To facilitate modifications of the graph, our new modeling reduces this complexity by encoding batching decisions into edge weights. An important contribution is an original algorithm that takes batching decisions “on the fly” during graph traversals. This algorithm is complemented by an integrated move to resequence and reassign operations. This combination yields a rich neighborhood that we apply within a local search and a Simulated Annealing (SA) metaheuristic. The latter is embedded in a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) which is the most efficient approach. Numerical results for benchmark instances of different problem types show the generality and applicability of our approach. The conciseness of our idea facilitates extensions towards further complex constraints needed in real-world applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Most works allocate the channel on the basis of the beam traffic load or the user terminal distribution of the current moment. These greedy-like algorithms neglect the intrinsic temporal correlation among the sequential channel allocation decisions, resulting in the spectrum resources underutilization. To solve this problem, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based DCA (DRL-DCA) algorithm is proposed. Specifically, the DCA optimization problem, which aims at minimizing the service blocking probability, is formulated in the multibeam satellite systems. Due to the temporal correlation property, the DCA optimization problem is modeled as the Markov decision process (MDP) which is the dominant analytical approach in DRL. In modeled MDP, the system state is reformulated into an image-like fashion, and then, convolutional neural network is used to extract useful features. Simulation results show that the DRL-DCA algorithm can decrease the blocking probability and improve the carried traffic and spectrum efficiency compared with other channel allocation algorithms. © 2013 IEEE.},

We solved this 3PL problem by developing an effective meta-heuristic based on the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP). This is achieved by introducing novel attributes in the construction of the restricted candidate list while incorporating flexible and intelligent rules, some of which are inspired by expert knowledge. The approach performs order consolidation, locates transshipment points and performs an optimal assignment of shipments to the selected consolidation points dynamically and in real time. This intelligent system embeds expert knowledge within the design of neighbourhood reduction schemes and data structures to speed up the search. This is achieved by recording computed data that does not need to be recomputed again while avoiding unnecessary computations of the non-promising alternatives. The performance of this real time optimisation and scheduling tool is tested with a European 3PL company over a 13 weeks period in late 2017 resulting in a significant cost saving and a considerable reduction in CO2 emissions. This powerful decision support system assists the 3PL company in gaining competitive leadership advantage through producing promising quotes that turn customer requests into real customer orders. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Expert Knowledge Recommendation System (EKRS) is a scientific research assistant system that actively provides experts with the latest domain knowledge according to their professional knowledge background. This paper applies the crowdsourcing task assignment method, taking experts as users and recommending corresponding professional knowledge as tasks. To solve the problems of inaccurate user-knowledge matching and low assignments in EKRS, a user-knowledge task assignment model is established. To maximize the number of global task assignments, the model first applies an improved greedy assignment algorithm to convert the user-knowledge task maximum assignment problem into the maximum weight problem in bipartite graphs. Based on the matching value between a task and a user, a task is assigned to the user with a high matching value. Then, the assigned tasks are sorted with the tree decomposition technique to obtain the optimal task scheduling scheme. The heuristic depth-first search algorithm (DFS+HA) is used to update the boundaries of the heuristic function quickly, and the assignment scheme of the optimal solution can be obtained efficiently through the upper and lower bounds of the search process. Finally, the algorithm was experimentally verified with artificial data sets and the real data extracted from EKRS. The experimental results indicated that the algorithm proposed in this paper can improve the amount of user-knowledge task assignment in EKRS, find the optimal assignment scheme to maximize the number of global task assignments, and improve the search efficiency. © 2020},

	abstract = {Along with the fourth industrial revolution, different tools coming from optimization, Internet of Things, data science, and artificial intelligence fields are creating new opportunities in production management. While manufacturing processes are stochastic and rescheduling decisions need to be made under uncertainty, it is still a complicated task to decide whether a rescheduling is worthwhile, which is often addressed in practice on a greedy basis. To find a tradeoff between rescheduling frequency and the growing accumulation of delays, we propose a rescheduling framework, which integrates machine learning (ML) techniques and optimization algorithms. To prove the effectiveness, we first model a flexible job-shop scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup and limited dual resources (FJSP) inspired by an industrial application. Then, we solve the scheduling problem through a hybrid metaheuristic approach. We train the ML classification model for identifying rescheduling patterns. Finally, we compare its rescheduling performance with periodical rescheduling approaches. Through observing the simulation results, we find the integration of these techniques can provide a good compromise between rescheduling frequency and scheduling delays. The main contributions of the work are the formalization of the FJSP problem, the development of ad hoc solution methods, and the proposal/validation of an innovative ML and optimization-based framework for supporting rescheduling decisions. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The car sequencing problem is a well established problem that models the conflicts arising from scheduling cars into an assembly line. However, the existing approaches to this problem do not consider non-regular or out-of-catalog vehicles, which are commonly manufactured in assembly lines. In this paper, we propose a new problem definition that deals with non-regular vehicles. This novel model is called robust Car Sequencing Problem. We model this realistic optimization problem using scenarios defined by different production plans. The problem can be solved by measuring the impact of the plans’ variability and by observing the violations of the problem constraints that appear when switching from one plan to another. In addition to our model formulation, we design and implement a set of constructive metaheuristics to tackle the traditional and the novel robust car sequencing problem. The selected metaheuristics are based on the greedy randomized adaptive search procedure, ant colony optimization, and variable neighborhood search. We have generated compatible instances from the main benchmark in the literature (CSPLib) and we have applied these metaheuristics for solving the new robust problem extension. We complement the experimental study by applying a post hoc statistical analysis for detecting statistically relevant differences between the metaheuristics performance. Our results show that a memetic ant colony optimization with local search is the best method since it performs well for every problem instance regardless of the difficulty of the problem (i.e., constraints and instance size). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

This production mode is more complicated and competitive in the real production process and includes two phases: production and assembly. Firstly, the production is conducted in several identical factories, and the production in each factory can be considered to a permutation flowshop scheduling problem (PFSP) with multi-machines. Then, the jobs produced in the first stage are assembled into final products. An enhanced population-based meta-heuristic – genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed for this problem. A greedy mating pool is designed to select promising parents in the selection operation, and an effective crossover strategy is designed based on the local search for speeding up convergence. To enhance the exploitation capability, several different local search strategies are incorporated into the algorithm, which are based on two neighbourhood structures.

	abstract = {In this paper, the Staff Transfer Problem (STP) in Human Resource Management is addressed as a stable matching problem. Earlier, formulation of this problem was of scheduling/allocation type. Here, the stable matching formulation is completely a new and more practical approach to the problem. This new formulation involves two preference lists: the first list contains the offices/locations preferred by the employees undergoing transfer and the second list contains the employees preferred by the employer of an office/location where those employees want to be transferred. The capacity of an office/location would act as a hard constraint. While matching these two lists, the objective is to maximize the number of transfers and at the same time to stabilize the matching, i.e., to minimize the number of blocking pairs. The resulting STP instance belongs to an instance of Maximum Size Minimum Blocking Pair Stable Matching with incomplete preference list (MAX SIZE MIN BP SMI) and has been proved in this paper to be NP-hard. As the problem is new in formulation, no previous work, method or result is available. There was no preference in selecting meta-heuristics. Among a large number of existing meta-heuristics, some most widely used meta-heuristics, namely, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms, Tabu Search and some variants of them have been chosen. Based on them four meta-heuristic approaches have been proposed, namely, btSA_match, gtSA_match, GA_match and TS_match. The variants btSA_match and gtSA_match are obtained from modifications made upon Simulated Annealing. EGA_match and TS_match are based on modified Genetic Algorithms and Tabu Search respectively. As there is no previous result in the existing literature, the performance has been compared among these four methods. It is observed that, variants of Simulated Annealing (SA) outperform others w.r.t. the performance metrics. The SA-variant with greedy nature, incorporated with a tabu list (gtSA_match) has shown that the best result on the basis of statistical analysis. © 2019, Operational Research Society of India.},

The consideration of the assignment of workers and the reduction of ergonomic risks in U-shaped assembly lines is of paramount importance. However, the objectives of efficient task and worker assignment and a reduction in ergonomic risks are not usually correlated. Moreover, there is limited research in the existing literature into multi-objective approaches in U-shaped assembly lines. We formulate a U-shaped assembly worker assignment and balancing problem to simultaneously minimize cycle times and ergonomic risks. In addition, and due to its simplicity and successful results in flow shop scheduling problems, a Restarted Iterated Pareto Greedy algorithm is designed to optimize both objectives. In this algorithm, a problem-specific heuristic-based initialization is extended to improve the initial solution. Two precedence-based greedy and local search phases are developed to exploit the space around the current solution. Finally, a restart mechanism is proposed to help the algorithm escape from local optima. Comprehensive computational results, supported by detailed statistical analyses, suggest that the proposed multi-objective algorithm outperforms existing methods on a large number of benchmark instances. © 2020},

Joint design of the uplink/downlink transmission direction of users and the power allocation is crucial for achieving high system performance in the FD multi-user network. In this paper, we investigate the joint uplink/downlink transmission direction assignment (TDA), user paring (UP), and power allocation problem for maximizing the system max-min fairness (MMF) rate in an FD multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system. The problem is formulated with a two-Time-scale structure, where the TDA and the UP variables are for optimizing a long-Term MMF rate while the power allocation is for optimizing an instantaneous MMF rate during each channel coherence interval. We show that the studied joint MMF rate maximization problem is NP-hard in general. To obtain high-quality suboptimal solutions, we propose efficient methods based on simple relaxation and greedy rounding techniques. The simulation results are presented to show that the proposed algorithms are effective and achieve higher MMF rates than the existing heuristic methods. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

MASC combines the strengths of genetic algorithm (GA), simulated annealing (SA), and Nawaz–Enscore–Ham (NEH) algorithm. The aim is to enhance GA in identifying promising areas in the search space, whose local optima will be subsequently located by SA. This is achieved by means of novel crossover and mutation operators that construct chromosomes by using two different types of genes: static and dynamic genes. MASC is tested on the well-known Taillard's benchmark instances. The proposed operators are compared with traditional operators. The results show that the proposed operators produce considerable improvements. These improvements reach up to 20.79% in the average relative error of best solution and 11.86% in the average relative error of average solution. MASC is compared with fourteen well-known and state-of-the-art algorithms. These algorithms include MA, whale optimization, ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, artificial bee colony, monkey search, and iterated greedy. The results show that MASC outperforms all the compared algorithms except three iterated greedy algorithms. Moreover, the improvement in the average relative error of best solution achieved on the best-so-far MA is 37.92%.

	abstract = {Due to the constantly increasing mission demands for the space network (SN), the technical issue of high-efficient scheduling has attracted continuous attention in recent years. Most of the previous scheduling algorithms have generally ignored two critical factors, i.e., the dynamic property of single access (SA) antenna's setup times and the time-space distribution characteristics of users' requested missions. In this paper, we build a mathematical model for the heterogeneous intersatellite link antenna (ILA) pointing route problem with the consideration of constraints on visibility windows and dynamic setup times. Specifically, the ILA's pointing mechanics cost and the missions' time-space distribution are first taken into account into the scheduling model. Meanwhile, a new two-stage heuristic algorithm with hierarchical scheduling strategies is proposed to solve this optimization model. Finally, we employ the SN dataset to verify our proposed model by comparing three algorithms, the existing greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) algorithm with static setup times, our improved GRASP algorithm with dynamic setup times, and our proposed two-stage heuristic algorithm. Experimental results show that our improved GRASP can schedule 3.72%, 10.36%, 12.51% more missions and can consume 53.18%, 49.95%, and 49.32% less setup times of SA antennas than the original Rojanasoonthon's GRASP for the mission scale of 200, 400, and 600, respectively. Moreover, compared with the improved GRASP algorithm, our proposed two-stage heuristic algorithm is more effective, which can further enhance the total number of scheduled missions by 2.41%, 4.43%, and 6.02% and reduce the setup times of SA antennas by 11.84%, 10.38%, and 9.54%. © 1965-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Task scheduling is critical for improving system performance in the distributed heterogeneous computing environment. The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) tasks scheduling problem is NP-complete and it is hard to find an optimal schedule. Due to its key importance, the DAG tasks scheduling problem has been extensively studied in the literature. However, many previously proposed traditional heuristic algorithms are usually based on greedy methods and also lack the consideration of scheduling tasks between trusted and untrusted entities, which makes the problem more complicated, but there still exists a large optimization space to be explored. In this paper, we propose a trust-aware adaptive DAG tasks scheduling algorithm using the reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) methods. The scheduling problem is defined using the reinforcement learning model. Efficient scheduling state space, action space and reward function are designed to train the policy gradient-based REINFORCE agent. The MCTS method is proposed to determine actual scheduling policies when DAG tasks are simultaneously executed in trusted and untrusted entities. Leveraging the algorithm's capability of exploring long term reward, the proposed algorithm could achieve good scheduling policies while guaranteeing trusted tasks scheduled within trusted entities. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with the classic HEFT/CPOP algorithms. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {To address sustainable development issues of urban traffic, electric buses will join traditional bus system, and the scheduling of bus fleet should be adjusted due to the distinct features of electric buses. To this end, this paper develops a Multi-objective Bi-level programming model to collaboratively optimize the vehicle scheduling and charging scheduling of the mixed bus fleet under the operating conditions of a single depot. The upper level determines the vehicle scheduling to minimize the operating cost and carbon emissions under the constraints of connecting time between trips and the limited driving range of electric buses. The lower level is a charging scheduling problem that considers the charging time and the limited driving distance constraint to minimize the charging cost. The proposed model is solved with an integrated heuristic algorithm. The vehicle scheduling problem is addressed with the iterative neighborhood search algorithm based on simulated annealing, while the charging scheduling problem is solved with a greedy dynamic selection strategy based on the approach of multi-stage decision. Finally, case study is carried out based on a mixed bus fleet in Beijing, and the results validate the availability of the proposed model and solution algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The automated track inspection is one of the most common inspection methods used to monitor the health of the rail tracks. Automated inspection is commonly carried out by vehicles equipped with technology capable of ultrasonic track inspection. Scheduling an automated inspection vehicle is, therefore, crucial to optimise the safety benefits achieved from inspection. In this study, we introduce a bi-objective track inspection scheduling problem for an automated ultrasonic inspection vehicle. This model maximises the safety benefits and minimises the time required for completing the scheduled inspections. We propose an evolutionary scheduling heuristic and compare it to a naive greedy scheduling method. Through a numerical study, we conclude that the evolutionary scheduling heuristic outperforms the greedy scheduling heuristic. Furthermore, we note that considering two objectives for track inspection planning leads to inspection schedules with higher safety benefits per unit inspection time. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an integrated approach to solve two shift scheduling problems for local public bus companies: the first one aims at finding a schedule for vehicles, given a set of rides to do; the second one aims at assigning drivers to vehicle schedules. The first subproblem to be faced is the Multiple Depot Vehicle Scheduling Problem that is known to be NP-hard. Therefore, heuristic algorithms are needed to find feasible solutions for real-life instances. In this work a starting solution for this problem is found by using a greedy algorithm. This solution is then improved by a simulated annealing strategy that exploits several local search techniques. The second problem to deal with is the Crew Scheduling Problem where each trip is assigned to a driver. This problem is still NP-Hard. In this paper an initial solution for the Crew Scheduling Problem is firstly found with a classical sequential approach. This solution is then modified by changing the allocation of trips on vehicles in order to minimize the combined objective function. Both the problems have been modeled taking into account as more real-world constraints as possible. Several constraints take into account the European Union restrictions related to how the driver shifts must be composed. The proposed problem is different from the ones presented in the literature, as the mathematical model, and the related algorithm, are designed based on real world-requirements. Computational results have been carried out on large real-word instances. The results show that the proposed algorithm is able to find quickly good solutions within a limited computational time. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Energy harvesting (EH) emerges as a novel technology to promote green energy policies. Based on Cognitive Radio (CR) paradigm, nodes are designed to operate with harvested energy from radio frequency signals. CR-EH systems state several strategies based on sensing and access policies to maximize throughput and protect primary users from interference, simultaneously. However, reported solutions do not consider to maximize detection performance to detect spectrum holes which represent a major drawback whenever available energy is not efficiently used. In this concern, this paper addresses optimal sensing policies based on energy harvesting schemes to maximize probability of detection of available spectrum. These novel policies may be incorporated to previous reported solutions to maximize performance. Optimal processing scheduling schemes are proposed for offline and online scenarios based on convex optimization theory, Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm and heuristic solutions (Constant Power and Greedy policies). Performance of proposed policies are validated by simulations for common detection techniques such as Matched Filter (MF), Quadrature Matched Filter (QMF) and Energy Detector (ED). As a result, it is shown that the best detection scheme theoretically addressed by MF, does not always perform better than the poorest detection scheme, given by the ED, in an energy harvesting scenario. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

As the installation cost and the completion period of the installation are important aspects in the construction of an offshore wind farm, the proposed method is used to deal with those conflicting objectives. We develop a mathematical model using integer linear programming (ILP) to determine the optimal installation schedule considering several constraints such as weather condition and the availability of vessels. We suggest two approaches to deal with the multi-objective installation scheduling problem, namely compromise programming with exact method and with metaheuristic techniques. In the exact method the problem is solved by CPLEX whereas in the metaheuristic approach we propose Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS) and Simulated Annealing (SA). Moreover, greedy algorithms and a local search for solving the scheduling problem are introduced. Two generated datasets are used for testing our approaches. The computational experiments show that the proposed metaheuristic approaches produce interesting results as the optimal solution for some cases is obtained. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd},

First, the ant colony system is applied to scheduling from a new standpoint by guiding ants to explore task priorities and simultaneously assign tasks to machines. Second, forward/backward dependence is defined to indicate the global significance of each node, based on which, a new heuristic factor is proposed to help ants search for task sequences.

Broadcasters actively manage their advertising revenue by jointly optimizing sales and scheduling policies. We characterize the optimal dynamic schedule in a simplified setting that incorporates stochastic break durations and advertisement lengths of 15 and 30 seconds. The optimal policy is a "greedy" look-ahead rule that accounts for the remaining number of breaks; in this setting, there is no value to perfect information at the scheduling stage, and hence knowing the duration of all breaks would not change the schedule. We present heuristics to help solve scheduling problems of even greater complexity. The performance of these heuristics under various scenarios is tested by running simulations calibrated using industry data. The simple greedy heuristic is shown to perform well except when revenues are concave in ad length, in which case the look-ahead aspect of the optimal schedule becomes more important. Finally, we recommend ways for broadcasters to balance their portfolio of booked ads by determining the optimal overbooking level and mix of ads as a function of their associated revenues generated and penalties incurred. ©2016 INFORMS.},

	abstract = {Abstract The rapidly developed wireless services and applications have an increasing demand of spectrum resource, which is actually limited. Therefore, how to allocate spectrum resource effectively for network throughput improvement is an urgent issue. Although the utilization of spectrum can be enhanced by link scheduling for spatial reuse, Network Coding (NC) for broadcast transmission, multicast transmission and multi-channel multi-radio techniques, their interactions cannot be ignored. This is because on one hand, the achieved network performance by NC is strongly dependent on the MAC layer, and greedy NC method may in fact reduce network throughput owing to the reduction of spectrum spatial reuse. On the other hand, channel assignment faces more challenges brought by NC and multicast transmission since the broadcast or multicast links are dominated by the link with the worst channel state. In order to utilize the spectrum resource adaptively while not bringing additional constraints, we present a two-phase solution approach. On the first step, we formulate the NC-aware scheduling scheme to an optimization problem, by which the interference-free links are allocated into the same link set and can be activated in the same time slot and channel. Then, we assign different channels to the link sets according to the radio constraints in a heuristic method, which can further increase the utilization of spectrum resource. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method can largely increase the utilization of spectrum resource and improve network throughput. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This article presents a novel matheuristic for solving the hump yard block-to-track assignment problem. This is an important problem arising in the railway freight industry and involves scheduling the transitions of a set of rail cars from a set of inbound trains to a set of outbound trains over a certain planning horizon. It was also the topic of the 2014 challenge organized by the Railway Applications Section of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences for which the proposed matheuristic was awarded first prize. Our approach decomposes the problem into three highly dependent subproblems. Optimization-based strategies are adopted for two of these, while the third is solved using a greedy heuristic. We demonstrate the efficiency of the complete framework on the official datasets, where solutions within 4-14% of a known lower bound (to a relaxed problem) are found. We further show that improvements of around 8% can be achieved if outbound trains are allowed to be delayed by up to 2 h in the hope of ensuring an earlier connection for some of the rail cars. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {The power economic dispatch is one of the most important problems in power system operation. Its objective is to minimize the total generation cost of the generating units while satisfying various constraints of the units and system. In past decades, modern metaheuristics have been applied in solving the economic dispatch problem due to their ability to find an almost global optimal solution. Recently, inspired in classical GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure) algorithm, Hirsch et al. (2006) proposed a novel variant of the GRASP for continuous domain, called continuous GRASP (C-GRASP) algorithm. This paper proposes a combination of C-GRASP and differential evolution (DE) algorithm (C-GRASP-DE) in order to improve the global searching capability and prevent the convergence to local minima. The feasibility and performance of proposed C-GRASP and DE is demonstrated by power systems consisting of 13, 40 and 140 generators whose fuel cost function is calculated taking into account the effect of valve-point loading. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed C-GRASP in combination with a self-adaptive DE approach (C-GRASP-SaDE) compared to the classical C-GRASP. Furthermore, some obtained optimization results for the three case studies by the proposed C-GRASP-SaDE are competitive with the best results presented in recent literature. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The improvement is achieved through adding a crossover operation followed by a greedy selection process while replacing the mean best position of the particles with the personal best position of each particle in the velocity updating equation. The improved algorithm is also augmented with a self-adaption mechanism that eliminates the need for tuning the algorithm parameters based on characteristics of the considered optimization problem. Practical features such as valve point effects, prohibited operating zones, multiple fuel options, and ramp rate limits are considered in the mathematical formulation of the economic dispatch problem.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an effective solution for a complex planning problem encountered in heavy industry. The problem entails selecting a set of projects to produce from a larger set of solicited projects and simultaneously scheduling their production to maximize profit. Each project has a due window inside of which, if accepted, it must be shipped. Additionally, there is a limited inventory buffer where lots produced early are stored. Because scheduling affects which projects may be selected and vice-versa, this is a particularly difficult combinatorial optimization problem.; Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop an algorithm based on the Metaheuristic for Randomized Priority Search (Meta-RaPS) as well as a greedy heuristic and an integer programming (IP) model. The authors then perform computational experiments on a large set of benchmark problems over a wide range of characteristics to compare the performance of each method in terms of solution quality and time required.; Findings: The paper shows that this problem is very difficult to solve using IP, with even small instances unable to be solved optimally. The paper then shows that both proposed algorithms will in seconds often outperform IP by a large margin. Meta-RaPS is particularly robust, consistently producing the best or very near-best solutions.; Practical implications: The Meta-RaPS algorithm developed enables companies facing this problem to achieve higher profits through improved decision making. Moreover, this algorithm is relatively easy to implement.; Originality/value: This research provides an effective solution for a difficult combinatorial optimization problem encountered in heavy industry which has not been previously addressed in the literature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) is regarded as one of the problems which is widely studied. This paper presents a bee colony optimization (BCO) algorithm with a local search named the modified two-enhancement scheme with neighbourhood N5 perturbation (BCO+mTESN5) to solve the JSSP. In previous research, the BCO algorithm with TESN5 local search (BCO+TESN5) is applied to solve the JSSP. The BCO+TESN5 algorithm uses a brute force strategy in performing the N5 neighbourhood local search. However, the brute force local search strategy incurs expensive overhead. To address the high overhead issue, the BCO+mTESN5 algorithm is proposed where the local search is performed on a targeted bottleneck machine within the N5 neighbourhood structure. The selection of the targeted bottleneck machine is done based on a list of bottleneck machines identified by the shifting bottleneck heuristic (SBH). Two selection strategies are tested to select the targeted bottleneck machine, namely: the greedy selection and the linear ranking selection. The proposed algorithms are examined using a set of benchmark problems obtained from the OR-library. The results show that the proposed BCO+mTESN5 with linear ranking selection successfully solves 54% of the 82 OR-library benchmark dataset to ≤ 1% from known optimum and it is comparable to the BCO+TESN5 algorithm. In terms of computational time to obtain the best makespan, the proposed BCO+mTESN5 with linear ranking selection outperforms the BCO+TESN5 algorithm by 25%.},

	abstract = {Discrete particle swarm optimization is one of the most recently developed population-based meta-heuristic optimization algorithm in swarm intelligence that can be used in any discrete optimization problems. This article presents a discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm to efficiently schedule the tasks in the heterogeneous multiprocessor systems. All the optimization algorithms share a common algorithmic step, namely population initialization. It plays a significant role because it can affect the convergence speed and also the quality of the final solution. The random initialization is the most commonly used method in majority of the evolutionary algorithms to generate solutions in the initial population. The initial good quality solutions can facilitate the algorithm to locate the optimal solution or else it may prevent the algorithm from finding the optimal solution. Intelligence should be incorporated to generate the initial population in order to avoid the premature convergence. This article presents a discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm, which incorporates opposition-based technique to generate initial population and greedy algorithm to balance the load of the processors. Make span, flow time, and reliability cost are three different measures used to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm for scheduling independent tasks in distributed systems. Computational simulations are done based on a set of benchmark instances to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. © The Author(s) 2016.},

Being one of the most relevant and challenging problems faced by decision makers from shipping companies, this tramp shipping problem lies in determining the set of contracts that should be served by each ship and the time windows that ships should use to serve each contract, with the aim of minimizing total costs. The use of discretized time windows allows for the consideration of a broad variety of features and practical constraints in a simple way.

	abstract = {In the no-idle flowshop, machines cannot be idle after finishing one job and before starting the next one. Therefore, start times of jobs must be delayed to guarantee this constraint. In practice machines show this behavior as it might be technically unfeasible or uneconomical to stop a machine in between jobs. This has important ramifications in the modern industry including fiber glass processing, foundries, production of integrated circuits and the steel making industry, among others. However, to assume that all machines in the shop have this no-idle constraint is not realistic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to study the mixed no-idle extension where only some machines have the no-idle constraint. We present a mixed integer programming model for this new problem and the equations to calculate the makespan. We also propose a set of formulas to accelerate the calculation of insertions that is used both in heuristics as well as in the local search procedures. An effective iterated greedy (IG) algorithm is proposed. We use an NEH-based heuristic to construct a high quality initial solution. A local search using the proposed accelerations is employed to emphasize intensification and exploration in the IG. A new destruction and construction procedure is also shown. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we present several adaptations of other well-known and recent metaheuristics for the problem and conduct a comprehensive set of computational and statistical experiments with a total of 1750 instances. The results show that the proposed IG algorithm outperforms existing methods in the no-idle and in the mixed no-idle scenarios by a significant margin. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

As the inbound baggage handling problem turns out to be NP-hard, we propose a hybrid heuristic combining a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure with a guided fast local search and pathrelinking. We demonstrate how we implemented the algorithm at Munich's Franz Josef Strauss Airport where it is in use to operate the inbound baggage handling process. In a case study, we compare the results of the mathematical model with the solutions of the hybrid heuristic and the solutions provided by the airport. The proposed algorithm reduces baggage peaks at the baggage carousels by 38% and waiting times for passengers by 11%.

Among the plethora of randomized heuristics, this paper reviews those that contain biased-randomized procedures (BRPs). A BRP is a procedure to select the next constructive ‘movement’ from a list of candidates in which their elements have different probabilities based on some criteria (e.g., ranking, priority rule, heuristic value, etc.). The main idea behind biased randomization is the introduction of a slight modification in the greedy constructive behavior that provides a certain degree of randomness while maintaining the logic behind the heuristic. BRPs can be categorized into two main groups according to how choice probabilities are computed: (i) BRPs using an empirical bias function; and (ii) BRPs using a skewed theoretical probability distribution. This paper analyzes the second group and illustrates, throughout a series of numerical experiments, how these BRPs can benefit from parallel computing in order to significantly outperform heuristics and even simple metaheuristic approaches, thus providing reasonably good solutions in ‘real time’ to different problems in the areas of transportation, logistics, and scheduling. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the optimization of cleaning schedules of heat exchangers in crude preheat trains in petroleum refineries. The optimization approach is based on a heuristic scheme composed of a set of movements according to a greedy rationale. Each evaluation of the objective function demands the simulation of the behavior of the crude preheat train during the investigated time horizon. The optimization scheme can be employed using two alternatives: a basic and a recursive heuristic algorithm, where the recursive option can obtain better solutions, but demanding higher computational efforts. The proposed optimization approach does not present nonconvergence problems and does not demand any special attention related to control parameters tuning. The proposed approach was applied to three examples of cleaning schedule optimization problems from the literature. The solutions obtained present values of objective function better or very near to the best solution previously reported. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We propose in this paper to study the energy-, thermal- and performance-aware resource management in heterogeneous datacenters. Witnessing the continuous development of heterogeneity in datacenters, we are confronted with their different behaviors in terms of performance, power consumption and thermal dissipation: indeed, heterogeneity at server level lies both in the computing infrastructure (computing power, electrical power consumption) and in the heat removal systems (different enclosure, fans, thermal sinks). Also the physical locations of the servers become important with heterogeneity since some servers can (over)heat others. While many studies address independently these parameters (most of the time performance and power or energy), we show in this paper the necessity to tackle all these aspects for an optimal resource management of the computing resources. This leads to improved energy usage in a heterogeneous datacenter including the cooling of the computer rooms. We build our approach on the concept of heat distribution matrix to handle the mutual influence of the servers, in heterogeneous environments, which is novel in this context. We propose a heuristic to solve the server placement problem and we design a generic greedy framework for the online scheduling problem. We derive several single-objective heuristics (for performance, energy, cooling) and a novel fuzzy-based priority mechanism to handle their tradeoffs. Finally, we show results using extensive simulations fed with actual measurements on heterogeneous servers. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This article presents an Evolution Strategy (ES)-based algorithm, designed to self-adapt its mutation operators, guiding the search into the solution space using a Self-Adaptive Reduced Variable Neighborhood Search procedure. In view of the specific local search operators for each individual, the proposed population-based approach also fits into the context of the Memetic Algorithms. The proposed variant uses the Greedy Rand omized Adaptive Search Procedure with different greedy parameters for generating its initial population, providing an interesting exploration-exploitation balance. To validate the proposal, this framework is applied to solve three different NP-Hard combinatorial optimization problems: an Open-Pit-Mining Operational Planning Problem with dynamic allocation of trucks, an Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem with Setup Times, and the calibration of a hybrid fuzzy model for Short-Term Load Forecasting. Computational results point out the convergence of the proposed model and highlight its ability in combining the application of move operations from distinct neighborhood structures along the optimization. The results gathered and reported in this article represent a collective evidence of the performance of the method in challenging combinatorial optimization problems from different application domains. The proposed evolution strategy demonstrates an ability of adapting the strength of the mutation disturbance during the generations of its evolution process. The effectiveness of the proposal motivates the application of this novel evolutionary framework for solving other combinatorial optimization problems. © 2016 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

The performances of several heuristic link scheduling policies are analyzed in terms of computation effort and achievable throughput of the solution. The performance characteristics are then validated through simulation, showing that the greedy knapsack solution achieves within 99%of the optimal allocation in less than 2% of the computation time compared to traditional solvers.

	abstract = {We study the optimal scheduling problem for minimizing the length of the schedule required to satisfy the traffic demands of the links in single-hop multiple access wireless networks using Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC). We first formulate the optimal scheduling as a Linear Programming (LP) problem where each variable represents the time allocated to a subset of the links sorted according to their decoding order for SIC at the receiver. Since the LP formulation requires a high number of variables exponential in the decoding capability of the receiver, we propose a Column Generation Method (CGM) based heuristic algorithm. This algorithm is based on decomposing the original problem into Restricted Master Problem (RMP) and Pricing Problem (PP), and approximating the exponentially complex PP by a greedy heuristic algorithm. Compared to the CGM based heuristic algorithms previously proposed for minimum length scheduling problem in various types of networks, the formulation of the PP and the heuristic algorithm proposed for PP are different due to the requirement of including the decoding order of simultaneous transmissions in SIC based networks. We demonstrate via simulations that the proposed algorithm performs very close to the optimal LP formulation with runtime robust to the increasing number of the links and decoding capability of the receiver, and much smaller than that of the optimal algorithm. © 2012 IEEE.},

We present some advanced and effective technologies, including three mixed neighborhood structures, an enhanced perturbation method, and an enhanced destruction and construction procedure for the trajectory-based metaheuristics. We propose a path-relinking-based cooperative search, a diversity control scheme, and a diversified initialization approach for the improved fruit fly optimization. We calibrate the parameters and operators for the proposed algorithms by means of a design of experiments approach. To evaluate the proposed algorithms, we present several adaptations of other recent well-known meta-heuristics for the problem and conduct a comprehensive set of computational and statistical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented algorithms.

	abstract = {Reducing energy consumption is an increasingly important issue in cloud computing, more specifically when dealing with High Performance Computing (HPC). Minimizing energy consumption can significantly reduce the amount of energy bills and then increase the provider's profit. In addition, the reduction of energy decreases greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, many researches are carried out to develop new methods in order to make HPC applications consuming less energy. In this paper, we present a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MO-GA) that optimizes the energy consumption, CO2 emissions and the generated profit of a geographically distributed cloud computing infrastructure. We also propose a greedy heuristic that aims to maximize the number of scheduled applications in order to compare it with the MO-GA. The two approaches have been experimented using realistic workload traces from Feitelson's PWA Parallel Workload Archive. The results show that MO-GA outperforms the greedy heuristic by a significant margin in terms of energy consumption and CO2 emissions. In addition, MO-GA is also proved to be slightly better in terms of profit while scheduling more applications. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a variable iterated greedy algorithm for solving the traveling salesman problem with time windows (TSPTW) to identify a tour minimizing the total travel cost or the makespan, separately. The TSPTW has several practical applications in both production scheduling and logistic operations. The proposed algorithm basically relies on a greedy algorithm generating an increasing number of neighboring solutions through the use of the idea of neighborhood change in variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithms. In other words, neighboring solutions are generated by destructing a solution component and re-constructing the solution again with variable destruction sizes. In addition, the proposed algorithm is hybridized with a VNS algorithm employing backward and forward 1-Opt local searches to further enhance the solution quality. The performance of the proposed algorithm was tested on several benchmark suites from the literature. Experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm is either competitive to or even better than the best performing algorithms from the literature. Ultimately, new best-known solutions are obtained for 38 out of 125 problem instances of the recently proposed benchmark suite, whereas 15 out of 31 problem instances are also further improved for the makespan criterion. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Manpower optimization and job scheduling represent key elements in the Work Force Management (WFM) field. Large-scale corporations face a trade-off, where the staff is bounded to achieve savings but customers should receive the service effectively and timely. A combinatorial optimization problem for contract and job scheduling is introduced, inspired in large-scale corporations. The main simplifications in this Contract-Scheduling problem are multiclass Poissonian customer arrivals, exponential services, one-to-one attention and fixed salaries from the staff. The goal is to minimize the staff respecting multiple timing constraints (coming from customers), and define atomic units inside the corporation that offer independent services. Even under these simplifications, the problem belongs to the class of NP-Hard decision problems. Specifically, the feasibility of Contract-Scheduling problem includes the determination of the chromatic number of a graph. As a consequence, a heuristic methodology is developed for its resolution, combining Monte Carlo simulation and a greedy-randomized technique. Numerical results confirm an intuitive contract approach is true: units should be stressed offering the maximum number of affine services, and the staff should be kept as small as possible, respecting demand constraints.},

In this paper, we investigate a cross-layer design problem in MIMO-based WMNs, which involves end-to-end rate allocation, routing, and stream control scheduling. Scheduling is addressed by using a set of transmission configurations (TCs), and a greedy heuristic algorithm is proposed to identify a good subset of all possible TCs. We define three optimization problems to find the maximum throughput, max-min fair and proportional fair rate allocation solutions. We propose a cross-layer scheme to solve these problems.We also discuss how the proposed cross-layer scheme can be implemented on the basis of the IEEE 802.16 mesh mode.

	abstract = {This paper develops and compares several optimization approaches for the version planning and release problem. This problem is new, challenging for scholars and practitioners, and was not fully addressed in the OR literature. Version releases are part of a wide-spread phenomenon. Mobile phones, operating systems (e.g. MS-Windows) and digital printers are well known examples. However, version release can be found in many other product development fields, such as software products and games, and hardware versions (e.g. TV, screens, communication equipment etc.). In some fields (such as the automotive field) the version release is so well-established that it became an annual routine. An optimization formulation is developed for the total-value of a version-release policy throughout the relevant time-horizon. The novel formulation elements are release-features and release-dates. The value of each release is derived from the combination of features included in the specific released version, and the version release-dates. We developed several search techniques for solving this strongly NP-hard problem. We compared the results of (1) multiple particle swarm optimization (MPSO) (2) Genetic Algorithm (GA), (3) simulated annealing (SA), (4 & 5) two forms of greedy heuristics. A comprehensive computational experiment was performed. The study shows that GA and MPSO outperform the other methods. Moreover, for medium scale problems, GA better suits highly resource-constrained cases, while MPSO performs best for large scale problems disregarding the resource scarcity. This research may be a major reference point for future research on the version release problem. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Cloud Computing is a promising paradigm for parallel computing. However, as Cloud-based services become more dynamic, resource provisioning in Clouds becomes more challenging. The paradigm, with its promise of virtually infinite resources, seems to suit well in solving resource greedy scientific computing problems. In a Cloud, an appropriate number of Virtual Machines (VM) is created and allocated in physical resources for executing jobs. This work focuses on the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model where custom VMs are launched in appropriate hosts available in a Cloud to execute scientific experiments coming from multiple users. Finding optimal solutions to allocate VMs to physical resources is an NP-complete problem, and therefore many heuristics have been developed. In this work, we describe and evaluate two Cloud schedulers based on Swarm Intelligence (SI) techniques, particularly Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The main performance metrics to study are the number of serviced users by the Cloud and the total number of created VMs in online (non-batch) scheduling scenarios. We also perform a sensitivity analysis by varying the specific-parameter values of each algorithm to evaluate the impact on the performance of the two objective metrics. The intra-Cloud network traffic is also measured. Simulated experiments performed using CloudSim and job data from real scientific problems show that the use of SI-based techniques succeeds in balancing the studied metrics compared to Genetic Algorithms. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

	abstract = {Ship block transportation problems are crucial issues to address in reducing the construction cost and improving the productivity of shipyards. Shipyards aim to maximize the workload balance of transporters with time constraint such that all blocks should be transported during the planning horizon. This process leads to three types of penalty time: empty transporter travel time, delay time, and tardy time. This study aims to minimize the sum of the penalty time. First, this study presents the problem of ship block transportation with the generalization of the block transportation restriction on the multi-type transporter. Second, the problem is transformed into the classical traveling salesman problem and assignment problem through a reasonable model simplification and by adding a virtual node to the proposed directed graph. Then, a heuristic algorithm based on greedy algorithm is proposed to assign blocks to available transporters and sequencing blocks for each transporter simultaneously. Finally, the numerical experiment method is used to validate the model, and its result shows that the proposed algorithm is effective in realizing the efficient use of the transporters in shipyards. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the promising application of the proposed method to efficiently improve the utilization of transporters and to reduce the cost of ship block logistics for shipyards. © 2016 Eastern Macedonia and Thrace Institute of Technology.},

	abstract = {Today's giant data centers are power hungry. Data center energy saving not only helps control the operational cost, but also benefits the sustainable growth of cloud services. Due to the adoption of much more switches in modern data centers as well as the mature server-side power management techniques, energy saving for the data center network is becoming increasingly important. Most previous works on saving data center network energy focus on aggregating flows to as few switches as possible. However, in this paper we argue that this method may not work for network-limited flows, the throughputs of which are elastic based on the competing flows. To save the network energy consumed by this kind of elastic flows, we propose a flow scheduling approach called Willow, which takes both the number of switches involved and their active working durations into consideration. We formulate this problem by programming and design a greedy approximate algorithm to schedule flows in an online manner. Simulations based on MapReduce traces show that Willow can save up to 60 percent network energy compared with ECMP scheduling in typical settings, and outperforms other classical heuristic algorithms such as simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization. Testbed Experiments demonstrate that this kind of dynamic energy-efficient flow scheduling causes negligible impact on upper-layer applications. © 2014 IEEE.},

The idea of seeking further improvement in the iterated greedy (IG) algorithm framework is based on the observation that the construction phase of the original IG algorithm may not achieve good performance in escaping from local minima when incorporating the insertion neighborhood search. To overcome this limitation, we have modified the IG algorithm by utilizing a Tabu-based reconstruction strategy to enhance its exploration ability. A powerful neighborhood search method that involves insert, swap, and double-insert moves is then applied to obtain better solutions from the reconstructed solution in the previous step. Empirical results on several benchmark problem instances and those generated randomly confirm the advantages of utilizing the new reconstruction scheme. In addition, our results also show that the proposed TMIIG algorithm is relatively more effective in minimizing the makespan than other existing well-performing heuristic algorithms. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Three-way joint optimization of performance (P), energy (E), and temperature (T) in scheduling parallel tasks to multiple cores poses a challenge that is staggering in its computational complexity. The goal of the PET optimized scheduling (PETOS) problem is to minimize three quantities: the completion time of a task graph, the total energy consumption, and the peak temperature of the system. Algorithms based on conventional multi-objective optimization techniques can be designed for solving the PETOS problem. But their execution times are exceedingly high and hence their applicability is restricted merely to problems of modest size. Exacerbating the problem is the solution space that is typically a Pareto front since no single solution can be strictly best along all three objectives. Thus, not only is the absolute quality of the solutions important but "the spread of the solutions" along each objective and the distribution of solutions within the generated tradeoff front are also desired. A natural alternative is to design efficient heuristic algorithms that can generate good solutions as well as good spreads - note that most of the prior work in energy-efficient task allocation is predominantly single- or dual-objective oriented. Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing a parallel program, a heuristic encompasses policies as to what tasks should go to what cores and at what frequency should that core operate. Various policies, such as greedy, iterative, and probabilistic, can be employed. However, the choice and usage of these policies can influence a heuristic towards a particular objective and can also profoundly impact its performance. This article proposes 16 heuristics that utilize various methods for task-to-core allocation and frequency selection. This article also presents a methodical classification scheme which not only categorizes the proposed heuristics but can also accommodate additional heuristics. Extensive simulation experiments compare these algorithms while shedding light on their strengths and tradeoffs. © 2016 ACM.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the single machine scheduling problem with weighted quadratic tardiness costs. Three metaheuristics are presented, namely iterated local search, variable greedy and steady-state genetic algorithm procedures. These address a gap in the existing literature, which includes branch-and-bound algorithms (which can provide optimal solutions for small problems only) and dispatching rules (which are efficient and capable of providing adequate solutions for even quite large instances). A simple local search procedure which incorporates problem specific information is also proposed. The computational results show that the proposed metaheuristics clearly outperform the best of the existing procedures. Also, they provide an optimal solution for all (or nearly all, in the case of the variable greedy heuristic) the smaller size problems. The metaheuristics are quite close in what regards solution quality. Nevertheless, the iterated local search method provides the best solution, though at the expense of additional computational time. The exact opposite is true for the variable greedy procedure, while the genetic algorithm is a good all-around performer. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Network function virtualization (NFV) has already been a new paradigm for network architectures. By migrating NFs from dedicated hardware to virtualization platform, NFV can effectively improve the flexibility to deploy and manage service function chains (SFCs). However, resource allocation for requested SFC in NFV-based infrastructures is not trivial as it mainly consists of three phases: virtual network functions (VNFs) chain composition, VNFs forwarding graph embedding, and VNFs scheduling. The decision of these three phases can be mutually dependent, which also makes it a tough task. Therefore, a coordinated approach is studied in this paper to jointly optimize NFV resource allocation in these three phases. We apply a general cost model to consider both network costs and service performance. The coordinate NFV-RA is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming, and a heuristic-based algorithm (JoraNFV) is proposed to get the near optimal solution. To make the coordinated NFV-RA more tractable, JoraNFV is divided into two sub-algorithms, one-hop optimal traffic scheduling and a multi-path greedy algorithm for VNF chain composition and VNF forwarding graph embedding. Last, extensive simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of JoraNFV, and results have shown that JoraNFV can get a solution within 1.25 times of the optimal solution with reasonable execution time, which indicates that JoraNFV can be used for online NFV planning. © 2013 IEEE.},

Planning the work of these security guards is challenging because it requires dealing not only with the complexity inherent to crew scheduling problems but also with an optimisation goal that itself is defined more in qualitative than quantitative terms. Our contribution to handling these challenges is summarised as follows:we describe the problem and model it as a shortest path problem and a set covering problem with additional constraints;we adapt an existing heuristic that is based on Lagrangian relaxation, subgradient optimisation, column generation and greedy heuristics to be applicable to the problem (for instance, we add an improvement step based on local search);we implement the resulting solution method, resulting in a software prototype named TUTIS;we test TUTIS with a real problem instance supplied by Netherlands Railways. Experimental results lead security experts to believe that the prototype not only presents meaningful results in terms of scheduling work, but also can help decide the way security guards will be deployed in the future. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Cyclic hoist scheduling problems in automated electroplating lines and surface processing shops attract many attentions and interests both from practitioners and researchers. In such systems, parts are transported from a workstation to another by a material handling hoist. The existing literature mainly addressed how to find an optimal cyclic schedule to minimize the cycle time that measures the productivity of the lines. The material handling cost is an important factor that needs to be considered in practice but seldom addressed in the literature. This study focuses on a biobjective cyclic hoist scheduling problem to minimize the cycle time and the material handling cost simultaneously. We consider the reentrant workstations that are usually encountered in real-life lines but inevitably make the part-flow more complicated. The problem is formulated as a biobjective linear programming model with a given hoist move sequence and transformed into finding a set of Pareto optimal hoist move sequences with respect to the bicriteria. To obtain the Pareto optimal or near-optimal front, a hybrid discrete differential evolution (DDE) algorithm is proposed. In this hybrid evolutional algorithm, the population is divided into several subpopulations according to the maximal work-in-process (WIP) level of the system and the sizes of subpopulations are dynamically adjusted to balance the exploration and exploitation of the search. We propose a constructive heuristic to generate initial subpopulations with different WIP levels, hybrid mutation and crossover operators, an evaluation method that can tackle infeasible individuals and a one-to-one greedy tabu selection method. Computational results on both benchmark instances and randomly generated instances show that our proposed hybrid DDE algorithm outperforms the basic DDE algorithm and can solve larger-size instances than the existing ε-constraint method. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Several products must follow a brewing process which is composed by three main stages: coction, fermentation, and conditioning. In the coction stage, there are multiple unrelated parallel machines, and in the fermentation and conditioning stages, there are several heterogeneous tanks. Additionally, during the production process, some maintenance operations must be scheduled. The problem can be seen as a parallel machine batch scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times. Due to the complex structure of the problem, we propose a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure to generate good quality solutions in a short computation time. Computational experiments are conducted with real and artificial instances. The solutions obtained for the real instances show that the proposed algorithm reaches better solutions than the current solutions generated by the decision maker at the brewery, and the computation time required by our algorithm is dramatically shorter than the one required by the company. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.},

	abstract = {Abstract In modern data centers, power consumed by network is an observable portion of the total energy budget and thus improving the energy efficiency of data center networks (DCNs) truly matters. One effective way for this energy efficiency is to make the size of DCNs elastic along with traffic demands by flow consolidation and bandwidth scheduling, i.e., turning off unnecessary network components to reduce the power consumption. Meanwhile, having the instinct support for data center management, software defined networking (SDN) provides a paradigm to elastically control the resources of DCNs. To achieve such power savings, most of the prior efforts just adopt simple greedy heuristic to reduce computational complexity. However, due to the inherent problem of greedy algorithm, a good-enough optimization cannot be always guaranteed. To address this problem, a modified hybrid genetic algorithm (MHGA) is employed to improve the solution's accuracy, and the fine-grained routing function of SDN is fully leveraged. The simulation results show that more efficient power management can be achieved than the previous studies, by increasing about 5% of network energy savings. © 2017 The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications},

	abstract = {In this research we study the berth allocation problem (BAP) in real time as disruptions occur. In practice, the actual arrival times and handling times of the vessels deviate from their expected or estimated values, which can disrupt the original berthing plan and possibly make it infeasible. We consider a given baseline berthing schedule, and solve the BAP on a rolling planning horizon with the objective to minimize the total realized cost of the updated berthing schedule, as the actual arrival and handling time data is revealed in real time. The uncertainty in the data is modeled by making appropriate assumptions about the probability distributions of the uncertain parameters based on past data. We present an optimization-based recovery algorithm based on set partitioning and a smart greedy algorithm to reassign vessels in the event of disruption. Our research problem derives from the real-world issues faced by the Saqr port, Ras Al Khaimah, UAE, where the berthing plans are regularly disrupted owing to a high degree of uncertainty in information. A simulation study is carried out to assess the solution performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithms, in which the baseline schedule is the solution of the deterministic BAP without accounting for any uncertainty. Results indicate that the proposed reactive approaches can significantly reduce the total realized cost of berthing the vessels as compared to the ongoing practice at the port. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

To solve the real-life instances, two heuristic methods are proposed specifically for the considered problem. Firstly, genetic algorithm coupled with a greedy heuristic and later, block-based evolutionary algorithm (BBEA) is employed. After applying both techniques, we obtain the optimised schedule for loading of rakes and allotment of stockyard space for vessels as well as rakes at the terminal. Finally, we test the results of both models in three traffic scenarios between themselves and with real-life data from a port situated along the Eastern coast of India. The study resulted in significant reduction of turnaround time for rakes at the port terminal, which in turn lead to monetary savings.

The main issue discussed in this paper is lot-splitting of jobs and tradeoff between lot-splitting costs and makespan. One of the disadvantages of ACO is its uncertainty on time of convergence. In order to enrich search patterns of ACO and improve its performance, five enhancements are made in the proposed algorithms including: A new type of pheromone and greedy heuristic function; Three new functions of state transition rules; A nimble local search algorithm for the improvements of solution quality; Mutation mechanism for divisive searching; A particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm for adaptive tuning of parameters. The objectives that are used to measure the quality of the generated schedules are weighted-sum of makespan, tardiness of jobs and lot-splitting cost. The developed algorithms are analyzed extensively on real-world data obtained from a printing company and simulated data. A mathematical programming model is developed and paired-samples t-tests are performed between obtained solutions of mathematical programming model and proposed algorithms in order to verify effectiveness of proposed algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This article presents a novel algorithm for the generation of multiple short-term production schedules for an open-pit mine, in which several objectives, of varying priority, characterize the quality of each solution. A short-term schedule selects regions of a mine site, known as ‘blocks’, to be extracted in each week of a planning horizon (typically spanning 13 weeks). Existing tools for constructing these schedules use greedy heuristics, with little optimization. To construct a single schedule in which infrastructure is sufficiently utilized, with production grades consistently close to a desired target, a planner must often run these heuristics many times, adjusting parameters after each iteration. A planner's intuition and experience can evaluate the relative quality and mineability of different schedules in a way that is difficult to automate. Of interest to a short-term planner is the generation of multiple schedules, extracting available ore and waste in varying sequences, which can then be manually compared.

	abstract = {Buffer management and delivery latency in various networks have been extensively studied. However, little work has considered the condition in which the traffic exhibits interpacket dependency, a common occurrence with many applications. Furthermore, the existing work related to such traffic mainly focuses on maximizing goodput and little attention has been paid to delivery latency. This paper concentrates on the delivery latency minimization problem for streaming data with packet dependencies. A novel optimization model is proposed to describe the aforementioned problem and the theoretical lower bound for delivery latency is deduced. Based on this model, a plain buffer management (PBM) algorithm is applied to the implementation of the buffer scheduling process. Afterwards, we improve the PBM algorithm under the guidance of a heuristic idea and put forward an optimal buffer management greedy (OBMG) algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that the OBMG algorithm outperforms the currently best known online (BKO) algorithm as it decreases the average delivery latency by 35.6%. In some cases, delivery latency obtained from the OBMG algorithm can be quite close to the theoretical lower bound. In addition, the OBMG algorithm can reduce CPU computational overhead by more than 12% in comparison to the BKO algorithm. © Copyright 2016 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.},

With the explosion of connected devices, it is essential for conversion gateway between the Internet and sensor nodes to support end-to-end (e2e) interoperability because the current Internet Protocol (IT) does not support end-to-end delay in IEEE 802.15.4e. As part of IoT, we propose a scheduling scheme of multiple channels and multiple timeslots to minimize the e2e delay in multi-hop environments. The proposed greedy heuristic approach is compared with the meta-heuristics in terms of the given end-to-end delay bound. Although the meta-heuristics is more accurate in finding a global optimum or sub-optimal values than the greedy heuristic approach, this advantage comes at the expense of high complexity. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduces the complexity by obtaining suboptimal solutions that satisfy the e2e delay requirement. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Problems of this type can be found in semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities (wafer fabs). In addition, we consider precedence constraints among the jobs. Such constraints arise, for example, in scheduling subproblems of the shifting bottleneck heuristic when complex job shop scheduling problems are tackled. We use the total weighted tardiness as the performance measure to be optimized. Hence, the problem is NP-hard and we have to rely on heuristic solution approaches. We consider a variable neighborhood search (VNS) scheme and a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) to compute efficient solutions. We assess the performance of the two metaheuristics based on a large set of randomly generated problem instances and based on instances from the literature. The obtained computational results demonstrate that VNS is a very fast heuristic that quickly leads to high-quality solutions, whereas the GRASP is slightly outperformed by the VNS approach. However, the GRASP approach has the advantage that it can be parallelized in a more natural manner compared to VNS. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {We investigate the influence of different algorithmic choices on the approximation ratio in selfish scheduling. Our goal is to design local policies that minimize the inefficiency of resulting equilibria. In particular, we design optimal coordination mechanisms for unrelated machine scheduling, and improve the known approximation ratio from O(m) to O(logm), where m is the number of machines. A local policy for each machine orders the set of jobs assigned to it only based on parameters of those jobs. A strongly local policy only uses the processing time of jobs on the same machine. We prove that the approximation ratio of any set of strongly local ordering policies in equilibria is at least (m). In particular, it implies that the approximation ratio of a greedy shortest-first algorithm for machine scheduling is at least (m). This closes the gap between the known lower and upper bounds for this problem and answers an open question raised by Ibarra and Kim (1977) [Ibarra OH, Kim CE (1977) Heuristic algorithms for scheduling independent tasks on nonidentical processors. J. ACM 24(2):280-289.], and Davis and Jaffe (1981) [Davis E, Jaffe JM (1981) Algorithms for scheduling tasks on unrelated processors. J. ACM 28(4):721-736.]. We then design a local ordering policy with the approximation ratio of O(logm) in equilibria, and prove that this policy is optimal among all local ordering policies. This policy orders the jobs in the nondecreasing order of their inefficiency, i.e., the ratio between the processing time on that machine over the minimum processing time. Finally, we show that best responses of players for the inefficiency-based policy may not converge to a pure Nash equilibrium, and present a O(logm2m) policy for which we can prove fast convergence of best responses to pure Nash equilibria. © 2015 INFORMS.},

The results show that in addition to the suggested heuristic having much shorter running times than the exact algorithm, the error gap between them is small for a substantial proportion of almost 4500 benchmark instances taken from the literature. The proposed heuristic also has a more robust behaviour than the best heuristic for the MOSP, although less accurate.

In order acceptance and scheduling contexts, it is assumed that the production capacity of a company is overloaded. The problem is therefore to decide which orders to accept and how to sequence their production. In contrast with the existing literature, the considered problem jointly takes into account the following features: earliness and tardiness penalties (which can be linear or quadratic), sequence-dependent setup times and costs, rejection penalties, and the possibility of having idle times. The practical relevance of this new NP-hard problem is discussed and various solution methods are proposed, ranging from a basic greedy algorithm to refined metaheuristics (e.g., tabu search, the adaptive memory algorithm, population-based approaches loosely inspired on ant algorithms). The methods are compared for instances with various structures containing up to 200 jobs. For small linear instances, the metaheuristics are favorably compared with an exact formulation using CPLEX 12.2.

	abstract = {We consider the NP-hard problem of scheduling n jobs in F identical parallel flow shops, each consisting of a series of m machines, and doing so with a blocking constraint. The applied criterion is to minimize the makespan, i.e., the maximum completion time of all the jobs in F flow shops (lines). The Parallel Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (PFSP) is conceptually similar to another problem known in the literature as the Distributed Permutation Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (DPFSP), which allows modeling the scheduling process in companies with more than one factory, each factory with a flow shop configuration. Therefore, the proposed methods can solve the scheduling problem under the blocking constraint in both situations, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been studied previously. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model along with some constructive and improvement heuristics to solve the parallel blocking flow shop problem (PBFSP) and thus minimize the maximum completion time among lines. The proposed constructive procedures use two approaches that are totally different from those proposed in the literature. These methods are used as initial solution procedures of an iterated local search (ILS) and an iterated greedy algorithm (IGA), both of which are combined with a variable neighborhood search (VNS). The proposed constructive procedure and the improved methods take into account the characteristics of the problem.

	abstract = {The Cloud Computing paradigm focuses on the provisioning of reliable and scalable infrastructures (Clouds) delivering execution and storage services. The paradigm, with its promise of virtually infinite resources, seems to suit well in solving resource greedy scientific computing problems. The goal of this work is to study private Clouds to execute scientific experiments coming from multiple users, i.e., our work focuses on the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model where custom Virtual Machines (VM) are launched in appropriate hosts available in a Cloud. Then, correctly scheduling Cloud hosts is very important and it is necessary to develop efficient scheduling strategies to appropriately allocate VMs to physical resources. The job scheduling problem is however NP-complete, and therefore many heuristics have been developed. In this work, we describe and evaluate a Cloud scheduler based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The main performance metrics to study are the number of serviced users by the Cloud and the total number of created VMs in online (non-batch) scheduling scenarios. Besides, the number of intra-Cloud network messages sent are evaluated. Simulated experiments performed using CloudSim and job data from real scientific problems show that our scheduler succeeds in balancing the studied metrics compared to schedulers based on Random assignment and Genetic Algorithms. © 2015 Civil-Comp Ltd. and Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {A modified genetic algorithm (GA) is presented for the solution of the economic manpower shift planning (EMSP) problem. This is an NP-hard capacity planning problem arising in various industrial settings including the packing stage of production in process industries and maintenance operations. Given a set of independent jobs, their production targets, and a planning horizon, EMSP seeks the manpower to be planned for each workday shift in order to complete all the jobs within the specified time horizon at minimum cost. These are the key innovative aspects of the developed GA: (1) it uses a problem-specific encoding of the solution structure at the genotypic level; (2) it adopts a special greedy algorithm for mapping genotypes to phenotypes (i.e., to actual EMSP solutions); (3) it employs an adaptive parameter control scheme to adjust the mutation rate during its run. Extensive experiments over various industrial simulated environments and comparisons with the best existing EMSP heuristic (namely the block planning greedy algorithm) show the superiority of the proposed solution approach in terms of solution quality. Furthermore, comparisons to the results obtained by the standard CPLEX optimizer showed the proposed solution's performance to be very satisfactory. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {The correctness of a real-time system does not depend on the correctness of its calculations alone but also on the non-functional requirement of adhering to deadlines. Guaranteeing these deadlines by static timing analysis, however, is practically infeasible for current microarchitectures with out-of-order scheduling pipelines, several hardware threads, and multiple (shared) cache layers. Novel timing-analyzable features are required to sustain the strongly increasing demand for processing power in real-time systems. Recent advances in timing analysis have shown that runtime-reconfigurable instruction set processors are one way to escape the scarcity of analyzable processing power while preserving the flexibility of the system. When moving calculations from software to hardware by means of reconfigurable custom instructions (CIs) - additional to a considerable speedup - the overestimation of a task's worst-case execution time (WCET) can be reduced. CIs typically implement functionality that corresponds to several hundred instructions on the central processing unit (CPU) pipeline. While analyzing instructions for worst-case latency may introduce pessimism, the latency of CIs - executed on the reconfigurable fabric - is precisely known. In this work, we introduce the problem of selecting reconfigurable CIs to optimize the WCET of an application. We model this problem as an extension to state-of-the-art integer linear programming (ILP)-based program path analysis. This way, we enable optimization based on accurate WCET estimates with integration of information about global program flow, for example, infeasible paths. We present an optimal solution with effective techniques to prune the search space and a greedy heuristic that performs a maximum number of steps linear in the number of partitions of reconfigurable area available. Finally, we show the effectiveness of optimizing the WCET on a reconfigurable processor by evaluating a complex multimedia application with multiple reconfigurable CIs for several hardware parameters. © 2016 ACM.},

This article incorporates this contradiction into a problem of multi-objective optimization in tracking networks where multiple sensor nodes are scheduled for collaborative target tracking by adopting the unscented Kalman filter algorithm. We propose an effective scheme to extend the lifespan of wireless sensor networks while guaranteeing preset tracking quality. More specifically, with regard to practical circumstances, we perform analysis on the target detection probability, as well as residual energy of sensor nodes, when selecting a suitable set of candidate sensor nodes. Then, we put forward a novel energy-balanced sensor nodes scheduling algorithm, Greedy Balance Replace Heuristic Algorithm, to select a near-optimal task sensor set from the candidate sensor node set to balance tracking quality and network lifetime. In addition, we also design an efficient multi-sensor node collaborative method to track a single target and to timely report its state to the remote end. From simulation results, it is demonstrated that the proposed node scheduling scheme can not only maintain the preset tracking accuracy but also extend network lifespan with a low computation complexity. © The Author(s) 2017.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the Electric Vehicle (EV) Scheduling and Optimal Charging Problem. More precisely, given a fleet of EVs and Combustion Engine Vehicles (CVs), a set of tours to be processed by vehicles and a charging infrastructure, the problem aims to optimise the assignment of vehicles to tours and minimise the charging cost of EVs while considering several operational constraints mainly related to chargers, electricity grid and EVs driving range. We prove that the Electric Vehicle Scheduling and Charging Problem (EVSCP) is NP-hard in the ordinary sense. We provide a mixed-integer linear programming formulation to model the EVSCP and use CPLEX to solve small and medium instances. To solve large instances, we propose two heuristics: a Sequential Heuristic (SH) and a Global Heuristic (GH). The SH considers the EVs sequentially. To each EV, it assigns a set of tours and guarantees the feasibility of a charging schedule. Then, it generates an optimal charging schedule for this EV. However, the GH computes, in the first step, a feasible assignment of tours to all EVs. In the second step, it applies a global Min-Cost-Flow-based charging algorithm to minimise the charging cost of the EVs fleet. To evaluate the efficiency of our solving approaches, computational results on a large set of real and randomly generated test instances are reported and compared. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Due to the recent inflow of electric vehicles (EVs) to the automobile market, new concerns have risen with respect to the additional electrical load and the resultant effects on an overloaded electric grid. It takes approximately three to four hours to fully charge the battery of some common EVs depending on battery capacities. Either for convenience purposes or possibly necessity due to limited electric range on EVs, some EV owners may desire to charge their EV while at work in addition to charging at home. These forward-thinking daytime charging providers are typically Commercial and Industrial (C&I) electric ratepayers, or other large electric consumers which constitute the majority of businesses, shopping centers, academic campuses and manufacturing facilities. C&I consumers generally pay for electricity consumption based not only on total energy consumed, but also on peak electric demand measurements because certain portions of the working day are traditionally associated with C&I peak load periods. Electricity consumption during these periods results in higher electricity costs due to differences in the billing structures. Therefore, uncontrolled EV charging in large numbers potentially creates significant peak demand increases resulting in higher electric costs for the C&I ratepayer and exacerbating grid issues relating to electric generation and grid stability. Proper scheduling of EV charging is a necessity to avoid such increases in peak electric demand. Scheduling can be implemented in a number of ways including traditional process control strategies such as model predictive control or machine scheduling algorithms. When viewed as a parallel machine scheduling problem, charging stations can be considered as identical machines and the EV charging transactions required can be seen as jobs with varying processing times and due dates. The goal of such an algorithm is to schedule EV charging so that total electricity cost is minimized but off-peak charging activity is maximized. Due to the nature of electricity billing structures and cost calculations for C&I ratepayers, the machine scheduling algorithm must use time index based operations. This paper examines the EV charge scheduling problem and casts it as a parallel machine scheduling problem with availability constraints. Particularly, this study develops several heuristic scheduling algorithms such as Greedy Local Search and Simulated Annealing. These algorithms are evaluated using MATLAB (Mathworks MATLAB R2012b, 2012) to compare performance. In addition, the general-purpose optimization solver CPLEX (Ibm, ILOG CPLEX, 2012) is used to determine exact solutions for small size problems, which is then used to benchmark the performance of the other algorithms studied. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Coordinated scheduling is an efficient resource allocation technique employed to improve the throughput, utilization, and energy efficiency of radio networks. This work focuses on the coordinated scheduling problem for cloud radio access network (CRAN). In particular, we consider the downlink of a CRAN where a central cloud performs the scheduling and synchronization of transmitting frames across the base stations (BSs). For each BS, the transmit frame is composed of several time/frequency slots called resource blocks (RBs). We formulate an optimization problem for joint users to BS association and resource allocation with an objective to maximize the overall network utilization under practical network constraints. The formulated problem is combinatorial and an optimal solution of such a problem can be obtained by performing an exhaustive search over all possible users-to-BSs assignments that satisfy the network constraints. However, the size of search space increases exponentially with the number of users, BSs, and RBs, thus making this approach prohibitive for networks of practical size. This work proposes an interference-aware greedy heuristic algorithm for the constrained coordinated scheduling problem. The complexity analysis of the proposed heuristic is also presented and performance is compared with the optimal exhaustive search algorithm. Simulation results are presented for various network scenarios which demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves performance comparable to the optimal exhaustive search algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.},

Maintenance operations improve machine conditions, but also occupy potential production time, possibly delaying the customer orders. Therefore, one challenge is to determine the joint maintenance and production schedule to minimize the combined costs of maintenance and lost production over the long term. In this paper, we address the problem of integrated maintenance and production scheduling in a deteriorating multi-machine production system over multiple periods. Assuming that at the beginning of each period the demand becomes known and machine conditions are observable, we formulate a Markov decision process model to determine the maintenance plan and develop sufficient conditions guaranteeing its monotonicity in both machine condition and demand. We then formulate an integer programming model to find the maintenance and the production schedule in each period. Our computational results show that exploiting online condition monitoring information in maintenance and production decisions leads to 21% cost savings on average compared to a greedy heuristic and that the benefit of incorporating long-term information in making short-term decisions is highest in industries with medium failure rates. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the highway pavement rehabilitation scheduling and toll pricing issues over a planning horizon. In the highway system concerned, two types of agents are considered, namely highway operator and road users. Two models, which account for different highway regulatory regimes (i.e. public and private), are proposed. In the public regulatory model, the government aims to maximize total discounted social welfare of the transportation system over the planning horizon by determining the optimal pavement rehabilitation schedule and toll level. In the private regulatory regime, a profit-driven private operator seeks to optimize the pavement rehabilitation schedule and toll level to maximize its own discounted net profit over the planning horizon. The proposed models treat the interactions between the highway operator and the road users in the system as a bi-level hierarchical problem in which the upper level is a multi-period pavement rehabilitation scheduling and toll pricing problem, while the lower level is a multi-period route choice equilibrium problem. A heuristic solution algorithm that combines a greedy approach and a sensitivity analysis based approach is developed to solve the proposed bi-level multi-period optimization models. An illustrative example is used to show the applications of the proposed models. The findings show that the highway regulatory regime, pavement deterioration parameter and the roughness-induced vehicle operating cost can significantly affect the pavement rehabilitation schedules and the toll level as well as the performance of transportation system in terms of total life-cycle travel demand, net profit and social welfare. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Flow-shop scheduling problem is an attractive subject in the scheduling field, which has attracted the attention of many researchers in the past five decades. However, few studies focused on non-permutation flow-shop problems with time lag consideration. In the present work, the non-permutation flow-shop scheduling problem with time lags has been studied to minimize the makespan as a performance measure. First, we obtain a near-optimal permutation solution using the permutation flow-shop problem (PFSP) heuristic. Then, an effective iterated greedy heuristic, which can identify high-quality non-permutation solutions, is presented. Using the neighbourhood non-PFSP searching heuristic, we searched for non-PFSP schedules using the proposed heuristic algorithms in the second stage. Finally, the computational results were used to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed heuristic. The proposed heuristics were able to find near optimal non-PFSP solutions with very short computational time. Thus, the proposed algorithms is efficient and can be used in industrial applications. Moreover, the proposed heuristic algorithms are very simple to implement, which is attractive for industrial applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Permutation Flowshop Scheduling Problem (PFSP) is among the most investigated scheduling problems in the fields of Operational Research (OR) and management science. During the last six decades, it has gained much attention and interest thanks to its applicability in a variety of domains such as industrial engineering and economics. Recently, the PFSP with multi-factory environment has been proposed in shop scheduling sphere. Since the problem is known to be NP-hard, exact algorithms can be extremely costly, computationally speaking. Chemical Reaction Optimization (CRO) is lastly proposed by Lam and Li (2010) to optimize hard combinatorial problems. Due to its ability to escape from local optima, CRO has demonstrated excellent performance in solving a variety of scheduling problems, such as flexible job-shop scheduling, grid scheduling, network scheduling etc. In such a paper, we address the Distributed Permutation Flowshop Scheduling Problem (DPFSP) with an artificial chemical reaction metaheuristic which objective is to minimize the maximum completion time. In the proposed CRO, the effective NEH heuristic is adapted to generate the initial population of molecules. Furthermore, a well-designed One-Point (OP) crossover and an effective greedy strategy are embedded in the CRO algorithm in order to ameliorate the solution quality. Moreover, the influence of the parameter setting on the CRO algorithm is being investigated on the base of the Taguchi method. To validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, intensive experiments are carried out on 720 large instances which are extended from the well known Taillard benchmark. The results prove the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in comparison with some powerful algorithms. It is also seen that more than 200 best-known solutions are improved. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

We use a simple system partitioning and processor allocation scheme, which always schedules as many parallel tasks as possible for simultaneous execution. We use two heuristic algorithms for scheduling independent parallel tasks in the same level, i.e., SIMPLE and GREEDY. We adopt a two-level energy/time/power allocation scheme, namely, optimal energy/time allocation among levels of tasks and equal power supply to tasks in the same level.

	abstract = {This study addresses the problem of scheduling a set of n jobs with arbitrary job sizes and non-zero ready times on a set of m unrelated parallel batch machines with different capacities so as to minimize the makespan. Unrelated parallel machines is the most general case of parallel machine environments where each machine processes each job at a different speed. In the studied problem, each machine can process several jobs simultaneously as a batch as long as the machine capacity is not exceeded. The batch processing time and the batch ready time are respectively equal to the largest processing time and the largest ready time among all the jobs in the batch. In this paper, we first provide a lower bound for the problem and a mixed integer programming (MIP) model. To solve the problem, a meta-heuristic based on the iterated greedy (IG) algorithm is proposed. IG is a simple meta-heuristic which generates a sequence of solutions by iterating over a greedy constructive heuristic using destruction and construction operations. In the recent literature this meta-heuristic has been employed to solve a considerable number of combinatorial optimization problems. This is because IG is easy to implement and it often exhibits an excellent performance. The effectiveness of the proposed IG algorithm is evaluated and compared by computational experiments on a large benchmark of randomly generated instances. The obtained results indicate that the proposed algorithm has a superior performance compared to some meta-heuristic algorithms proposed for similar problems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

We also analyze the performance of SG user capacity for 5G single cell multicast and multicast broadcast single frequency network.

The flexible consumers are modeled as discrete batch processes, and the associated optimization problem is denoted the discrete virtual power plant dispatch problem (DVPPDP). First, the nondeterministic polynomial time (NP)-completeness of the discrete virtual power plant dispatch problem is proved formally. We then proceed to develop tailored versions of the meta-heuristic algorithms hill climber and greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP). The algorithms are tuned and tested on portfolios of varying sizes. We find that all the tailored algorithms perform satisfactorily in the sense that they are able to find sub-optimal, but usable, solutions to very large problems (on the order of 105 units) at computation times on the scale of just 10 s, which is far beyond the capabilities of the optimal algorithms we have tested. In particular, GRASP sorted shows with the most promising performance, as it is able to find solutions that are both agile (sorted) and well balanced, and consistently yields the best numerical performance among the developed algorithms. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The standard optimal power flow (OPF) problem is an economic dispatch (ED) problem combined with transmission constraints, which are based on a static topology. Prior research has demonstrated that cooptimization of generation dispatch and transmission topology results in cost savings. However, the computational complexity associated with topology control (TC) has been a major deterrent to its implementation. The proposed work investigates the application of a heuristic, a greedy algorithm, to improve the computational time for the TC problem while still maintaining the ability to find quality solutions. An expression is derived, which indicates the impact on the objective for a marginal change in the state of a transmission line. This expression is used to generate a priority list with potential candidate lines for switching, which may provide huge improvements to the system. The advantage of this method is that it is a fast heuristic as compared to using mixed integer programming (MIP) to find a solution. The heuristic is tested on real-time applications such as N-1 events, N-m events (m simultaneous contingencies), and cascading events. The proposed algorithm specifically targets cases that lead to load shedding in the system and provides a quick and efficient method to restore the loads by improving the deliverability of reserves via TC. Simulation results on the IEEE 73 bus test system and the IEEE 118 bus test system suggest a significant improvement in the amount of load served to the system with TC as opposed to without TC with minimal time and computation. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {Sharing live multimedia content is becoming increasingly popular among mobile users. In this article, we study the problem of optimizing video quality in such a scenario using scalable video coding (SVC) and chunked video content. We consider using only standard stateless HTTP servers that do not need to perform additional processing of the video content. Our key contribution is to provide close to optimal algorithms for scheduling video chunk upload for multiple clients having different viewing delays. Given such a set of clients, the problem is to decide which chunks to upload and in which order to upload them so that the quality-delay tradeoff can be optimally balanced. We show by means of simulations that the proposed algorithms can achieve notably better performance than naive solutions in practical cases. Especially the heuristic-based greedy algorithm is a good candidate for deployment on mobile devices because it is not computationally intensive but it still delivers in most cases on-par video quality compared to the more complex local optimization algorithm. We also show that using shorter video segments and being able to predict bandwidth and video chunk properties improve the delivered video quality in certain cases. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The increasing frequency of destructive wildfires, with a consequent loss of life and property, has led to fire and land management agencies initiating extensive fuel management programs. This involves long-term planning of fuel reduction activities such as prescribed burning or mechanical clearing. In this paper, we propose a mixed integer programming (MIP) model that determines when and where fuel reduction activities should take place. The model takes into account multiple vegetation types in the landscape, their tolerance to frequency of fire events, and keeps track of the age of each vegetation class in each treatment unit. The objective is to minimise fuel load over the planning horizon. The complexity of scheduling fuel reduction activities has led to the introduction of sophisticated mathematical optimisation methods. While these approaches can provide optimum solutions, they can be computationally expensive, particularly for fuel management planning which extends across the landscape and spans long term planning horizons. This raises the question of how much better do exact modelling approaches compare to simpler heuristic approaches in their solutions. To answer this question, the proposed model is run using an exact MIP (using commercial MIP solver) and two heuristic approaches that decompose the problem into multiple single-period sub problems. The Knapsack Problem (KP), which is the first heuristic approach, solves the single period problems, using an exact MIP approach. The second heuristic approach solves the single period sub problem using a greedy heuristic approach. The three methods are compared in term of model tractability, computational time and the objective values. The model was tested using randomised data from 711 treatment units in the Barwon-Otway district of Victoria, Australia. Solutions for the exact MIP could be obtained for up to a 15-year planning only using a standard implementation of CPLEX. Both heuristic approaches can solve significantly larger problems, involving 100-year or even longer planning horizons. Furthermore there are no substantial differences in the solutions produced by the three approaches. It is concluded that for practical purposes a heuristic method is to be preferred to the exact MIP approach. © 2015, Rachmawati et al.},

It is assumed that in the realization of a schedule, job processing times may take any values from their corresponding intervals given before scheduling. The objective is to determine a robust schedule with the minimum makespan of the restricted worst-case scenario among all possible scenarios to hedge against processing time uncertainty for a given number of jobs. We formulate the problem of interest as a robust counterpart optimization model, and apply a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm and an iterated greedy (IG) algorithm to solve it. The experimental results show that both algorithms are effective in determining robust schedules for small-size problems, while the IG algorithm is more effective than the SA algorithm for large-size problems, albeit at the expense of more computational time. © 2015 Operational Research Society Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study attempts to develop an online chronic diseases consulting system by using a customized heuristic algorithm for complex scheduling of medical experts to consult patients in a major hospital. Methods: We proved this problem is NP-complete problem and used heuristic algorithms to solve it. When the data set is small, most existing algorithms can reach the optimal solution using linear programming. However, traditional greedy algorithm and off-trap strategy fail to give reasonable results in large data set. In this study, we used the algorithm with appropriate oblivion strategy for efficient convergence and optimal solution. Results: To compare different algorithms, synthetic data sets of different size and a year's clinical data set provided by the hospital were used. The outcome of our algorithm was closely matched to the optimal solution from linear programming for sixty synthetic data sets. In addition, our algorithm is more efficient than that of linear programming when clinical data set was used. Meanwhile we found that the outcome is an approximate optimal solution and the algorithm is able to save a lot of cost for the hospital in practice. Conclusions: In this paper, we analyzed the results obtained from the algorithms of data set of different size and found that the algorithm can handle large volumes of data efficiently and reduce cost of hospitals. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem in cognitive radio networks (CRN) is the following capacity maximization in CRN (CM-CRN) problem: given a set of primary links with a common transmitter, together with a set of secondary links, select a maximum cardinality subset of the links that can concurrently transmit successfully under the constraint that all primary links are selected. This problem is intrinsically different from the well-known link scheduling (LS) problem in wireless mesh networks, which does not have the constraint to select all primary links. In this paper, we make both theoretical and practical contributions to the CM-CRN problem. To achieve deep theoretical understanding of the problem, we show that CM-CRN is NP-hard and design a polynomial time approximation algorithm with a constant approximation ratio. In addition, we extend the designed algorithm to find approximate solutions to two variations of CM-CRN, one with the objective of maximizing the number of selected secondary links and the other with multiple primary users. To achieve good performance in practice, we design a simple but effective heuristic algorithm based on a greedy strategy. We also design an optimal algorithm based on integer linear programming, which serves as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of the approximation algorithm and heuristic algorithm, for problem instances of small sizes. Extensive evaluations show that our proved constant ratio of the approximation algorithm is considerably conservative and our heuristic algorithm produces results that are very close to the optimal solution. Our approximation algorithm for CM-CRN is motivated by and can be viewed as a non-trivial extension of the elegant approximation algorithm for the LS problem by Wan et al. to CRNs. © 1993-2012 IEEE.},

The GRASP metaheuristic is used for diversification and the mELS is used for intensification. Four different neighbourhood structures are formalised. A procedure for fast estimation of the neighbourhood quality is also proposed to accelerate local search phases. The metaheuristic has been tested on several datasets from the literature. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GRASP-mELS has achieved significant improvements for solving FJSP from the viewpoint of both quality of solutions and computation time.

High quality assignments can support airlines and airports in adhering to published schedules by minimising changes or delays while waiting for resources to become available. In this paper, we consider the problem of assigning available baggage sorting stations to flights which have already been scheduled and allocated to stands. A model for the problem is presented, and the different objectives which have to be considered are highlighted. A number of constructive algorithms for sorting station assignments are then presented and their effects are compared and analysed when different numbers of sorting stations are available. It can be observed that appropriate algorithm selection is highly dependent upon whether or not reductions in service time are permitted and upon the flight density in relation to the number of sorting stations. Finally, since these constructive approaches produce different solutions which are better for different trade-offs of the objectives, we utilise these as initial solutions for an evolutionary algorithm as well as for an Integer Linear Programming model in CPLEX. We show that in both cases they are helpful for improving the results which are obtainable within reasonable solution times. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {The need for low latency analysis over high-velocity data streams motivates the need for distributed continuous dataflow systems. Contemporary stream processing systems use simple techniques to scale on elastic cloud resources to handle variable data rates. However, application QoS is also impacted by variability in resource performance exhibited by clouds and hence necessitates autonomic methods of provisioning elastic resources to support such applications on cloud infrastructure. We develop the concept of 'dynamic dataflows' which utilize alternate tasks as additional control over the dataflow's cost and QoS. Further, we formalize an optimization problem to represent deployment and runtime resource provisioning that allows us to balance the application's QoS, value, and the resource cost. We propose two greedy heuristics, centralized and sharded, based on the variable-sized bin packing algorithm and compare against a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based heuristic that gives a near-optimal solution. A large-scale simulation study, using the linear road benchmark and VM performance traces from the AWS public cloud, shows that while GA-based heuristic provides a better quality schedule, the greedy heuristics are more practical, and can intelligently utilize cloud elasticity to mitigate the effect of variability, both in input data rates and cloud resource performance, to meet the QoS of fast data applications. © 2013 IEEE.},

In the FRCPSP, for each activity the given resource requirement is allocated in a variable number of contiguous periods in which the activity is processed. As the resource allocation can be adjusted between time periods, the resulting resource profile of the activity becomes flexible. The FRCPSP consists of scheduling activities and determining for each activity a resource profile and, thus, a duration in order to minimize the makespan. We propose a Hybrid Metaheuristic for the FRCPSP. It contains the Flexible Resource Profile Parallel Schedule Generation Scheme which employs the concepts of delayed scheduling and non-greedy resource allocation, embedded in a genetic algorithm. The best-found schedules are further improved in a variable neighborhood search by transferring resource quantities between selected activities. The results of a computational study demonstrate that the proposed method yields significantly better solutions than three benchmark methods on problem instances with up to 200 activities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an extension of the graph colouring problem is introduced to model a parallel machine scheduling problem with job incompatibility. To get closer to real-world applications, where the number of machines is limited and jobs have different processing times, each vertex of the graph requires multiple colours and the number of vertices with the same colour is bounded. In addition, several objectives related to scheduling are considered: makespan, number of pre-emptions and summation over the jobs’ throughput times. Different solution methods are proposed, namely, two greedy heuristics, two tabu search methods and an adaptive memory algorithm. The latter uses multiple recombination operators, each one being designed for optimising a subset of objectives. The most appropriate operator is selected dynamically at each iteration, depending on its past performance. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is effective and robust, while providing high-quality solutions on benchmark instances for the graph multi-colouring problem, a simplification of the considered problem. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

As a result, the algorithmic approaches to this PFSP variant have reached extremely high performance. Currently, one of the most effective algorithm for this problem is a structurally rather simple iterated greedy algorithm. In this paper, we explore the possibility of re-optimizing partial solutions obtained after the solution destruction step of the iterated greedy algorithm. We show that with this extension, the performance of the state-of-the-art algorithm for the PFSP under makespan criterion can be significantly improved and we give experimental evidence that the local search on partial solutions is the key component for the high performance of the algorithm. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper considers a hybrid flowshop scheduling problem (HFSP). Since this problem is NP-hard, most of literature has been centred on the analysis of meta-heuristics and hybridised procedures. However, intelligent manufacturing systems in actual industrial practices mostly prefer the use of simple algorithms. The greedy randomised adaptive search procedure (GRASP) is among the simplest approximation algorithms providing good results when solving hard combinatorial optimisation problems that currently exist in literature. The objective is to propose a GRASP to solve the classical HFSP under the optimisation of different objectives. The goal is not to solve a multi-objective problem, instead to design a solution procedure that performs well under various optimisation criteria. This performance is analysed through a set of computational experiments using well-known data-sets from the literature. The proposed GRASP obtains satisfactory results in comparison with traditional dispatching rules and can be easily implemented for efficient decision-making in real industrial practice. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Utilization of cloud computing resources has made a fast growth in e-business. Business and government agencies often need to handle large volume of service requests, the so-called instance-intensive business processes in a constrained period. On-time completion for instance-intensive business processes within the constrained time is a very important issue. In the past few years, traditional optimal task scheduling has been well researched and proven to be a nondeterministic polynomial (NP) time–complete problem. So many heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms are put forward to solve the issue with near-optimal solutions. However, most of them just treat a single workflow instance as a multistep task without considering that steps within a task can be different types of activities. To explain multistep features of business workflows, a typical motivating instance-intensive business example of security exchange and a multistep scheduling model for business workflows are introduced in this paper. Then our near-optimal dynamic priority scheduling (DPS) strategy is proposed on the basis of the idea of Min-Min heuristic algorithm and greedy philosophy. Compared to the first come first served and constrained Min-Min by makespan and standard deviation, DPS can make a more optimized choice in each round of scheduling towards overall outcome. To show the effectiveness of DPS, theoretical minimum execution time (METtheory) is used as a benchmark for evaluation based on simulation. The results show that the ratios between METtheory and DPS are more than 98.5% by scheduling different orders of magnitude tasks from 1000 to 1 000 000. In particular, the ratio between METtheory and DPS is nearly 99.9% with 1 000 000 tasks, which means that our DPS can get the near-optimal result when scheduling large number of tasks.

	abstract = {This paper proposes two constructive heuristics, i.e. HPF1 and HPF2, for the blocking flow shop problem in order to minimize the total flow time. They differ mainly in the criterion used to select the first job in the sequence since, as it is shown, its contribution to the total flow time is not negligible. Both procedures were combined with the insertion phase of NEH to improve the sequence. However, as the insertion procedure does not always improve the solution, in the resulting heuristics, named NHPF1 and NHPF2, the sequence was evaluated before and after the insertion to keep the best of both solutions. The structure of these heuristics was used in Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedures (GRASP) with variable neighborhood search in the improvement phase to generate greedy randomized solutions. The performance of the constructive heuristics and of the proposed GRASPs was evaluated against other heuristics from the literature. Our computational analysis showed that the presented heuristics are very competitive and able to improve 68 out of 120 best known solutions of Taillard's instances for the blocking flow shop scheduling problem with the total flow time criterion. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In the past few years, several greedy or heuristic algorithms have been proposed to cope with the scheduling problem in WMNs. However, their performance highly depends on the network topology and bandwidth requests, and they do not achieve optimal performance in all cases. This paper proposes an optimal scheduling algorithm called the scheduling algorithm with dynamic programming approach (SADP), which exploits the opportunities of spatial reuse and maximizes the network throughput based on the network topology and the uplink bandwidth requests of each subscriber station. In addition, a heuristic scheduling algorithm (HSA) is proposed to reduce the computing complexity. The performance results were approximate to the optimal results. The simulation study reveals that the proposed SADP provides the WMN with maximal throughput and shortest transmission time, and the proposed HSA likely achieves the optimal results. © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

The mathematical formulation of the problem is comprehensively discussed. Two different mixed integer linear programming models in form of sequence and position based variables are proposed. Using commercial software of CPLEX, the small sized problems are optimally solved. To solve large sized problems, besides adapting three well-known heuristics, three greedy heuristics are developed. The basic idea behind the developed heuristics is to iteratively insert operations (one at each iteration) into a sequence to build up a complete permutation of operations. The permutation scheme, although having several advantages, suffers from redundancy which is having many different permutations representing the same schedule. The issue is analyzed to recognize the redundant permutation. That improves efficiency of heuristics. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the two models and the six heuristics. The results show sequence based model and greedy heuristics equipped with redundancy exclusion are effective for the problem. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Job scheduling in utility grids should take into account the incentives for both grid users and resource providers. However, most of existing studies on job scheduling in utility grids only address the incentive for one party, i.e., either the users or the resource providers. Very few studies on job scheduling in utility grids consider incentives for both parties, in which the cost, one of the most attractive incentives for users, is not addressed. In this paper, we study the job scheduling in utility grid by optimizing the incentives for both parties. We propose a multi-objective optimization approach, i.e., maximizing the successful execution rate of jobs and minimizing the combined cost (incentives for grid users), and minimizing the fairness deviation of profits (incentive for resource providers). The proposed multi-objective optimization approach could offer sufficient incentives for the two parties to stay and play in the utility grid. A heuristic scheduling algorithm called Cost-Greedy Price-Adjusting (CGPA) algorithm is developed to optimize the incentives for both parties. Simulation results show that the CGPA algorithm is effective and could lead to higher successful execution rate, lower combined cost and lower fairness deviation compared with some popular algorithms in most cases. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.},

This problem is addressed as a whole by simultaneously scheduling the state of the servers and the cooling devices,and by scheduling the workload of the data center,which is comprised of a set of independent tasks with due dates. Its goal is to simultaneously minimize the energy consumption budget of the data center,the energy consumption deviation from a reference profile,and the amount of tasks whose due dates are violated. Two multi-objective evolutionary algorithms hybridized with a greedy heuristic are proposed and are enhanced by applying simulated annealing for post hoc optimization. Experimental results show that these methods are able to reduce energy consumption budget by about 60% while adequately following a power consumption profile and providing a high quality of service.

	abstract = {Recently, iterated greedy algorithms have been successfully applied to solve a variety of combinatorial optimization problems. This paper presents iterated greedy algorithms for solving the blocking flowshop scheduling problem (BFSP) with the makespan criterion. Main contributions of this paper can be summed up as follows. We propose a constructive heuristic to generate an initial solution. The constructive heuristic generates better results than those currently in the literature. We employ and adopt well-known speed-up methods from the literature for both insertion and swap neighborhood structures. In addition, an iteration jumping probability is proposed to change the neighborhood structure from insertion neighborhood to swap neighborhood. Generally speaking, the insertion neighborhood is much more effective than the swap neighborhood for the permutation flowshop scheduling problems. Instead of considering the use of these neighborhood structures in a framework of the variable neighborhood search algorithm, two powerful local search algorithms are designed in such a way that the search process is guided by an iteration jumping probability determining which neighborhood structure will be employed. By doing so, it is shown that some additional enhancements can be achieved by employing the swap neighborhood structure with a speed-up method without jeopardizing the effectiveness of the insertion neighborhood. We also show that the performance of the iterated greedy algorithm significantly depends on the speed-up method employed. The parameters of the proposed iterated greedy algorithms are tuned through a design of experiments on randomly generated benchmark instances. Extensive computational results on Taillard's well-known benchmark suite show that the iterated greedy algorithms with speed-up methods are equivalent or superior to the best performing algorithms from the literature. Ultimately, 85 out of 120 problem instances are further improved with substantial margins. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Various heuristic based methods are available in literature for optimally solving job shop scheduling problems (JSSP). In this research work a novel approach is proposed which hybridizes fast simulated annealing (FSA) with quenching. The proposed algorithm uses FSA for global search and quenching for localized search in neighborhood of current solution, while tabu list is used to restrict search from revisiting previously explored solutions. FSA is started with a relatively higher temperature and as search progresses temperature is gradually reduced to a value close to zero. The overall best solution (BS) is maintained throughout execution of the algorithm. If no improvement is observed in BS for certain number of iterations then quenching cycle is invoked. During quenching cycle current temperature is reduced to nearly freezing point and iterations are increased by many folds, as a result of this change search becomes nearly greedy. The strength of the proposed algorithm is that even in quenching mode escape from local optima is possible due to use of Cauchy probability distribution and non-zero temperature. At the completion of quenching cycle previous values of search parameters are restored and FSA takes over, which moves search into another region of solution space. Effectiveness of proposed algorithm is established by solving 88 well known benchmark problems taken form published work. The proposed algorithm was able to solve 45 problems optimally to their respective best known values in reasonable time. The proposed algorithm has been compared with 18 other published works. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient in finding solution to JSSP. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {An ad hoc network can be set up by a number of units without the need of any permanent infrastructure. Two units establish a communication link if the channel quality is sufficiently high. As not all pairs of units can establish direct links, traffic between two units may have to be relayed through other units. This is known as the multi-hop functionality. In military command and control systems, ad hoc networks are also referred to as multi-hop radio networks. Spatial TDMA (STDMA) is a scheme for access control in ad hoc networks. STDMA improves TDMA by allowing simultaneous transmission of multiple units. In this paper, we study the optimization problem of STDMA scheduling, where the objective is to find minimum-length schedules. Previous work for this problem has focused on heuristics, whose performance is difficult to analyze when optimal solutions are not known. We develop novel mathematical programming formulations for this problem, and present a column generation solution method. Our numerical experiments show that the method generates a very tight bound to the optimal schedule length, and thereby enables optimal or near-optimal solutions. The column generation method can be used to provide benchmarks when evaluating STDMA scheduling algorithms. In particular, we use the bound obtained in the column generation method to evaluate a simple greedy algorithm that is suitable for distributed implementations. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Tardiness is actually a difficult criterion to deal with, even in a relatively simple manufacturing system, such as a single-machine is strongly NP-hard. Motivated by the computational complexity of this problem, a simple iterated greedy (IG) heuristic is proposed to solve it. To validate and verify the proposed IG heuristic, computational experiments were conducted on three benchmark problem sets that included weighted and un-weighted tardiness problems. The experiment results clearly indicate that the proposed IG heuristic is highly effective as compared to the state-of-the-art meta-heuristics on the same benchmark instances.

This temporary storage area is composed of parallel temporary storage units with distinct capacities. The storage operation of a job, also called a batch, has to answer time restrictions such as release dates, due dates, restricted family dependent setup times and time lags, and also a space constraint which is the capacity of the temporary storage unit. The goal is to schedule the batches on the storage units in order to minimize the total setup times and the maximum lateness. First, we model the problem on a single storage unit as a two-machine flowshop problem with a limited buffer capacity and we show that it is NP-hard. We also show that the particular case in which no lateness is allowed is solvable in polynomial time under special conditions on the buffer capacity, both for single or parallel temporary storage units. Next we provide three heuristics: a greedy algorithm, a hybrid heuristic based on Ant Colony Optimization and Simulated Annealing and finally a dedicated heuristic. The latter strongly exploits the structural properties shown in this paper. We provide experimental results which highlight the efficiency of the dedicated heuristic in comparison with the two other heuristics. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider low complexity user scheduling algorithms for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output systems employing successive zero-forcing precoding. Optimal scheduling involves an exhaustive search (ES), which is prohibitively complex. Greedy algorithms (GrAs) with heuristic scheduling metrics achieve performance close to that of the ES. Meanwhile, genetic algorithms (GAs) are a rapid suboptimal option of optimising utility (e.g. scheduling) metrics. Herein, we evaluate the performance and complexity of greedy and genetic scheduling algorithms for successive zeroforcing. We also propose and evaluate two hybrid algorithms combining the traits of the GrA and GA. The algorithms' performance is assessed through a series of computer simulations. We demonstrate both the GrA and GA achieve a nearoptimal sum rate with low complexity, whereas the hybrid algorithms further enhance the GrA and GA performance without an increase in the order of complexity.

To solve this problem which has been proved to be strongly NP-hard, a combination between an ant colony algorithm, a heuristic algorithm and a local search procedure is proposed and presented. The hybrid approach is to use artificial ants to construct solutions by applying a stochastic greedy rule based on the Gupta’s heuristic and pheromone trails. A local search is then performed to improve the performance quality of constructed solutions. Once all ants have terminated their generations, the pheromone trails are modified according to a global updating rule. The proposed algorithm is applied to benchmark problems taken from the literature and compared with other metaheuristics. Computational experiments are given to demonstrate the superiority of the algorithm in the quality of solution and CPU time. © 2010, the authors.},

	abstract = {The placement machine is the bottleneck of a printed circuit board (PCB) assembly line. The type of machine considered in this paper is the beam-type placement machine that can simultaneously pick up several components from feeders. It is assumed that the number of nozzle types (NTs) is less than the number of heads on the beam. The objective of the PCB assembly scheduling for a single placement machine is to minimize the cycle time based on the average machine operation time instead of the travelling distance. To minimize the cycle time, the number of turns and the number of pickups should be minimized. The PCB assembly scheduling is hierarchically decomposed into four problems: the nozzle assignment problem, the head allocation problem, the component type (CT) grouping problem and the pickup clustering problem, which are optimized successively and iteratively. First, the nozzle assignment problem considering alternative NTs for one CT is dealt with by the proposed genetic algorithm. For a given nozzle assignment solution, the head allocation problem is solved by a previously greedy heuristic to minimize the number of turns.Then, the CT grouping problem and the pickup clustering problem are solved by a proposed greedy heuristic and a modified agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach, respectively, to minimize the number of pickups. Numerical experiments are carried out to examine the performances of these proposed heuristic approaches. The importance of considering alternative NTs for one CT for the cycle time is also confirmed. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

We consider the optimisation problem of scheduling de-icing vehicles that is one of the key supporting logistic flows in the turn-around process of aircraft. The objective is to minimise the delay of flights due to de-icing, and the travel distance of the de-icing vehicles. We study the complexity of the problem, and develop a solution algorithm using greedy randomised adaptive search. A case study of real-life data from Stockholm Arlanda Airport shows that optimised schedule leads to significantly better performance in comparison to intuitive and simple scheduling strategies. The benefit of optimisation in reducing the waiting time for de-icing is further demonstrated via dynamic simulations. © 2012 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Few studies have employed fuzzy approach to solve multi-objective UPMSPs. In the research, several schemes are incorporated into the algorithm, including (1) matching-based decoding; (2) acceptance rule based on Pareto dominance, objective fitness, or Pareto reference point distance; (3) random or fixed weighted direction search. The matching-based decoding scheme has two phases: first max-min matching and then Hungarian method. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the algorithms' performance for moderate to large problem size instances. The results indicate that matching-based decoding scheme significantly improves solution quality, but will require more computation time. GRASP with path relinking performs slightly worse than objective fitness-based multi-objective simulated annealing algorithms (MOSA), but better than Pareto dominance-based MOSA in terms of several Pareto performance measures. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a variable iterated greedy algorithm (IG) with differential evolution (vIG-DE), designed to solve the no-idle permutation flowshop scheduling problem. In an IG algorithm, size d of jobs are removed from a sequence and re-inserted into all possible positions of the remaining sequences of jobs, which affects the performance of the algorithm. The basic concept behind the proposed vIG-DE algorithm is to employ differential evolution (DE) to determine two important parameters for the IG algorithm, which are the destruction size and the probability of applying the IG algorithm to an individual. While DE optimizes the destruction size and the probability on a continuous domain by using DE mutation and crossover operators, these two parameters are used to generate a trial individual by directly applying the IG algorithm to each target individual depending on the probability. Next, the trial individual is replaced with the corresponding target individual if it is better in terms of fitness. A unique multi-vector chromosome representation is presented in such a way that the first vector represents the destruction size and the probability, which is a DE vector, whereas the second vector simply consists of a job permutation assigned to each individual in the target population. Furthermore, the traditional IG and a variable IG from the literature are re-implemented as well. The proposed algorithms are applied to the no-idle permutation flowshop scheduling (NIPFS) problem with the makespan and total flowtime criteria. The performances of the proposed algorithms are tested on the Ruben Ruiz benchmark suite and compared to the best-known solutions available at http://soa.iti.es/rruiz as well as to those from a recent discrete differential evolution algorithm (HDDE) from the literature. The computational results show that all three IG variants represent state-of-art methods for the NIPFS problem. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Our main contributions include: i) the concept of stream allocation to flows based on their traffic demands or class, ii) stream allocation to flows in the network utilizing single user or multiuser MIMO communication, iii) achieving the proportional fairness of the stream allocation in the minimum possible schedule length, and iv) performance comparison of the stream scheduling in the network for single user and multiuser communication and the tradeoff involved therein. We first formulate demand-based fair stream allocation as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem whose solution is a schedule that is guaranteed to be contention-free. We then solve this ILP in conjunction with binary search to find a minimum length contention-free schedule that achieves the fairness goals. We show that an implementation of our algorithm for a number of sample topologies in fact yields minimum length schedules that achieve the fairness goals. We then give performance comparison results that show the benefit of multiuser MIMO links over single user links at higher traffic workloads in the network. Finally, we also give a greedy heuristic for stream scheduling and compare its performance with the ILP-based algorithm in terms of the fairness goals achieved in a given schedule length. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

It is a multi-start or iterative process, in which each GRASP iteration consists of two phases, a construction phase, in which a feasible solution is produced, and a local search phase, in which a local optimum in the neighborhood of the constructed solution is sought. Since 1989, numerous papers on the basic aspects of GRASP, as well as enhancements to the basic metaheuristic, have appeared in the literature. GRASP has been applied to a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems, ranging from scheduling and routing to drawing and turbine balancing. This is the second of two papers with an annotated bibliography of the GRASP literature from 1989 to 2008. In the companion paper, algorithmic aspects of GRASP are surveyed. In this paper, we cover the literature where GRASP is applied to scheduling, routing, logic, partitioning, location, graph theory, assignment, manufacturing, transportation, telecommunications, biology and related fields, automatic drawing, power systems, and VLSI design. © 2009 International Federation of Operational Research Societies.},

	abstract = {In hard real-time systems timeliness is as important as functional correctness. Such systems contain so called hard real-time tasks (HRT tasks) which must be finished by a given deadline. One of the methods of scheduling of HRT tasks is periodic loading introduced by Schweitzer, Dror, and Trudeau. The paper presents an extension to that method which allows for deterministic utilization of cache memory in hard real-time systems. It is based on a new version of the Knapsack problem named Knapsack-Lightening. In the paper the Knapsack-Lightening problem is defined, its complexity is analyzed, and an exact algorithm along with two heuristics are presented. Moreover the application of the Knapsack-Lightening problem to scheduling HRT tasks is described.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with a special case of the Vehicle Re-Scheduling Problem (VRSP) for passenger railways in case of emergencies. These emergencies arise when a service line is disturbed due to a huge and unexpected demand which exceeds the service line capacity. In order to provide a proper response to this type of emergency, an on-line optimization model based on a discrete-event simulation model is proposed to provide and support decisions about reassigning vehicles from other lines of the transport system to the disturbed line. The simulation model is based on a dynamic network loading model, a dynamic demand generation model, and a schedule-based service network. The on-line optimization model has been solved using two greedy heuristics which automatically generate near-optimal decisions about vehicle reassignments considering the total time in system for passengers as the minimization criterion. An experimental study, based on a synthetic network and the Madrid Regional Railway network, shows that the second proposed heuristic provides near-optimal reassignment decisions with short computation times compatible with real-time use. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of scheduling semiconductor burn-in operations, where burn-in ovens are modelled as batch processing machines. Most of the studies assume that ready times and due dates of jobs are agreeable (i.e., ri implies d3). In many real world applications, the agreeable property assumption does not hold. Therefore, in this paper, scheduling of a single burn-in oven with non-agreeable release times and due dates along with non-identical job sizes as well as non-identical processing of time problem is formulated as a Non-Linear (0-1) Integer Programming optimisation problem. The objective measure of the problem is minimising the maximum completion time (makespan) of all jobs. Due to computational intractability, we have proposed four variants of a two-phase greedy heuristic algorithm. Computational experiments indicate that two out of four proposed algorithms have excellent average performance and also capable of solving any large-scale real life problems with a relatively low computational effort on a Pentium IV computer.

	abstract = {The linear ordering problem (LOP) is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with a wide range of applications in economics, archaeology, the social sciences, scheduling, and biology. It has, however, drawn little attention compared to other closely related problems such as the quadratic assignment problem and the traveling salesman problem. Due to its computational complexity, it is essential in practice to develop solution approaches to rapidly search for solution of high-quality. In this paper we propose a new algorithm based on a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) to efficiently solve the LOP. The algorithm is integrated with a Path-Relinking (PR) procedure and a new local search scheme. We tested our implementation on the set of 49 real-world instances of input-output tables (LOLIB instances) proposed in Reinelt (Linear ordering library (LOLIB) 2002). In addition, we tested a set of 30 large randomly-generated instances proposed in Mitchell (Computational experience with an interior point cutting plane algorithm, Tech. rep., Mathematical Sciences, Rensellaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY 12180-3590, USA 1997). Most of the LOLIB instances were solved to optimality within 0.87 seconds on average. The average gap for the randomly-generated instances was 0.0173% with an average running time of 21.98 seconds. The results indicate the efficiency and high-quality of the proposed heuristic procedure. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Once the blocking plan and train schedule have been obtained, the next step is to determine which trains should carry which blocks. This problem, known as the block-to-train assignment problem, is considered in this paper. We provide two formulations for this problem: an arc-based formulation and a path-based formulation. The latter is generally smaller than the former, and it can better handle practical constraints. We also propose exact and heuristic algorithms based on the path-based formulation. Our exact algorithm solves an integer programming formulation with CPLEX using both a priori generation and dynamic generation of paths. Our heuristic algorithms include a Lagrangian relaxation-based method as well as a greedy construction method. We present computational results of our algorithms using the data provided by a major US railroad. We show that we can obtain an optimal solution of the block-to-train assignment problem within a few minutes of computational time, and can obtain heuristic solutions with 1-2% deviations from the optimal solutions within a few seconds. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Greedy scheduling heuristics provide a low complexity and scalable albeit particularly sub-optimal strategy for hardware-based crossbar schedulers. In contrast, the maximum matching algorithm for Bipartite graphs can be used to provide optimal scheduling for crossbar-based interconnection networks with a significant complexity and scalability cost. In this paper, we show how maximum matching can be reformulated in terms of Boolean operations rather than the more traditional formulations. By leveraging the inherent parallelism available in custom hardware design, we reformulate maximum matching in terms of Boolean operations rather than matrix computations and introduce three maximum matching implementations in hardware. Specifically, we examine a Pure Logic Scheduler with three dimensions of parallelism, a Matrix Scheduler with two dimensions of parallelism and a Vector Scheduler with one dimension of parallelism. These designs reduce the algorithmic complexity for an N × N network from O (N3) to O (1), O (K), and O (K N), respectively, where K is the number of optimization steps. While an optimal scheduling algorithm requires K = 2 N - 1 steps, by starting with our hardware-based greedy strategy to generate an initial schedule, our simulation results show that the maximum matching scheduler can achieve 99% of the optimal schedule when K = 9. We examine hardware and time complexity of these architectures for crossbar sizes of up to N = 1024. Using FPGA synthesis results, we show that a greedy schedule for crossbars, ranging from 8×8 to 256×256, can be optimized in less than 20 ns per optimization step. For crossbars reaching 1024×1024 the scheduling can be completed in approximately 10 μs with current technology and could reach under 90 ns with future technologies. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we present a new greedy heuristic for the SGP, based on the intuitive concept of freedom among players. We use this heuristic in a complete backtracking search, and match the best current results of constraint solvers for several SGP instances with a much simpler method. We then use the main idea of the heuristic to construct initial configurations for a metaheuristic approach, and show that this significantly improves results obtained by local search alone. In particular, our method is the first metaheuristic technique that can solve the original problem instance optimally. We show that our approach is also highly competitive with other metaheuristic and constraint-based methods on many other benchmark instances from the literature. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

To solve this problem which has been proved to be strongly NP-hard, a combination between an ant colony algorithm, a heuristic algorithm and a local search procedure is proposed and presented. The hybrid approach is to use artificial ants to construct solutions by applying a stochastic greedy rule based on the Gupta's heuristic and pheromone trails. A local search is then performed to improve the performance quality of constructed solutions. Once all ants have terminated their generations, the pheromone trails are modified according to a global updating rule. The proposed algorithm is applied to benchmark problems taken from the literature and compared with other metaheuristics. Computational experiments are given to demonstrate the superiority of the algorithm in the quality of solution and CPU time. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

According to the Association of American Railroad's study, rail companies move more than 40% of the nation's total freight. Given the fact that the freight railway industry is already running without much excess capacity, better planning and scheduling tools are needed to effectively manage the scarce resources, in order to cope with the rapidly increasing demand for railway transportation. This research develops optimization-based approaches for scheduling of freight trains. Two mathematical formulations of the scheduling problem are first introduced. One assumes the path of each train, which is the track segments each train uses, is given and the other one relaxes this assumption. Several heuristics based on mixtures of the two formulations are proposed. The proposed algorithms are able to outperform two existing heuristics, namely a simple look-ahead greedy heuristic and a global neighborhood search algorithm, in terms of railway total train delay. For large networks, two algorithms based on the idea of decomposition are developed and are shown to significantly outperform two existing algorithms. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {We consider the utility-maximization problem in the downlink of wireless mesh networks with orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). We formulate this problem as a cross-layer design of joint rate control and OFDMA scheduling to efficiently utilize the scarce radio resources. The problem is decoupled into a rate-control problem at the transport layer and a channel-aware and queue-aware scheduling problem at the Media Access Control/physical layer (MAC/PHY). The rate-control problem adjusts arrival rates to the base station (BS) queues, and the scheduling problem determines link rates, i.e., departure rates from the BS and other network nodes, through subcarrier and modulation rate assignment. Although the rate-control problem is locally solved at the BS, we propose a greedy algorithm that solves the scheduling problem in a distributed manner, at network nodes. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm for fast execution of the scheduling scheme at individual nodes. Numerical results show that the heuristic algorithm performs comparably with the greedy algorithm, whereas it has lower computational complexity. In addition, our proposed scheduling scheme, when it cooperates with the rate-control mechanism, improves the network performance in terms of end-to-end delay, aggregate utility, and fairness. © 2006 IEEE.},

The objective is to maximise the workload balance among transporters under the time constraint that all assembly blocks should be transported in the predetermined period. We develop the GRASP algorithm for transporter scheduling, because parallel machine scheduling with sequence-dependent setup times and precedence constraints is an NP-hard problem. Through simulation experiments, we analyse some aspects of the developed GRASP algorithm, and compare the developed GRASP algorithm with other heuristics for large-scale instances and the optimal solution approach for small-sized instances.

A sequence-dependent setup time is required between lots of different products. The products are assumed to be all continuously divisible or all discrete. The criterion is to minimize the time at which all the demands are satisfied, Cmax, or the maximum lateness of the product completion times from the given due dates, Lmax. The problem is motivated by the real-life scheduling applications in multi-product plants. The properties of optimal solutions, NP-hardness proofs, enumeration, and dynamic programming algorithms for various special cases of the problem are presented. A greedy-type heuristic is proposed and experimentally tested. The major contributions are an NP-hardness proof, pseudo-polynomial algorithms linear in m for the case, in which the number of products is a given constant and the heuristic. The results can be adapted for solving a production line design problem. Copyright © "IIE".},

Communication and sensing consume energy, therefore, efficient power management can extend network lifetime. In this paper, we consider a large number of sensors randomly deployed to monitor a number of targets. Each target may be redundantly covered by multiple sensors. To conserve energy, we organise sensors in sets activated sucessively. In this paper, we introduce the Connected Set Covers(CSC) problem that has as objective finding a maximum number of set covers such that each sensor node to be activated is connected to the Base Station (BS). A sensor can participate in multiple sensor sets, but the total energy spent in all sets is constrained by the initial energy reserves. We show that the CSC problem is NP-complete and we propose three solutions: an Integer Programming (IP)-based solution, a greedy approach and a distributed and localised heuristic. Simulation results that validate our approaches are also presented. Copyright © 2008 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {We propose new heuristics along with an augmented-neural-network (AugNN) formulation for solving the makespan minimization task-scheduling problem for the non-identical machine environment. We explore four task and three machine-priority rules, resulting in 12 combinations of single-pass heuristics. The task-priority rules are Highest-Level-First (HLF), Highest-Total-Remaining-Processing-Time-First (HTRPTF), Smallest-Latest-Finish-Time-First (SLFTF) and Minimum-Slack-First (MSF). For machine priority, we propose a greedy rule called Fastest-Available-Machine-First (FAMF), and two non-greedy rules: (1) Fastest-Available-Machine-First-With-Conditional-Wait-1 (FAMF-CW-1), and (2) Fastest-Available-Machine-First-With-Conditional-Wait-2 (FMF-CW-2). The AugNN approach integrates neural-network learning with domain and problem specific knowledge through heuristics, to produce good results. A single-pass heuristic is embedded in a neural network designed specifically for each problem. We give the AugNN formulation for each of the 12 heuristics and show computational results on 100 randomly generated problems of sizes ranging from 20 to 70 tasks and 2 to 5 machines. Results demonstrate that AugNN provides significant improvement over single-pass heuristics. The reduction in the gap between the obtained solution and the lower-bound due to AugNN over single-pass heuristics ranged from 24.4% to 50%. As far as heuristics, the non-greedy machine-priority rules performed significantly better than the greedy rule. The average gaps for the non-greedy rules ranged from 16.1% to 23.5% compared to 33.7% to 40.4% for greedy. For AugNN, for non-greedy rules, the gap ranged from 11.5% to 15.5% compared to 18.4% to 25.0% for greedy. The HLF and HTRPTF task priority rules performed better than the other two. The HTRPTF/FAMF-CW-1 combination gave the best results, closely followed by HLF/FAMF-CW-2 and HTRPTF/FAMF-CW-2 combinations. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we propose two new IG algorithms for a complex flowshop problem that results from the consideration of sequence dependent setup times on machines, a characteristic that is often found in industrial settings. The first IG algorithm is a straightforward adaption of the IG principle, while the second incorporates a simple descent local search. Furthermore, we consider two different optimization objectives, the minimization of the maximum completion time or makespan and the minimization of the total weighted tardiness. Extensive experiments and statistical analyses demonstrate that, despite their simplicity, the IG algorithms are new state-of-the-art methods for both objectives. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In our earlier work Simulated Annealing (SA_RCP) outperformed other meta-heuristics, like, Genetic Algorithm, Tabu Search, Particle Swarm Optimization and its variant in solving benchmark instances of this problem. Having been inspired by this result we have further developed new hybrids of Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search. In this work, we have proposed five more methods developed by combining Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search and applied them for solving a benchmark instance of this problem. The results show that Simulated Annealing incorporated with Tabu List, Greedy Selection Heuristic and aspiration criteria (GTSA_AC_RCP) outperforms other methods in getting optimal results with maximum hit and minimum fluctuations. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

	abstract = {Compilers perform instruction scheduling to improve the performance of code on modern computer architectures. Superblocks-a straight-line sequence of code with a single entry point and multiple possible exit points-are a commonly used scheduling region within compilers. Superblock scheduling is NP-complete, and is done suboptimally in production compilers using a greedy algorithm coupled with a heuristic. Recently, exact schedulers have also been proposed. In this paper, we perform an extensive computational study of heuristic and exact techniques for scheduling superblocks. Our study extends previous work in using a more realistic architectural model, in not assuming perfect profile information, and in systematically investigating the case where profile information is not available. Our experimental results show that heuristics can be brittle and what looks promising under idealized (but unrealistic) conditions may not be robust in practice. As well, for the case where profile information is not available, some methods clearly dominate. Notably, a much inferior method is deployed in at least one existing compiler. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

It built ship stowage and loading scheduling model. The model propounded a ship loading scheduling strategy with heuristic greedy algorithm. The heuristic information in the heuristic greedy algorithm was the number and losses of the stacked container, bonus and fitness of the target container. The whole ship loading plan of container terminal was worked out by choosing the container having the least cost from yard during every schedule. The classification strategy and stacking strategy in bay were proposed in the ship stowage model. Based on these strategies, a scheduling model of ship stowage was established. A genetic algorithm which bases on group coding method and the stacking strategy in bay which bases on the greedy algorithm were proposed as the resolution of the ship stowage model. It can be concluded that combinatorial optimization algorithm and strategies were efficient and effective as the approach to ship stowage scheduling of container terminal from the analysis of the experiment's results. © 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

The algorithms described in this paper can be thought of as which belongs to a layer in the corresponding control-communication-computational system, which is responsible for generating timed trajectories for individual vehicles [S. Graham, G. Baliga, and P. Kumar, "Issues in the convergence of control with communication and computing: Proliferation, architecture, design, services, and middleware," in Proceedings of CDC '04, Nassau, Bahamas, December 2004]. Each vehicle has a specified route from its origin to its destination, and the task of the scheduler is to provide timed trajectories for all vehicles, which follow the respective vehicles' routes and further ensure that no collisions or deadlock will result. The authors' approach reduces the problem to a discrete-time graph-scheduling problem, by defining an appropriate graph to model the road network. Their main result is a sufficient condition on the graph of the road network and on the initial distribution of vehicles, under which there exists a scheduling algorithm that is guaranteed to clear the system in finite time. The nature of this result allows the design of provably correct scheduling algorithms that require only a small portion of future routes of all vehicles to be known, and are consequently able to work in real time. The authors also address the optimization of performance with respect to delay, by focusing on the "one-step move" problem. Finding an optimal solution for the one-step problem would provide a greedy solution of the original network-wide scheduling problem, but is itself NP-hard. They present a polynomial time heuristic algorithm and evaluate its performance through simulations. © 2006 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We study the robust transmission scheduling and power control problem for spectrum sharing between secondary and primary users in a spatial reuse time-division multiple access (STDMA) network. The objective is to find a robust minimum-length schedule for secondary users (in terms of time slots) subject to the interference constraints for primary users and the traffic demand of secondary users. We consider the fact that power allocation based on average (or estimated) link gains can be improper since actual link gains can be different from the average link gains. Therefore, transmission of the secondary links may fail and require more time slots. We also consider this demand uncertainty arising from channel gain uncertainty. We propose a column generation-based algorithm to solve the scheduling and power control problem for secondary users. The column generation method breaks the problem down to a restricted master problem and a pricing problem. However, the classical column generation method can have convergence problem due to primal degeneracy. We propose an improved column generation algorithm to stabilize and accelerate the column generation procedure by using the perturbation and exact penalty methods. Furthermore, we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm for the pricing problem based on a greedy algorithm. For the simulation scenario considered in this paper, the proposed stabilized column generation algorithm can obtain the optimal schedules with 18.85% reduction of the number of iterations and 0.29% reduction of the number of time slots. Also, the heuristic algorithm can achieve the optimality with 0.39% of cost penalty but 1.67 × 10 4 times reduction of runtime. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A novel hybrid discrete particle swarm optimization (HDPSO) algorithm is proposed in this paper to solve the no-idle permutation flow shop scheduling problems with the criterion to minimize the maximum completion time (makespan). Firstly, two simple approaches are presented to calculate the makespan of a job permutation. Secondly, a speed-up method is proposed to evaluate the whole insert neighborhood of a job permutation with (n-1)2 neighbors in time O(mn 2), where n and m denote the number of jobs and machines, respectively. Thirdly, a discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm based on permutation representation and a local search algorithm based on the insert neighborhood are fused to enhance the searching ability and to balance the exploration and exploitation. Then, computational simulation results based on the well-known benchmarks and statistical performance comparisons are provided. It is concluded that the proposed HDPSO algorithm is not only superior to two recently published heuristics, the improved greedy (IG) heuristic and Kalczynski-Kamburowski (KK) heuristic, in terms of searching quality, but also superior to the single DPSO algorithm and the PSO algorithm with variable neighborhood search (PSOvns) in terms of searching quality, robustness and efficiency. © 2007 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

We address the associated medium access problem and propose a scheduling technique that activates hyperarcs rather than links, as in classical scheduling approaches. We encapsulate the constraints on valid network configurations in a conflict graph model and formulate a joint optimization problem taking into account both the network coding subgraph and the schedule. Next, using Lagrangian relaxation, we decompose the overall problem into two subproblems, a multiple-shortest-paths problem and a maximum weighted stable set (MWSS) problem. We show that if we use a greedy heuristic for the MWSS part of the problem, the overall algorithm is completely distributed. We provide extensive simulation results for both the centralized optimal and the decentralized algorithms. The optimal algorithm improves performance by up to a factor of two over widely used techniques such as orthogonal or two-hop-constrained scheduling. The decentralized algorithm is shown to buy its distributed operation with some throughput losses. Experimental results on randomly generated networks suggest that these losses are not large. Finally, we study the power consumption of our scheme and quantify the tradeoff between power and bandwidth efficiency. © 2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A greedy randomised adaptive search procedure (GRASP) is an iterative multi-start metaheuristic for difficult combinatorial optimisation. The GRASP iteration consists of two phases: a construction phase, in which a feasible solution is found and a local search phase, in which a local optimum in the neighbourhood of the constructed solution is sought. In this paper, a GRASP algorithm is presented to solve the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSSP) with limited resource constraints. The main constraint of this scheduling problem is that each operation of a job must follow an appointed process order and each operation must be processed on an appointed machine. These constraints are used to balance between the resource limitation and machine flexibility. The model objectives are the minimisation of makespan, maximum workload and total workload. Representative benchmark problems are solved in order to test the effectiveness and efficiency of the GRASP algorithm. The computational result shows that the proposed algorithm produced better results than other authors' algorithms. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {The broadcast scheduling problem (BSP) in wireless ad-hoc networks is a well-known NP-complete combinatorial optimization problem. The BSP aims at finding a transmission schedule whose time slots are collision free in a wireless ad-hoc network with time-division multiple access (TDMA). The transmission schedule is optimized for minimizing the frame length of the node transmissions and maximizing the utilization of the shared channel. Recently, many metaheuristics can optimally solve smaller problem instances of the BSP. However, for complex problem instances, the computation of metaheuristics can be quite time and memory consuming. In this work, we propose a greedy genetic algorithm for solving the BSP with a large number of nodes. We present three heuristic genetic operators, including a greedy crossover and two greedy mutation operators, to optimize both objectives of the BSP. These heuristic genetic operators can generate good solutions. Our experiments use both benchmark data sets and randomly generated problem instances. The experimental results show that our genetic algorithm is effective in solving the BSP problem instances of large-scale networks with 2,500 nodes. © 2013 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.},

In this adaptation, a completely different decoding operator is applied, and hybridized with an effective local search and another temperature calculation procedure.

	abstract = {This paper presents a new prediction-based forwarding protocol for complex and dynamic delay tolerant networks (DTNs). The proposed protocol is called GrAnt (Greedy Ant), as it uses the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) metaheuristic with a greedy transition rule. This allows GrAnt to select the most promising forwarder nodes or allow for the exploitation of previously found good paths. The main motivation for using ACO is to take advantage of its population-based search and the rapid adaptation of its learning framework. Considering data from heuristic functions and pheromone concentration, the GrAnt protocol includes three modules: routing, scheduling, and buffer management. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unicast protocol that employs a greedy ACO and that (1) infers best promising forwarders from nodes' social connectivity, (2) determines the best paths a message must follow to eventually reach its destination while limiting message replications and droppings, and (3) performs message transmission scheduling and buffer space management. GrAnt is compared to the Epidemic and PROPHET protocols in two different mobility scenarios: one activity-based scenario (Working Day) and another based on Points of Interest. Simulation results obtained by the ONE simulator show that, in both scenarios, GrAnt achieves a higher delivery ratio, lower message redundancy, and fewer dropped messages than Epidemic or PROPHET. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We consider the deterministic lightpath scheduling problem in which the whole set of lightpath demands is completely known in advance. The objective is to maximize the number of established lightpaths for a given number of wavelengths. Since this problem has been shown to be NP complete, various heuristic algorithms have been developed to solve it suboptimally. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic RWA algorithm for SLDs based on the bee colony optimization (BCO) metaheuristic. BCO is a newborn swarm intelligence metaheuristic approach recently proposed to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. We compare the efficiency of the proposed algorithm with three simple greedy algorithms for the same problem. Numerical results obtained by numerous simulations performed on the widely used realistic European Optical Network topology indicate that the proposed algorithm produces better-quality solutions compared to those obtained by greedy algorithms. In addition, we compare the results of the BCO-RWA-SLD algorithm with four other heuristic/metaheuristic algorithms proposed in literature to solve the RWA problem in the case of permanent (static) traffic demands. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

This paper presents a discrete artificial bee colony algorithm hybridized with a variant of iterated greedy algorithms to find the permutation that gives the smallest total flowtime. Iterated greedy algorithms are comprised of local search procedures based on insertion and swap neighborhood structures. In the same context, we also consider a discrete differential evolution algorithm from our previous work. The performance of the proposed algorithms is tested on the well-known benchmark suite of Taillard. The highly effective performance of the discrete artificial bee colony and hybrid differential evolution algorithms is compared against the best performing algorithms from the existing literature in terms of both solution quality and CPU times. Ultimately, 44 out of the 90 best known solutions provided very recently by the best performing estimation of distribution and genetic local search algorithms are further improved by the proposed algorithms with short-term searches.

In the permutational scenario, the sequence of jobs has to remain the same in all machines. The Flowshop Problem (FSP) is known to be NP-hard when more than three machines are considered. Thus, for medium and large scale instances, high-quality heuristics are needed to find good solutions in reasonable time. We propose and analyse parallel hybrid search methods that fully use the computational power of current multi-core machines. The parallel methods combine a memetic algorithm (MA) and several iterated greedy algorithms (IG) running concurrently. Two test scenarios were included, with short and long CPU times. The tests were conducted on the set of benchmark instances introduced by Taillard (Eur. J. Oper. Res. 64:278-285, 1993), commonly used to assess the performance of new methods. Results indicate that the use of the MA to manage a pool of solutions is highly effective, allowing the improvement of the best known upper bound for one of the instances. © 2012 Springer Science & Business Media, LLC.},

In the case of the traveling time of service crew from one aircraft parking place to another to be nonignorable, the scheduling optimization problem of ground service can be described as a vehicle routing problem with time windows of multiply nonidentical vehicles. To solve the problem, we propose a genetic algorithm with a hybrid encoding scheme. The encoding scheme describes the bit of a chromosome as a positive real number. Its integer part stands for the assigned crew of a flight and its decimal part for the position in job sequence by percent. The encoding scheme integrates assignment and sequence information in one number. Thus, it can be conveniently processed by all genetic operations of crossover, mutation, selection, and reproduction. A greedy heuristic is embedded as the sequencing initialization and reinitialization tool in the genetic algorithm procedure. The genetic algorithm is used to solve a lot of examples from a practical aircraft service company. The achieved results show that the algorithm is efficient. © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a new mathematical programming model and assignment algorithms are developed for minimizing the schedule length in adaptive power and adaptive rate link scheduling in spatial-TDMA wireless networks. The underlying problem entails the optimal joint scheduling of transmissions across multi-access communication links combined with the simultaneous allocation of transmit power levels and data rates across active links, while meeting required Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) levels at intended receivers. We prove that the problem can be modeled as a Mixed Integer-Linear Programming (MILP) and show that the latter yields a solution that consists of transmit power levels that are strongly Pareto Optimal. We note this problem to be NP-complete. For comparison purposes, we employ the MILP formulation for computing the optimal schedule for networks with small number of designated links and limited number of data rate levels. We proceed to develop and investigate a heuristic algorithm of polynomial complexity for solving the problem in a computationally effective manner. The algorithm is based on the construction of a Power Controlled Rate adaptation Interference Graph. The desired schedule is then derived by using a greedy algorithm to construct an independence set from this graph. Based on system analyses, we show, for smaller illustrative networks, the performance behavior realized by the heuristic algorithms to generally be in the 75 percentile of those attained by the optimal schedule. We also show that performance of our heuristic algorithm is on average 20% better than that attained under prior algorithms that were developed for use under fixed transmit power and fixed rate link scheduling. © 2006 IEEE.},

Firstly, individuals of the DDE algorithm are represented as discrete job permutations, and new mutation and crossover operators are developed. Secondly, a local search algorithm based on insert neighbourhood is embedded in the DDE algorithm to balance the exploration and exploitation and to enhance the local searching ability. In addition, we present two simple approaches to calculate makespan and a speed-up method for insert neighbourhood to improve the efficiency of the whole algorithm. Computational simulations and comparisons based on some well-known benchmarks demonstrate that the DDE algorithm is not only superior to the improved greedy and Kalczynski-Kamburowski heuristics in terms of searching quality, but also superior to the particle swarm optimisation and differential evolution algorithms according to searching quality, robustness and efficiency. © 2008, Inderscience Publishers.},

Our goal for this class of applications is to optimize a user-specified benefit function while meeting the time deadline. Our first contribution in this paper is a multi-objective optimization algorithm for scheduling the application onto the most efficient and reliable resources. In this way, the processing can achieve the maximum benefit while also maximizing the success-rate, which is the probability of finishing execution without failures. However, for the cases where failures do occur, we have developed a hybrid failure recovery scheme to ensure that the application can complete within the pre-specified time interval. Our experimental results show that our scheduling algorithm can achieve better benefit when compared to several heuristics-based greedy scheduling algorithms, while still having a negligible overhead. Benefit is further improved when we apply the hybrid failure recovery scheme, and the success-rate becomes 100%. © 2010 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with solving the single machine total weighted tardiness problem with sequence dependent setup times by a discrete differential evolution algorithm developed by the authors recently. Its performance is enhanced by employing different population initialization schemes based on some constructive heuristics such as the well-known NEH and the greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) as well as some priority rules such as the earliest weighted due date (EWDD) and the apparent tardiness cost with setups (ATCS). Additional performance enhancement is further achieved by the inclusion of a referenced local search (RLS) in the algorithm together with the use of destruction and construction (DC) procedure when obtaining the mutant population. Furthermore, to facilitate the greedy job insertion into a partial solution which will be employed in the NEH, GRASP, DC heuristics as well as in the RLS local search, some newly designed speed-up methods are presented for the insertion move for the first time in the literature. They are novel contributions of this paper to the single machine tardiness related scheduling problems with sequence dependent setup times. To evaluate its performance, the discrete differential evolution algorithm is tested on a set of benchmark instances from the literature. Through the analyses of experimental results, its highly effective performance with substantial margins both in solution quality and CPU time is shown against the best performing algorithms from the literature, in particular, against the very recent newly designed particle swarm and ant colony optimization algorithms of Anghinolfi and Paolucci [A new discrete particle swarm optimization approach for the single machine total weighted tardiness scheduling problem with sequence dependent setup times.

The iterated greedy metaheuristic generates a sequence of solutions by iterating over a constructive heuristic using destruction and construction phases.

This is because it is based on a very simple principle, it is easy to implement, and it often exhibits an excellent performance. Moreover, scalability for high-dimensional problems becomes an essential requirement for modern optimisation algorithms.

	abstract = {It is well known that link level throughput could be significantly increased by using multiple antennae at the transmitter and receiver without increasing the bandwidth and power budget. However, optimizing the link level performance of multiple-antenna systems does not always imply achieving system level optimization. Therefore, cross-layer optimization across the link layer and the scheduling layer is very important to fully exploit the temporal and spatial dimensions of the communication channel. In this paper, we consider the optimal downlink space-time scheduling design for a general class of convex utility functions. The access point or base station is equipped with nT transmit antennas. There are K mobiles in the system with a single receive antenna. For practical reasons, we assume zero-forcing processing at the physical layer of the base station and mobile. We will apply the design framework to two common utility functions, namely the maximum throughput and the proportional fair. The cross-layer scheduling design is a mixed convex and combinatorial optimization problem and the search space of the optimalsolution is enormous. Greedy algorithm, which has been widely used in today's wireless data systems (3G1X, high data rate system (HDR), Universal Mobile Terrestrial Service), is optimal when nT = 1. However, we found that there is a large performance penalty of greedy algorithms (relative to optimal performance) when nT > 1 and this motivates the search for more efficient heuristics. In this paper, we will address genetic-based heuristics and discuss their complexity-performance tradeoff. © 2005 IEEE.},

Hyperheuristics, or heuristics to choose heuristics, are higher-level algorithms that operate on low-level heuristics, which in turn work in the solution domain. In this paper, a GRASP-inspired hyperheuristic is proposed for solving the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP), one of the most important challenges facing construction project schedulers. The hyperheuristic is the main component of a multilevel procedure that runs within a commercial project management software system. On the basis of simple moves such as swap and replace, the low-level heuristics operate on the priority values that the software uses for scheduling activities. The efficiency of this prioritization-based algorithm has been addressed through a series of computational experiments on randomly generated projects.

We present a hybrid electromagnetism-like (HEM) algorithm for the permutation flowshop scheduling with sequence dependent setup times that have shown superior performance against other meta-heuristics when applied to proposed problem. The proposed HEM algorithm benefits of a new concept named priority assigning to calculate electrostatic force and also it implements a new formulation for solution charge. Using a good approach for acquiring the initial solutions and also some effective local searches to finding neighborhood solutions are other novelties of the HEM.

Expert Systems with Applications, 29(3), 705-712], the sub-population genetic algorithm (SPGA) is effective in solving multiobjective scheduling problems. Based on the pioneer efforts, this research proposes a mining gene structure technique integrated with the SPGA. The mining problem of elite chromosomes is formulated as a linear assignment problem and a greedy heuristic using threshold to eliminate redundant information. As a result, artificial chromosomes are created according to this gene mining procedure and these artificial chromosomes will be reintroduced into the evolution process to improve the efficiency and solution quality of the procedure. In addition, to further increase the quality of the artificial chromosome, a dynamic threshold procedure is developed and the flowshop scheduling problems are applied as a benchmark problem for testing the developed algorithm. Extensive tests in the flow-shop scheduling problem show that the proposed approach can improve the performance of SPGA significantly. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The link bandwidths in such networks are typically shared by multiple users through advance reservation, resulting in varying bandwidth availability in future time. Developing efficient scheduling algorithms for advance bandwidth reservation has become a critical task to improve the utilization of network resources and meet the transport requirements of application users. We consider an exhaustive combination of different path and bandwidth constraints and formulate four types of advance bandwidth scheduling problems, with the same objective to minimize the data transfer end time for a given transfer request with a prespecified data size: 1) fixed path with fixed bandwidth (FPFB); 2) fixed path with variable bandwidth (FPVB); 3) variable path with fixed bandwidth (VPFB); and 4) variable path with variable bandwidth (VPVB). For VPFB and VPVB, we further consider two subcases where the path switching delay is negligible or nonnegligible. We propose an optimal algorithm for each of these scheduling problems except for FPVB and VPVB with nonnegligible path switching delay, which are proven to be NP-complete and nonapproximable, and then tackled by heuristics. The performance superiority of these heuristics is verified by extensive experimental results in a large set of simulated networks in comparison to optimal and greedy strategies. © 1993-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The recourse to operation research solutions has strongly increased the performances of scheduling task in the High-Level Synthesis (called hardware compilation). Scheduling a whole program is not possible as too many constraints and objectives interact. We decompose high-level scheduling in three steps. Step 1: Coarse-grain scheduling tries to exploit parallelism and locality of the whole program (in particular in loops, possibly imperfectly nested) with a rough view of the target architecture. This produces a sequence of logical steps, each of which contains a pool of macro-tasks. Step 2: Micro-scheduling maps and schedules each macro-task independently taking into account all peculiarities of the target architecture. This produces a reservation table for each macro-task. Step 3: Fine-grain scheduling refines each logical step by scheduling all its macro-tasks. This paper focuses on the third step. As tasks are modeled as reservation tables, we can express resource constraints using dis-equations (i.e., negations of equations). As most scheduling problems, scheduling tasks with reservation tables to minimize the total duration is NP-complete. Our goal here is to design different strategies and to evaluate them, on practical examples, to see if it is possible to find optimal solution in reasonable time. The first algorithm is based on integer linear programming techniques for scheduling, which we adapt to our specific problem. Our main algorithmic contribution is an exact branch-and-bound algorithm, where each evaluation is accelerated by variant of Dijkstra's algorithm. A simple greedy heuristic is also proposed for comparisons. The evaluation and comparison are done on pieces of scientific applications from the PerfectClub and the HLSynth95 benchmarks. The results demonstrate the suitability of these solutions for high-level synthesis scheduling. © EDP Sciences.},

Rateless codes allow each node of the network to accumulate mutual information with every packet transmission. This enables a significant performance gain over conventional shortest path routing. Further, it also outperforms cooperative communication techniques that are based on energy accumulation. However, it creates complex and combinatorial networking decisions concerning which nodes participate in transmission, and which decode ordering to use. We formulate three problems of interest in this setting: (i) minimum delay routing, (ii) minimum energy routing subject to delay constraint, and (iii) minimum delay broadcast. All of these are hard combinatorial optimization problems and we make use of several structural properties of their optimal solutions to simplify the problems and derive optimal greedy algorithms. Although the reduced problems still have exponential complexity, unlike prior works on such problems, our greedy algorithms are simple to use and do not require solving any linear programs. Further, using the insight obtained from the optimal solution to a linear network, we propose two simple heuristics that can be implemented in polynomial time in a distributed fashion and compare them with the optimal solution. Simulations suggest that both heuristics perform very close to the optimal solution over random network topologies. © 2012 IEEE.},

A categorization of the types of contention over sensing resources is provided, as well as a taxonomy of available information for the sensor scheduling task. The Min-Conflict with Happiness (MCH) heuristic algorithm, which performs sensor scheduling for situations in which no information is known about future assignments, is then described. The primary contribution of this modification to Min-Conflict is that it permits the optimization of sensor certainty over the set of all active behaviors, thereby producing the best sensing state for the robot at any given time. Data are taken from simulation experiments and runs from a pair of Nomad200 robots using the SFX hybrid deliberative/reactive architecture. Results from these experiments demonstrate that MCH is able to satisfy more sensor assignments (up to 142%) and maintain a higher overall utility of sensing than greedy or random assignments (a 7-24% increase), even in the presence of sensor failures. In addition, MCH supports behavioral sensor fusion allocations. The practical advantages of MCH include fast, dynamic repair of broken schedules allowing it to be used on computationally constrained systems, compatibility with the dominant hybrid robot architectural style, and least-disturbance of prior assignments minimizing interruptions to reactive behaviors.},

	abstract = {In recent years, many developments in logistics were connected to the need for information in an efficient supply chain flow. The supply chain is often represented as a network called a supply chain network (SCN) that is comprised of nodes that represent facilities (suppliers, plants, distribution centers and customers). Arcs connect these nodes along with the production flow. A multistage SCN (MSCN) is a sequence of multiple SCN stages. The flow can only be transferred between two consecutive stages. The MSCN problem involves the choice of facilities (plants and distribution centers) to be opened and the distribution network design must satisfy the demand with minimum cost. In this paper, a revised mathematical model is first proposed to correct the fatal error appearing in the existing models. An efficient hybrid heuristic algorithm (HHA) was developed by combining a greedy method (GM), the linear programming technique (LP) and three local search methods (LSMs) (always used in solving the scheduling problem). The pair-wise exchange procedure (XP), the insert procedure (IP) and the remove procedure (RP) to solve the MSCN problem. Preliminary computational experiments demonstrate the efficiency and performance of the proposed HHA. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2004.},

Such monitoring results in a large number of periodic queries, which can significantly increase the load on a server that hosts information services. If the execution of these queries is not carefully scheduled on the server, high peak load might occur, leading to degraded service quality. We investigate this query scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing the server's peak load. We state an optimization-based formulation and show that this problem is NP-hard in the strong sense.

	abstract = {Scheduling arriving aircraft in terminal airspace can be formulated using mixed-integer linear programming and solved by a branch and bound algorithm. Given that the problem is intrinsically nondeterministic polynomial-time hard, success in solving the problem within a reasonable time is not always guaranteed. This paper proposes an efficient optimization approach that calculates the minimum total delay necessary for a conflict-free arrival sequence. Agreedy heuristic is developed to find a feasible solution quickly, which serves as a "hot start" so that the branch and bound algorithm can prune as many search tree nodes as it can. Unnecessary searching is thus saved. The greedy heuristic also provides an estimated upper bound for the maximum delay that guarantees a feasible solution for the mixed-integer linear programming. In addition, it identifies a group of aircraft associated with high delays, which are suspended in the first stage of scheduling and sequenced in the second stage based on available time slots. This tactic decreases the computational difficulty. The proposed approach is validated using arriving traffic in 40 major United States airports. Compared to a standalone mixed-integer linear programming, the greedy-heuristic-aided mixedinteger linear programming yields suboptimal solutions in a more efficient manner, and the compromise of optimality is limited.

These rules may be imposed either by technological limitations of the transceiver, or by the operational mode of the network. This paper considers 24 distinct communication constraint sets (CCS) by comparing the average cardinality of a maximal schedule under each CCS using a greedy edge selection heuristic. The average cardinality as a function of the network size is studied via Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation results are useful for network and transceiver designers by identifying the sensitivity of scheduling performance to the CCS. In particular, the results illuminate that the performance gain obtainable by removing each constraint is highly dependent upon the overall CCS.},

The problem arises from a real application in the production chain of a kitchen furniture plant. In different stages of the plant, items are grouped according to different attributes. A setup is required in a stage when the new batch has a different level of attribute from the previous one. Two objectives are considered, i.e., minimizing the total number of setups and minimizing the maximum number of setups of the stages. The problem is to determine a sequence of batches in search for Pareto-optimal solutions with respect to the two objectives. Several metaheuristics, including genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, and iterated local search (ILS) have been proposed for the two-stage problem. In this paper, we develop a constructive heuristic, which combines a least flexibility first principle and a greedy search, for the two- and three-stage problems. Computational results show that the proposed heuristic performs significantly better than the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing. Although the proposed heuristic is inferior to the ILS, which employs two constructive initial solution heuristic, for the two-stage problem, it can be easily extended to the three-stage problem. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We study the weighted rate sum maximization in the case of non-perfect Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT). Some relevant downlink optimization problems, such as the stabilization of the transmission queues under random packet arrivals and the proportional fair scheduling for infinite backlogged systems, can be solved as special cases of the proposed problem. We restrict the transmitter strategy to be based on Gaussian coding and beamforming. Even under this simplifying condition, the problem at hand is non-convex and it does not appear to lend itself to a simple algorithmic solution. Therefore, we introduce some approximations that yield a definition of signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) commonly used in the classical array-processing/beamforming literature. For the simpler (but still non-convex) approximated problem, we propose a powerful heuristic solution based on greedy user selection and a gradient iteration that converges to a local maximum of the objective function. This method yields very competitive results with relatively low computational complexity. Extensive simulations show that, in the case of perfect CSIT, the proposed heuristic scheme performs very closely to the optimal (dirty-paper coding) strategy while, in the case of non-perfect CSIT, it significantly outperforms previously proposed suboptimal approaches, such as random beamforming and approximated zero-forcing with greedy user selection. © 2007 IEEE.},

The problem of minimizing total tardiness in single machine scheduling is a combinatorial problem. Hence, heuristic development for such problems is inevitable. In this paper, an attempt has been made to develop a simple heuristic, alternatively called greedy heuristic, to minimize the total tardiness in a single machine scheduling problem with n independent jobs, each having its processing time and due date. Further, its solution accuracy is compared with the optimal solution of a set of randomly generated problems using an ANOVA experiment. From the ANOVA experiment, it is observed that the solution of the simple heuristic proposed in this paper does not differ significantly from the optimal solution at a significance level of 0.05.},

	abstract = {Channel allocation schemes that have been used in cellular wireless ave limited applicability to Wireless LANs (WLANs) because of the small number of available channels and irregular cell geometries in WLAN environments. In this paper, we propose a dynamic, frame-based channel allocation architecture for WLANs. In this architecture, time is divided into a sequence of consecutive frames (in the order of milliseconds), and in each frame, only a non-interfering subset of access points (APs) is activated. Under broad traffic assumptions, we prove that the attainable system throughput can be optimized by scheduling APs and allocating channels in each frame such that a weighted sum of queue sizes at the activated APs is maximized. This optimality criterion for AP scheduling and channel allocation leads to a novel graph problem which is a variant of the well-known maximum independent set problem. We develop two heuristics for solving this problem. The first is a greedy heuristic that yields an approximation algorithm that has quadratic time complexity (in the number of APs) and, under certain conditions, yields a constant (6) factor approximation bound. The second heuristic is a graph decomposition heuristic. This heuristic, again under certain conditions, yields better approximation ratio, 1+ε, but has complexity that grows exponentially with 1/ε2 for arbitrarily small ε > 0. Using the ns2 simulator we conducted experiments to compare our frame-based approach to static channel allocation. Results of our simulation indicate that our approach is able to deliver system throughput improvements of more than 50%. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

This paper first presents an extension of the geometric approach for solving a two-job shop problem, when there is one flexible job and the second job is a job shop job. Based on this extension and the notion of the combined job, an integrated greedy heuristic that simultaneously deals with the assignment and the sequencing subproblems is developed to solve the general case with more than two jobs.

The process terminates when a given time limit has been reached or the upper bound matches a precomputed lower bound. The algorithm can also be applied to two-dimensional bin-packing problems by having a constant depth for all boxes and bins. Computational experiments are reported for two- and three-dimensional instances with up to 200 boxes, showing that the algorithm on average finds better solutions than do heuristics from the literature.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a mathematical model and a solution algorithm are developed for solving a robot acquisition and cell formation problem (RACFP). Our model considers purchasing a proper mix of robots and assigning all given workstations to purchased robots such that each robot cell satisfies its workstations' resource demands while minimizing the total system (acquisition) cost. Specifically, each robot has two capacity constraints - available work envelope and effective machine time. RACFP is formulated as a multi-type two-dimensional bin packing problem, a pure 0-1 integer program which is known to be NP-hard. In this paper, a very efficient (polynomial time bound) heuristic algorithm is developed and implemented. The algorithm consists of two major stages. The first stage employs an LP-based bounding procedure to produce a tight solution bound, whereas the second stage repetitively invokes a random search heuristic using a greedy evaluation function. The algorithm is tested by solving 450 randomly generated problems based on realistic parameter values. Computational results show that the heuristic algorithm has outperformed algorithms using general optimization techniques such as Simulated Annealing and Column Generation. All test problems are solved within an order of magnitude of 10 seconds, with a gap of less than 1% from the optimum. More importantly, over 70% of all solutions are optimal (334 out of 450). The algorithm can be easily modified for other applications such as file placement for a multi-device storage system and job scheduling for a multi-processing system.},

The problem is of interest in manufacturing because any increase in the efficiency of a heavily utilized machine translates directly into cost savings. However, finding good solutions to this NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem has challenged researchers for years in industry and academia. A novel methodology, Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP), is used in this paper to develop an efficient heuristic for the SMS problem. The empirical results of other researchers are used to validate the heuristic's performance. Previous exact approaches using dynamic programming (DP) with branch and bound provide optimal solutions to SMS instances with up to 20 jobs. A clever implementation of tabu search shows success for problems possessing up to 100 jobs. Our heuristic compares favorably to both the DP and tabu search methods with respect to the solution values obtained and the CPU times required. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

A six-factor experiment with 192 test problems is used to evaluate the heuristics. The factors in the experiment included the procedures, number of items, capacity tightness, degree of commonality, setup cost to carrying cost ratio, and setup time to run time ratio. For smaller problems the heuristics are compared with optimal solutions found with an exact branch-and-bound algorithm. For larger problems, the heuristics are compared with a lower bound. The results of the experiment show that the heuristics provide excellent solutions across all experimental factors.

	abstract = {Managing an industrial production facility requires carefully allocating limited resources, and gives rise to large, potentially complicated scheduling problems. In this paper we consider a specific instance of such a problem: planning efficient utilization of the facilities and technicians that maintain the United States nuclear stockpile. A detailed study of this problem yields a complicated mixed-integer programming (MIP) model with upward of hundreds of thousands of variables and even more constraints. Consistently and quickly solving such a model exactly is impossible using today's algorithms and computers, and, in addition to branch-and-bound, requires good heuristics and approximation algorithms. In an effort to design such algorithms, we study several different methods of generating good solutions given the solution to the LP relaxation. We design a suite of sample data and test the algorithms. The goals of this project were twofold. First, we wanted to develop a program that could efficiently and accurately help with the Pantex planning problem. Second, we wanted to experimentally test various ideas, designed originally for "cleaner" problems, in this more challenging context. In summary, we demonstrate the value of using a-points as a way to quickly and cheaply generate, from one solution of an LP relaxation, many feasible solutions to an integer program. In this particular environment, the use of α-points, combined with other heuristics, outperforms local search. We also see the value of finding combinatorially-structured subproblems as opposed to using simple gredy approaches. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.},

This result can also be extended to edge weighted graphs. The l2-minimality is achieved only if a diffusion algorithm is used as preprocessing and the real movement of load is performed in a second step. Thus, it is advisable to split the balancing process into the two steps of first determining a balancing flow and afterwards moving the load. We introduce the problem of scheduling a flow and present some first results on its complexity and the approximation quality of local greedy heuristics.},

	abstract = {The operation scheduling is an important subtask in the automatic synthesis of digital systems. Many greedy heuristics have been proposed for the operation scheduling. but they cannot find the globally best schedule. In this paper we present an algorithm to construct near optimal schedules. The algorithm combines characteristics of simulated annealing and neural networks. The neural network used in our scheduling algorithm is similar to that proposed by Hellstrom et al. However, while the problems or Refs. [11] and [12] have a single type of constraint, the problem considered in this paper has three types of constraints. As the result, the energy function of the proposed neural network is given by the weighted sum of three energy functions. To minimize the weighted sum of two or more energy functions, conventional methods try to find a good set of weights using a try and error method. Our algorithm takes a different approach than these methods. Results of the experiments show that the proposed algorithm can be used as an alternative heuristic for solving the operation scheduling problem. In addition, the proposed algorithm can exploit the inherent parallelism of the neural network.},

This problem is proved to be NP-complete by Garey et al. [8], As a result, we developed a two-phase procedure to provide a near-optimal solution to this problem. The two-phase procedure includes the following steps: First, a greedy heuristic is applied to the set of jobs, N, to generate a “good” initial sequence. According to this initial sequence, we run Garey’s local optimization algorithm to provide an initial schedule. Then, a pairwise switching algorithm is adopted to further reduce the total deviation of the schedule.

The success has been remarkable for the Symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The crucial part in the method is the cutting plane algorithm: the algorithm that looks for valid inequalities that cut off the current non-feasible linear program (LP) solution. In turn this part relies on a good knowledge of the corresponding polyhedron and our ability to design algorithms that can identify violated valid inequalities. This paper deals with the separation of the capacity constraints for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). Three algorithms are presented: a constructive algorithm, a randomized greedy algorithm and a very simple tabu search procedure. As far as we know this is the first time a metaheuristic is used in a separation procedure. The aim of this paper is to present this application. No advanced tabu technique is used. We report computational results with these heuristics on difficult instances taken from the literature as well as on some randomly generated instances. These algorithms were used in a Branch and Cut procedure that successfully solved to optimality large CVRP instances. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The problem of audit staff scheduling normally involves auditors with varying efficiencies, and several audit engagements with varying requirements and at different locations. The task of scheduling auditors to the audit tasks becomes more complicated if the scheduler has to accommodate the many real life considerations. The problem, regardless of its size or complexity, has been formulated as a (0-1) integer program. However, the large number of variables and constraints in such a formulation makes the use of exact optimization methods impractical. In this paper, we present a heuristic procedure based on tabu search (TS) and intelligent memory structures for solving this problem. The TS method starts with a feasible schedule generated by a greedy forward dispatching procedure, then through a series of intensification and diversification steps it improves on the initial schedule. The improvement in the value of the objective function is observed interactively. The search can be terminated as the improvement in the value of the objective function stabilizes. Application of the TS method to different audit scheduling problems has led to a consistent and significant improvement in the value of the cost minimization objective function. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The only complicating feature of the problem is that classes must be grouped together into sequences known as pipelines. An ideal schedule will have all classes in a pipeline scheduled in consecutive weeks. The objective is to eliminate the nonproductive time spent by sailors at C-Schools who are waiting for the next class in a pipeline. In this investigation an implicit enumeration procedure for this problem was developed. The key component of our algorithm is a specialized greedy algorithm which is used to obtain a good initial incumbent. Often this initial incumbent is either an optimal schedule or a near optimal schedule. In an empirical analysis with the only other competing software system, our greedy heuristic found equivalent or better solutions in substantially less computer time. This greedy heuristic was extended and modified for the A-School scheduling problem and was found to be superior to its only competitor. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

We propose it as a viable new approach to stochastic combinatorial optimization. The main characteristics of this model are positive feedback, distributed computation, and the use of a constructive greedy heuristic. Positive feedback accounts for rapid discovery of good solutions, distributed computation avoids premature convergence, and the greedy heuristic helps find acceptable solutions in the early stages of the search process. We apply the proposed methodology to the classical Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and report simulation results. We also discuss parameter selection and the early setups of the model, and compare it with tabu search and simulated annealing using TSP. To demonstrate the robustness of the approach, we show how the Ant System (AS) can be applied to other optimization problems like the asymmetric traveling salesman, the quadratic assignment and the job-shop scheduling. Finally we discuss the salient characteristics - global data structure revision, distributed communication and probabilistic transitions of the AS. © 1996 IEEE.},

The problem can be categorized into two types: horizontal scheduling and vertical scheduling. For the case of horizontal scheduling, we propose a bipartite-matching scheme for instruction scheduling. We prove that our greedy bipartite-matching scheme always gives the optimal switching activities of the instruction bus for given VLIW instruction scheduling policies. For the case of vertical scheduling, we prove that the problem is NP-hard, and we further propose a heuristic algorithm to solve the problem. Our experiment is performed on Alpha-based VLIW architectures and an ATOM simulator, and the compiler incorporated in our proposed schemes is implemented based on SUIF and MachSUIF. Experimental results of horizontal scheduling optimization show an average 13.30% reduction with four-way issue architecture and an average 20.15% reduction with eight-way issue architecture for transitional activities of the instruction bus as compared with conventional list scheduling for an extensive set of benchmarks. The additional reduction for transitional activities of the instruction bus from horizontal to vertical scheduling with window size four is around 4.57 to 10.42%, and the average is 7.66%.

	abstract = {In a dedicated, mixed-machine, heterogeneous computing (HC) system, an application program may be decomposed into subtasks, then each subtask assigned to the machine where it is best suited for execution. Data relocation is defined as selecting the sources for needed data items. It is assumed that multiple independent subtasks of an application program can be executed concurrently on different machines whenever possible. A theoretical stochastic model for HC is proposed, in which the computation times of subtasks and communication times for intermachine data transfers can be random variables. The optimization problem for finding the optimal matching, scheduling, and data relocation schemes to minimize the total execution time of an application program is defined based on this stochastic HC model. The global optimization criterion and search space for the above optimization problem are described. It is validated that a greedy algorithm-based approach can establish a local optimization criterion for developing data relocation heuristics. The validation is provided by a theoretical proof based on a set of common assumptions about the underlying HC system and application program.

	abstract = {The problem of developing good schedules for Navy C-Schools has been modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem. The only complicating feature of the problem is that classes must be grouped together into sequences known as pipelines. An ideal schedule will have all classes in a pipeline scheduled in consecutive weeks. The objective is to eliminate the nonproductive time spent by sailors at C-Schools who are waiting for the next class in a pipeline. In this investigation an implicit enumeration procedure for this problem was developed. The key component of our algorithm is a specialized greedy algorithm which is used to obtain a good initial incumbent. Often this initial incumbent is either an optimal schedule or a near optimal schedule. In an empirical analysis with the only other competing software system, our greedy heuristic found equivalent or better solutions in substantially less computer time. This greedy heuristic was extended and modified for the A-School scheduling problem and was found to be superior to its only competitor.},

	abstract = {We present a polynomial time algorithm for constructing a minimum completion time schedule of instructions from a basic block on RISC machines such as the Sun SPARC, the IBM 801, the Berkeley RISC machine, and the HP Precision Architecture. Our algorithm can be used as a heuristic for RISC processors with longer pipelines, for which there is no known optimal algorithm. Our algorithm can also handle time-critical instructions, which are instructions that have to be completed by a specific time. Time-critical instructions occur in some real-time computations, and can also be used to make shared resources such as registers quickly available for reuse. We also prove that in the absence of time-critical constraints, a greedy scheduling algorithm always produces a schedule for a target machine with multiple identical pipelines that has a length less than twice that of an optimal schedule. The behavior of the heuristic is of interest because, as we show, the instruction scheduling problem becomes NP-hard for arbitrary length pipelines, even when the basic block of code being input consists of only several independent streams of straightline code, and there are no time-critical constraints. Finally, we prove that the problem becomes NP-hard even for small pipelines, no time-critical constraints, and input of several independent streams of straightline code if either there is only a single register or if no two instructions are allowed to complete simultaneously because of some shared resource such as a bus. © 1993, ACM.

The model is also applicable to other production systems for manufacturing high precision products requiring careful matching of components. For a two-component case, we prove that a 'greedy' production sequencing rule is optimal. Based on this result, we then develop an effective greedy heuristic sequencing rule for more general cases.

	abstract = {The mean tardiness problem involves sequencing a set of jobs on a single processor so as to minimize the average tardiness. Tardiness is the difference between the completion time of a job and its due date if the job is late, and zero otherwise. Optimal algorithms such as branch and bound or dynamic programming are effective for small problems; consequently, a variety of heuristics have been proposed. Several research studies have shown that the Wilkerson-Irwin heuristic is attractive both in terms of computational time and deviation from optimality. An extremely simple construction heuristic is proposed that is based on recursively identifying the most promising job to sequence in the last open position. This heuristic is compared to the Wilkerson-Irwin procedure on classes of test problems that have been previously shown to be difficult to solve. Rigorous statistical analysis confirms that the new heuristic is significantly better than Wilkerson-Irwin and that it performs increasingly better as problem size increases. This procedure can be embedded in more complex hybrid procedures such as those investigated by Potts and Van Wassenhove in 1991, or within optimum-seeking approaches such as branch and bound. © 1994.},

	abstract = {In the high-level synthesis of ASICs or in the code generation for ASIPs, the presence of conditionals in the behavioral description represents an obstacle to exploit parallelism. Most existing methods use greedy choices in such a way that the search space is limited by the applied heuristics. For example, they might miss opportunities to optimize across basic block boundaries when treating conditional execution. We propose a constructive method which allows generalized code motions. Scheduling and code motion are encoded in the form of a unified resource-constrained optimization problem. In our approach many alternative solutions are constructed and explored by a search algorithm, while optimal solutions are kept in the search space. Our method can cope with issues like speculative execution and code duplication. Moreover, it can tackle constraints imposed by the advance choice of a controller, such as pipelined-control delay and limited branch capabilities. The underlying timing models support chaining and multicycling. As taking code motion into account may lead to a larger search space, a code-motion pruning technique is presented. This pruning is proven to keep optimal solutions in the search space for cost functions in terms of schedule lengths. General Terms: Design, Algorithms. © 2000 ACM.},

The algorithm was initially designed for solving very large scale SCP instances, involving up to 5,000 rows and 1,000,000 columns, arising from crew scheduling in the Italian Railway Company, Ferrovie dello Stato SpA. In 1994 Ferrovie dello Stato SpA, jointly with the Italian Operational Research Society, organized a competition, called FASTER, intended to promote the development of algorithms capable of producing good solutions for these instances, since the classical approaches meet with considerable difficulties in tackling them. The main characteristics of the algorithm we propose are (1) a dynamic pricing scheme for the variables, akin to that used for solving large-scale LPs, to be coupled with subgradient optimization and greedy algorithms, and (2) the systematic use of column fixing to obtain improved solutions. Moreover, we propose a number of improvements on the standard way of defining the step-size and the ascent direction within the subgradient optimization procedure, and the scores within the greedy algorithms. Finally, an effective refining procedure is proposed. Our code won the first prize in the FASTER competition, giving the best solution value for all the proposed instances. The algorithm was also tested on the test instances from the literature: in 92 out of the 94 instances in our test bed we found, within short computing time, the optimal (or the best known) solution. Moreover, among 18 instances for which the optimum is not known, in 6 cases our solution is better than any other solution found by previous techniques.},

Two forms of adaptive search are identified, which are referred to as local and global adaptation. In both cases, the calculation of the greedy function is modified by an amount which measures heuristically the quality of the partial solution that is obtained when a decision is made. One use of global adaptation is an approach which is referred to as a learning strategy since it involves an attempt to learn from previous mistakes by an appropriate updating of the greedy function from one run of the heuristic to the next. Such a learning strategy forms the main focus of this paper. Experimental results show that it is potentially a powerful heuristic device, since it greatly enhanced the effectiveness of those methods that had previously been applied to this problem; that is, a greedy randomized heuristic which also incorporated a look-ahead strategy and a version of the well-known savings method. It is suggested that learning strategies of the general type introduced in this paper have potential for application to other combinatorial optimisation problems. © 1998 Operational Research Society Ltd.

It is assumed that each job has a due date that must be met, and that preemptions are not allowed. The problem is formulated as a dynamic program (DP) and solved with a reaching algorithm that exploits a series of dominance properties and efficiently generated bounds. A major factor underlying the effectiveness of the approach is the use of a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) to construct high quality feasible solutions. These solutions serve as upper bounds on the optimum, and permit a predominant portion of the state space to be fathomed during the DP recursion. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, an experimental design involving over 240 randomly generated problems was followed. The test results indicate that problems with up to 30 jobs can be readily solved on a microcomputer in less than 12 minutes. This represents a significant improvement over previously reported results for both dynamic programming and mixed integer linear programming approaches. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

	abstract = {This paper presents two new heuristics for the flowshop scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times (SDSTs) and makespan minimization objective. The first is an extension of a procedure that has been very successful for the general flowshop scheduling problem. The other is a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) which is a technique that has achieved good results on a variety of combinatorial optimization problems. Both heuristics are compared to a previously proposed algorithm based on the traveling salesman problem (TSP). In addition, local search procedures are developed and adapted to each of the heuristics. A two-phase lower bounding scheme is presented as well. The first phase finds a lower bound based on the assignment relaxation for the asymmetric TSP. In phase two, attempts are made to improve the bound by inserting idle time. All procedures are compared for two different classes of randomly generated instances. In the first case where setup times are an order of magnitude smaller than the processing times, the new approaches prove superior to the TSP-based heuristic; for the case where both processing and setup times are identically distributed, the TSP-based heuristic outperforms the proposed procedures. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

We present eight greedy heuristics, embedded in a single-pass, forward algorithm that uses information from a relaxed optimization model to schedule activities. In contrast to our previous research, activities are released for scheduling when they are precedence feasible. The heuristics require the evaluation of the earliness costs and tardiness penalties for each activity that are provided by the relaxed optimization model. We compare the performance of these heuristics to that of heuristics selected from our earlier research that delay the consideration of an activity for scheduling until the activities' target time specified by the optimization model becomes current. The results of a series of experiments across 144 different experimental environments indicate that the early release heuristics provide superior NPV results in many project environments. © 1993.},

Incorporation of the look-ahead feature gave an improvement in performance that was at least as great as, and in addition to, that which had been obtained through use of the well-known ‘savings’ method. Based upon the experimental results, some guidelines are proposed for the application of the heuristic to other problems.

To deliver video programmes to users' homes at attractive costs, we present intelligent caching strategies that judiciously store media information at strategic locations in the network. For information caching in a metropolitan area network, we devise a simple, yet effective caching strategy that uses a Greedy heuristic to determine when, where and for how long programs must be cached, so as to minimize the cumulative storage and network costs borne by users. Preliminary simulations demonstrate that the Greedy caching strategy performs exceptionally, in most cases providing near-optimal solutions. © 1995.},

Thus, instruction reordering to minimize data cache misses is an important consideration for optimizing compilers. In this paper, we prove that the problem of instruction reordering for data cache miss minimization belongs to the class of NP-complete problems. The framework that we develop for the proof exposes the symbiotic relationship among the references to the cache. This symbiosis exists because a single cache reference lengthens the life span of its neighbors in the cache, and thus provides opportunity for additional cache hits through reference to the neighbors. We present a greedy heuristic designed to exploit this symbiotic relationship to improve data cache performance for general-purpose programs. Experiments with a prototype implementation of the heuristic show that we can improve data cache performance in many cases. © Elsevier Science Inc. 1997.},

	abstract = {Machine scheduling has been a popular area of research during the past four decades. Its object is to determine the sequence for processing jobs on a given set of machines. The need for scheduling arises from the limited resources available to the decision-maker. In this study, a special situation involving a computationally difficult n/2/Flowshop/αF + βCmax flowshop scheduling problem is discussed. We develop a memetic algorithm (MA, a hybrid genetic algorithm) by combining a genetic algorithm and the greedy heuristic using the pairwise exchange method and the insert method, to solve the n/2/Flowshop/αF + βCmax flowshop scheduling problem. Preliminary computational experiments demonstrate the efficiency and performance of the proposed memetic algorithm. Our results compare favourably with the best-known branch-and-bound algorithm, the traditional genetic algorithm and the best-known heuristic algorithm.},
