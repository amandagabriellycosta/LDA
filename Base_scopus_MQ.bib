	abstract = {As offline control photovoltaic (PV) plants are not equipped with online communication and remote control systems, they cannot adjust their power in real-time. Therefore, in a distribution network saturated with offline control PVs, the distribution system operator (DSO) should schedule the distributed energy resources (DERs) considering the uncertainty of renewable energy to prevent curtailment due to overvoltage. This paper presents a day-ahead network operation strategy using a mobile energy storage system (MESS) and offline control PVs to minimize power curtailment. The MESS model efficiently considers the transportation time and power loss of the MESS, and models various operating modes, such as the charging, discharging, idle, and moving modes. The optimization problem is formulated based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) considering the spatial and temporal operation constraints of MESSs and is performed using chanced constrained optimal power flow (CC-OPF). The upper limits for offline control PVs are set based on the probabilistic approach, thus mitigating overvoltage due to forecasting errors. The proposed operation strategy was tested in the IEEE 33-node distribution system coupled with a 15-node transportation system. The test results show the effectiveness of the proposed method for minimizing curtailment in offline control PVs. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the maximum length car sequencing problem to support the assembly operations of a multinational automotive company. We propose an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to schedule the maximum number of cars without violating the so-called option constraints. In addition, we present valid combinatorial lower and upper bounds, which can be calculated in less than 0.01 s, as well as binary and iterative search algorithms to solve the problem when good primal bounds are not readily available. To quickly obtain high-quality solutions, we devise an effective iterated local search algorithm, and we use the heuristic solutions as warm start to further enhance the performance of the exact methods. Computational results demonstrate that relatively low gaps were achieved for benchmark instances within a time limit of ten minutes. We also conducted an instance space analysis to identify the features that make the problem more difficult to solve. Moreover, the instances reflecting the company's needs could be solved to optimality in less than a second. Finally, simulations with real-world demands, divided into shifts, were conducted over a period of four months. In this case, we use the proposed ILP model in all shifts except the last one of each month, for which we employ an alternative ILP model to sequence the unscheduled cars, adjusting the pace of the assembly line in an optimal fashion. The results pointed out that the latter was necessary in only one of the months. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

The goal is to produce a AGV transportation solution that minimizes the total cost, including travel cost, time cost, and AGV cost. Therefore, a mixed integer linear programming model is established. To improve the transportation efficiency, a dynamic calculation method is developed. In the DABC algorithm, a heuristic algorithm and a median based probability selection method are used. For improving the quality of the solutions, four effective neighborhood operators are introduced. In the local search, a rule is given to save the operation time and a problem-based search operator is proposed to improve the quality of the best individual. Finally, a series of comparison experiments were implemented with the iterative greedy algorithm, artificial bee colony algorithm, hybrid fruit fly optimization algorithm, discrete artificial bee colony algorithm, improved harmony search, and hybrid genetic-sweep algorithm. The results show that the proposed DABC algorithm has high performance on solving the delivery and pickup problem. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Problem statement: Nowadays, devices generate copious quantities of high-speed data streams due to Internet of Things (IoT) applications. For the most part, cloud computing platforms handle and manage all of these data and requests. However, for certain applications, the data transmission delay that comes with transferring data from edge devices to the cloud could be unbearable. When there are a lot of devices connected to the internet, the public network actually becomes a bottleneck for data transfer. In this setting, power management, data storage, resource management, and service management all necessitate more robust infrastructure and complex processes. More efficient use of network and cloud resources is achievable with fog computing's “intelligent gateway” capability. Methodology: Planning and managing resources is one of the most important factors affecting system performance (especially latency) in a fog-cloud environment. Planning in an environment with fog and clouds is an NP-hard problem. This paper delves into the optimisation difficulty of longevity for data-intensive job scheduling in fog and cloud-based IoT systems. The issue is initially expressed as an optimisation model for integer linear programming (ILP). Next, we provide a heuristic algorithm known as DLJSF (Data-Locality Aware Job Scheduling in Fog-Cloud) that is based on the suggested formulation. Results: The results of the tests showed that the performance of the proposed algorithm is close to the results by an average of 87 %. Also, on average, it is 99.16 % better than the LP results obtained from the optimal solution obtained from the solver obtained from the solution that the data is processed locally. To check the efficiency of the simulation solution, it was repeated for tasks with different entry rates and data with different sizes. Conclusion: According to the obtained documents, the data transfer approach can be valuable and the proposed algorithm has not lost its performance in different conditions. © 2024 The Authors},

The solution decomposes the NP-complete UCTP into two sub-problems, allowing a structured approach to addressing the complexities inherent in the UCTP process. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed to integrate academic year course schedule planning and instructor assignment, accommodating various constraints to meet student demands. The model optimizes the number of course sections and strategically schedules instructors, aiming to reduce the number of new and distinct courses assigned to them. Historical data from an academic department encompassing multiple disciplines, including Computer Information Systems, Business Management, and Business Analytics, at a large public university in the U.S. is used to develop the model, and the results are compared with the actual course schedule and instructor assignment. The results demonstrate that the proposed DSS would result in a 14 % reduction in the number of course sections offered, translating to approximately $130,000 in annual savings. Additionally, it could significantly reduce the number of new courses assigned to instructors by up to 81 % and the number of distinct course sections assigned to them by 29 %. © 2024},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel activity-based demand model that combines an optimisation framework for continuous temporal scheduling decisions (i.e. activity timings and durations) with traditional discrete choice models for non-temporal choice dimensions (i.e. activity participation, number and type of tours, and destinations). The central idea of our approach is that individuals resolve temporal scheduling conflicts that arise from overlapping activities, e.g. needing to work and desiring to shop at the same time, in order to maximise their daily utility. Flexibility parameters capture behavioural preferences that penalise deviations from desired timings. This framework has three advantages over existing activity-based modelling approaches: (i) the time conflicts between different temporal scheduling decisions including the activity sequence are treated jointly; (ii) flexibility parameters follow a utility maximisation approach; and (iii) the framework can be used to estimate and simulate a city-scale case study in reasonable time. We introduce an estimation routine that allows flexibility parameters to be estimated using real-world observations as well as a simulation routine to efficiently resolve temporal conflicts using an optimisation model. The framework is applied to the full-time workers of a synthetic population for the city of Lausanne, Switzerland. We validate the model results against reported schedules. The results demonstrate the capabilities of our approach to reproduce empirical observations in a real-world case study. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel decomposition method for two-stage stochastic mixed-integer optimization problems. The algorithm builds upon the idea of similarity between finite sample sets to measure how similar the first-stage decisions are among the uncertainty realization scenarios. Using such a Similarity Index, the non-anticipative constraints are removed from the problem formulation so that the original problem becomes block-separable on a scenario basis. Then, a term for maximizing the Similarity Index is included in all the sub-problems objective functions. Such sub-problems are solved iteratively in parallel so that their solutions are used to update the weighting parameter for maximizing the Similarity Index. The algorithm obtains a feasible solution when full similarity among scenario first stages is reached, that is, when the incumbent solution is non-anticipative. The proposal is tested in four instances of different sizes of an industrial-like scheduling problem. Comparison results show that the Similarity Index Decomposition provides significant speed-ups compared with the monolithic problem formulation, and provides simpler tuning and improved convergence over the Progressive Hedging Algorithm. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The rapid growth in the number of electric vehicles (EVs), driven by the ‘double-carbon’ target, and the impact of uncontrolled charging and discharging behaviour and discharged battery losses severely limit electric vehicles’ low carbon characteristics. Existing research on systemic low-carbon emissions and electric vehicle charging and discharging issues is usually determined by considering only carbon trading markets or charging and discharging management on the source side. In this regard, a coordinated and optimized operation model that considers the participation of electric vehicle clusters in deep peaking and the source network load and storage adjustable resources is proposed. The upper layer establishes a real-time price-based demand response mechanism for the load side with the minimum net load fluctuation as the objective function; the middle layer establishes a comprehensive operation mechanism for the source and storage side that includes an orderly charging and discharging peaking compensation mechanism for electric vehicles, and a deep peaking mechanism that takes into account clean emission, and constructs an optimal operation model with the minimum comprehensive operating cost as the objective function; the lower layer establishes a distribution network loss minimization model for the network side that takes into account the orderly charging and discharging of electric vehicle as the objective function. The optimal load model with the objective function of minimizing the distribution network loss is established at the lower level. Finally, the original problem is transformed into a mixed integer linear programming problem, and the model's effectiveness is verified by setting different scenarios. The model reduces the total cost by 22.22%, improves the wind power consumption rate by 19.55%, reduces the actual carbon emission by 16.66%, and reduces the distribution network loss by 13.91% compared to the basic model. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {Answer-set programming (ASP) is a prominent approach to declarative problem solving that is increasingly used to tackle challenging optimisation problems. We present an approach to leverage ASP optimisation by using large-neighbourhood search (LNS), which is a meta-heuristic where parts of a solution are iteratively destroyed and reconstructed in an attempt to improve an overall objective. In our LNS framework, neighbourhoods can be specified either declaratively as part of the ASP encoding or automatically generated by code. Furthermore, our framework is self-adaptive, i.e., it also incorporates portfolios for the LNS operators along with selection strategies to adjust search parameters on the fly. The implementation of our framework, the system ALASPO, currently supports the ASP solver clingo, as well as its extensions clingo-dl and clingcon that allow for difference and full integer constraints, respectively. It utilises multi-shot solving to efficiently realise the LNS loop and in this way avoids program regrounding. We describe our LNS framework for ASP as well as its implementation, discuss methodological aspects, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive LNS approach for ASP on different optimisation benchmarks, some of which are notoriously difficult, as well as real-world applications for shift planning, configuration of railway-safety systems, parallel machine scheduling, and test laboratory scheduling. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Motivated by the need for a green and low-carbon economy, we explore the co-scheduling optimization of berths and cranes. Our aim is to balance the carbon tax and operating costs of ports under uncertain conditions, proposing an innovative nonlinear mixed-integer programming formulation. To address this optimization challenge, we have developed an enhanced version of the adaptive spiral flying dung beetle algorithm (ASFDBO). In order to evaluate the performance of the ASFDBO algorithm, we performed a benchmark function test and a convergence analysis with other recognized metaheuristics. In addition, we verified the practical applicability of the ASFDBO algorithm in different test scenarios. Through numerical experiments, we analyze the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm’s scheduling solutions and improvement strategies. Results indicate that our collaborative scheduling optimization, which considers both carbon and production costs, achieves feasible solutions and reduces carbon expenses. Finally, we investigate the impact of different carbon tax rates on the joint scheduling optimization of berths and quay cranes, and the results show that a reasonable carbon tax policy can effectively reduce the carbon emissions of ports. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Grid-scale energy storage is becoming an essential element to effectively support the rapid increased use of renewable energy sources in the power network. The present work proposes a long-term techno-economic profitability analysis considering the net profit stream of a grid-level battery energy storage system (BESS) performing energy arbitrage as a grid service. The net profit is a cost function that includes the revenue derived by arbitrage, the import cost and the degradation cost induced by battery capacity fade. Three optimization techniques with a computationally efficient optimization logic are developed. The scenario with no-degradation is formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem, while the scenarios with and without degradation are formulated as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), and as mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problems. The non-linearity is introduced by implementing a BESS dynamic charge/discharge efficiency that is a function of the BESS power rate. Based on the obtained BESS optimal scheduling, a long-term profitability analysis is developed during the whole BESS lifetime. In the proposed case study, historical electricity market prices from the CAISO electricity market in the United States, California, are used as input. We found that, even without degradation, the break-even investment cost that makes the BESS profitable with a power to-energy-ratio of 1 MW/2MWh is 210 $/kWh. By implementing a cycle-counting degradation model, we observed a remarkable battery degradation on BESS profitability corresponding to a yearly net profit reduction in the 13–24 % range. From a long-term application perspective, the BESS calendar lifetime could be extended by reducing the battery cycling. Such cycling reduction is obtained by adding a penalty cost in the objective function of the energy arbitrage optimization problem. © 2024 The Authors},

Researching the multi-objective optimization scheduling of cascade hydropower stations under various spatiotemporal inflow impacts is of significant importance. Previous studies have typically only focused on the economic dispatch issues of cascade hydropower stations, with little attention given to their coupling mechanism models and the uncertainty impacts of inflows. Firstly, this paper establishes a coupled optimization scheduling model for cascade hydropower stations and elaborates on the operational mechanism of cascade hydropower stations. Secondly, according to the needs of actual scenarios, two types of optimization objectives are set, considering both the supply adequacy and peak-shaving capacity as indicators, with the total residual load and the peak-valley difference of the residual load as comprehensive optimization objectives. Subsequently, considering the uncertainty impact of the inflow side, a stochastic optimization model for inflow is established based on a normal distribution probability. Finally, case study analyses demonstrate that the proposed model not only effectively achieves supply stability but also reduces the peak-valley difference in load, and can achieve optimized scheduling under the uncertain environment of inflow. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The virtual power plants are aggregations of distributed generators, grid-connected devices in user side. The operation of virtual power plants affects the economic benefits and environmental benefits. However, due to the stochastic and fluctuating nature of power generation from renewable energy sources, the optimal scheduling problem for the virtual power plant containing high-dimensional random variables is difficult to solve. The conic power flow constraints are considered in the virtual power plant day-ahead optimal scheduling models to maximize the revenue by virtue of optimizing the flexible resources such as energy storage system and interruptible load. To quantify the uncertainties in the optimization problem, this paper proposes a network state-based power scenario reduction strategy for renewable energy generation, where typical scenarios are selected by the state of the grid voltage. The proposed day-ahead scheduling model is a mixed-integer, nonlinear, large-scale, stochastic optimization problem with high dimensional random variables, which is difficult to be solved directly by traditional centralized method. By temporally decoupling the charging and discharging model of energy storage systems, a distributed optimization algorithm is proposed based on multi-temporal power flow decoupling optimization model. The simulation results show that the proposed distributed optimization algorithm has high accuracy and good convergence, the virtual power plant can achieve day-ahead optimal scheduling and effectively promote renewable energy accommodation under the security and reliability of the grid. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {With the commercial deployment of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, the future integrated 6G-satellite system represents an excellent solution for ubiquitous connectivity and high-throughput data service to massive users. Due to the heterogeneity of users' traffic profiles, uneven traffic distribution among beams or users often occurs in LEO satellite systems. Conventional satellite payloads with fixed beam radiation patterns may result in large gaps between requested and allocated capacity. The advances of flexible satellite payloads with dynamic beamforming capabilities enable spot beams to adjust their coverage and adaptively schedule users, thus offering spatial-temporal domain flexibility. Motivated by this, as an early attempt, we investigate how adaptive beam patterns with flexible user scheduling schemes can help alleviate mismatches of requested-transmitted data in uneven-traffic and full-frequency reuse LEO systems. We formulate an optimization problem to jointly determine beam patterns, power allocation, user-LEO association, and user-slot scheduling. The problem is identified as mixed-integer nonconvex programming. We propose an efficient iterative algorithm to solve the problem by first determining beam patterns and user associations at the frame scale, followed by optimizing power allocation and user scheduling at the timeslot scale. The four-decision components are iteratively updated to improve the overall performance. Numerical results demonstrate the benefits brought by adaptive beam patterns and their effectiveness in reducing the mismatch effect in uneven-traffic LEO systems.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.},

In this work, we study the impact of jointly locating charging facilities, assigning electric buses to trips, and determining when and where to charge the buses. We propose a mixed integer linear program that co-optimizes planning and operational decisions jointly and an iterated local search heuristic to solve large-scale instances. Herein, we use a concurrent scheduler algorithm to generate an initial feasible solution, which serves as a starting point for our iterated local search algorithm. In the sequential case, we first optimize trip assignments and charging locations. Charging schedules are then determined after fixing the optimal decisions from the first level. The joint model, on the other hand, integrates charge scheduling within the local search procedure. The solution quality of the joint and sequential iterated local search models are compared for multiple real-world bus transit networks. Our results demonstrate that joint models can help further improve operating costs by 14.1% and lower total costs by about 4.1% on average compared with sequential models. In addition, energy consumption costs and contracted power capacity costs have been reduced significantly due to our integrated planning approach. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Integrating emerging shared mobility with traditional fixed-line public transport is a promising solution to the mismatch between supply and demand in urban transportation systems. The advent of modular vehicles (MVs) provides opportunities for more flexible and seamless intermodal transit. The MVs, which have been implemented, are comprised of automated modular units (MUs), and can dynamically change the number of MUs comprising them at different times and stops. However, this innovative intermodal urban transit brings with it a new level of dynamism and uncertainty. In this paper, we study the problem of jointly optimizing the timetable and the vehicle schedule within an intermodal urban transit network utilizing MVs within the context of distributionally robust optimization (DRO), which allows MVs to dynamically (de)couple at each stop and permits flexible circulations of MUs across different transportation modes. We propose a DRO formulation to explore the trade-off between operators and passengers, with the objective of minimizing the worst-case expectation of the weighted sum of passengers’ and operating costs. Furthermore, to address the computational intractability of the proposed DRO model, we design a discrepancy-based ambiguity set to reformulate it into a mixed-integer linear programming model. In order to obtain high-quality solutionss of realistic instances, we develop a customized decomposition-based algorithm. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The computational results of real-world case studies based on the operational data of Beijing Bus Line illustrate that the proposed integrated timetabling and vehicle scheduling method reduces the expected value of passengers’ and operating costs by about 6% in comparison with the practical timetable and fixed-capacity vehicles typically used in the Beijing bus system. © 2024},

EV scheduling has the potential to become a business that utilizes vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology to mitigate system impacts while providing financial incentives to customers. Efficient EV scheduling is a multi-objective optimization problem that simultaneously considers network and customer perspectives for co-optimization. This study introduces a hierarchical EV charging management platform (EVMP) with day-ahead and real-time stages that satisfy customer preferences while ensuring efficient system operation. In this process, in order to solve the computational issues of the optimal power flow (OPF) problem, including integer variables, the computational burden was alleviated by removing integer variables from the OPF problem of the day-ahead stage, and EV dynamics were effectively handled using the rolling-horizon framework in the real-time stage. This study focuses on the relationships between the objective functions at each stage and utilizes the augmented ɛ-constraint method (AUGMECON) to obtain a Pareto front that assists in stakeholder decision making. The Pareto front is constructed by considering stakeholders from both two- and three-way perspectives, allowing the system operator to select a solution from the Pareto front for decision making. © 2024 The Author(s)},

Home health care provides various services for disabled or elderly individuals at their homes. Also, dealing with the current critical situation of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to the limited capacity of hospitals and the feeling of insecurity in crowded places, home health care is more recommended. This paper addresses a Home Health Care Routing and Scheduling Problem (HHCRSP) with two modes of transportations including public and private modes. Also, multi-depot version of the problem is studied to enhance the service delivery in scattered points. In this study, a mathematical model is presented based on a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) whose objective function is minimization of the sum of the travel distance and overtime costs. Furthermore, three meta-heuristic algorithms including Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO), Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), and Simulated Annealing (SA) are presented for solving large-sized problems. Since the performance of meta-heuristic algorithms depends on setting the parameters, the Taguchi method is used to statistically set parameters of the developed algorithms.

	abstract = {Hybrid power plants have recently emerged as reliable and flexible electricity generation stations by combining multiple renewable energy sources, energy storage systems (ESS), and fossil-based output. However, the effective operation of the hybrid power plants to ensure continuous energy dispatch under challenging conditions is a complex task. This paper proposes a dispatch engine (DE) based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for the planning and management of hybrid power plants. To maintain the committed electricity output, the dispatch engine will provide schedules for operation over extended time periods as well as monitor and reschedule the operation in real time. Through precise prediction of the load and the photovoltaic (PV) and wind power outputs, the proposed approach guarantees optimum scheduling. The precise predictions of the load, PV, and wind power levels are achieved by employing a predictor of the Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) type. With such a dispatch engine, the operational costs of the hybrid power plants and the use of diesel generators (DGs) are both minimized. A case study is carried out to assess the feasibility of the proposed dispatch engine. Real-time measurement data pertaining to load and the wind and PV power outputs are obtained from different locations in the Sultanate of Oman. The real-time data are utilized to predict the future levels of power output from PV and from the wind farm over the course of 24 h. The predicted power levels are then used in combination with a PV–Wind–DG–ESS–Grid hybrid plant to evaluate the performance of the proposed dispatch engine. The proposed approach is implemented and simulated using MATLAB. The results of the simulation reveal the proposed FFNN’s powerful forecasting abilities. In addition, the results demonstrate that adopting the proposed DE can minimize the use of DG units and reduce a plant’s running expenses. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Network slicing represents a substantial technological advance in 5G mobile network, greatly expanding the variety and manifoldness of network services to be supported. Additionally, 3GPP 5G New Radio (NR) has introduced novel features such as mixed numerology and mini-slots, which can be harnessed by network slicing to cater to the diverse requirements of 5G services. While however the co-existence of multiple network slices leads to a challenging resource allocation problem, these new features also severely complicate the management of radio resources. As a further point of attention, the virtualization of radio functions may exact a significant toll from the, already limited, computing resources at the network edge. It follows that a cost-efficient resource allocation across all the slices becomes crucial. In this paper, we address the above-mentioned issues by modeling a cost-efficient radio resource management in 5G NR featuring network slicing, named CERS, through a Mixed Integer Quadratically constrained Program (MIQCP). We maximize the profit of all slices simultaneously guaranteeing the target data rate and delay specified in the service level agreements (SLAs) fo the different traffic flows. To reduce the complexity of the MIQCP problem, we decompose it into two sub-problems, namely, the scheduling problem of enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) user equipments (UEs) on a time-slot basis and of Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (uRLLC) UEs on a mini-slot basis, while keeping the objective unchanged. To address the scheduling issue of eMBB UEs, we employ a heuristic technique, and, by leveraging the outcome of this heuristic, we derive an optimal solution for the problem of uRLLC UEs. The significance of the proposed approach over a baseline approach is evaluated through extensive numerical simulations in terms of the number of allocated uRLLC resource blocks (RBs) per mini-slot. We also assess our approach by measuring the impact of the uRLLC slice changes on the eMBB slice, and vice versa, including delay for uRLLC users and data rates for eMBB users. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {This paper considers the impact of setup time in production scheduling and proposes energy-aware distributed hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup time (EADHFSP-ST) that simultaneously optimizes the makespan and the energy consumption. We develop a mixed integer linear programming model to describe this problem and present a two-stage adaptive memetic algorithm (TAMA) with a surprisingly popular mechanism. First, a hybrid initialization strategy is designed based on the two optimization objectives to ensure the convergence and diversity of solutions. Second, multiple population co-evolutionary approaches are proposed for global search to escape from traditional cross-randomization and to balance exploration and exploitation. Third, considering that the memetic algorithm (MA) framework is less efficient due to the randomness in the selection of local search operators, TAMA is proposed to balance the local and global searches. The first stage accumulates more experience for updating the surprisingly popular algorithm (SPA) model to guide the second stage operator selection and ensures population convergence. The second stage gets rid of local optimization and designs an elite archive to ensure population diversity. Fourth, five problem-specific operators are designed, and non-critical path deceleration and right-shift strategies are designed for energy efficiency. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, multiple experiments are performed on a benchmark with 45 instances. The experimental results show that the proposed TAMA can solve the problem effectively.  © 2021 TUP.},

	abstract = {Autoscaling enables container cluster orchestrators to automatically adjust computational resources, such as containers and Virtual Machines (VMs), to handle fluctuating workloads effectively. This adaptation can involve modifying the amount of resources (horizontal scaling) or adjusting their computational capacity (vertical scaling). The motivation for our work stems from the limitations of previous autoscaling approaches, which are either partial (scaling containers or VMs, but not both) or excessively complex to be used in real systems. This complexity arises from their use of models with a large number of variables and the addressing of two simultaneous challenges: achieving the optimal deployment for a single scheduling window and managing the transition between successive scheduling windows. We propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to address the challenge of autoscaling containers and VMs jointly, both horizontally and vertically, to minimize deployment costs. This model is designed to be used with predictive autoscalers and be solved in a reasonable time, even for large clusters. To this end, improvements and reasonable simplifications with respect to previous models have been carried out to drastically reduce the size of the resource allocation problem. Furthermore, the proposed model provides an enhanced representation of system performance in comparison to previous approaches. A tool called Conlloovia has been developed to implement this model. To evaluate its performance, we have conducted a comprehensive assessment, comparing it with two heuristic allocators with different problem sizes. Our findings indicate that Conlloovia consistently demonstrates lower deployment costs in a significant number of cases. Conlloovia has also been evaluated with a real application, using synthetic and real workload traces, as well as different scheduling windows, with deployment costs approximately 20% lower than heuristic allocators. © 2024, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The computing power network (CPN) is a novel network technology that integrates computing power from the cloud, edge, and terminals using IP/optical cross-layer networks for distributed computing. CPNs can provide an effective solution for distributed model training (DMT). As a bandwidth optimization architecture based on data parallelism, ring all-reduce (RAR) is widely used in DMT. However, any node or link failure on the ring can interrupt or block the requests deployed on the ring. Meanwhile, due to the resource competition of batch RAR-based DMT requests, inappropriate scheduling strategies will also lead to low training efficiency or congestion. As far as we know, there is currently no research that considers the survivability of rings in scheduling strategies for RAR-based DMT. To fill this gap, we propose a scheduling scheme for RAR-based DMT requests in CPNs to optimize the allocation of computing and wavelength resources considering the time dimension while ensuring reliability. In practical scenarios, service providers may focus on different performance metrics. We formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) model and a RAR-based DMT deployment algorithm (RDDA) to solve this problem considering four optimization objectives under the premise of the minimum blocking rate: minimum computing resource consumption, minimum wavelength resource consumption, minimum training time, and maximum reliability. Simulation results demonstrate that our model satisfies the reliability requirements while achieving corresponding optimal performance for DMT requests under four optimization objectives.  © 2009-2012 Optica Publishing Group.},

	abstract = {The variety of available technology options for the operation of zero-emission bus systems gives rise to the problem of finding an optimal technology decision for bus operators. Among others, overnight charging, opportunity charging and hydrogen-based technology options are frequently pursued technological solutions. As their operating conditions are strongly influenced by the urban context, an optimal technology decision is far from trivial. In this paper, we propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based optimization model that is built upon a broad input database, which allows a customized adaption to local circumstances. The ultimate goal is to determine an optimal technology decision for each bus line, considering its combined effects on charging and vehicle scheduling as well as infrastructural design. To this end, we develop technology-specific network representations for five distinct technologies. These networks can be viewed individually or as a multi-layered graph, which represents the input for the optimal technology mix. The proposed optimization framework is applied to a real-world instance with more than 4.000 timetabled trips. To study the sensitivity of solutions, parameter changes are tested in a comprehensive scenario design. The subsequent analysis produces valuable managerial insights for the bus operator and highlights the decisive role of certain planning assumptions. The results of our computations reveal that the deployment of a mixed fleet can indeed lead to financial benefits. The comparison of single technology system solutions provides a further basis for decision making and demonstrates relative superiorities between different technologies. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Space exploration plans are becoming increasingly complex as public agencies and private companies target deep-space locations, such as cislunar space and beyond, which require long-duration missions and many supporting systems and payloads. Optimizing multimission exploration campaigns is challenging due to the large number of required launches as well as their sequencing and compatibility requirements, making conventional space logistics formulations unscalable. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes an alternative approach that leverages a two-level hierarchical optimization algorithm: an evolutionary algorithm is used to explore the campaign scheduling solution space, and each of the solutions is then evaluated using a time-expanded multicommodity flow mixed-integer linear program. A number of case studies, focusing on the Artemis lunar exploration program, demonstrate how the method can be used to analyze potential campaign architectures. The method enables a potential mission planner to study the sensitivity of a campaign to program-level parameters such as logistics vehicle availability and performance, payload launch windows, and in situ resource utilization infrastructure efficiency. © 2024 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

	abstract = {Optimization-based scheduling in the chemical industry is highly beneficial but also highly difficult due to its combinatorial complexity. Different modeling and optimization techniques exist, each with individual strengths. We propose Benders decomposition to integrate mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and discrete-event simulation (DES) to solve flow shop scheduling problems with makespan minimization objective. The basic idea is to generate valid Benders cuts based on sensitivity information of the DES sub problem, which can be found in the critical paths of DES solutions. For scaled literature flow shops, our approach requires at least an order of magnitude fewer iterations than a genetic algorithm and provides optimality gap information. For a real-world case study, our approach finds good solutions very quickly, making it a powerful alternative to established methods. We conclude that the Benders-DES algorithm is a promising approach to combine rigorous MILP optimization capabilities with high-fidelity DES modeling capabilities. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The dynamic scheduling problem (DSP) in unreliable flexible manufacturing systems (UFMSs) with concurrency, conflicts, resource sharing, and sequential operations is a complex optimization problem that requires the use of efficient solution methodologies. The effectiveness of scheduling UFMSs relies on the quality of equipment maintenance. Currently, UFMSs with consistently large queues of parts awaiting service employ a repair-after-failure approach as a standard maintenance procedure. This method may require unexpected resources, incur costs, consume time, and potentially disrupt the operations of other UFMSs, either partially or fully. This study suggests using a predictive maintenance (PdM) strategy that utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT) to predict and avoid early mechanical equipment failures before they happen in UFMSs, thereby reducing unplanned downtime and enhancing reliability. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to construct timed Petri net (TPN) models using the IoT for the PdM configuration of mechanical equipment in the dynamic scheduling problem of UFMSs. This necessitates that users represent the specific problem using TPNs. The process of PN modeling requires the utilization of domain knowledge pertaining to the target problems as well as to machine information. However, it is important to note that the modeling rules for PNs are straightforward and limited in number. Consequently, the TPN model is applied to generate and formulate mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) instances accurately. This is done to identify the optimal production cycle time, which may be implemented in real-life scenarios. Several UFMS instances are used to demonstrate the applications and effectiveness of the proposed method. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed method shows superior solution quality, effectively solves instances for a total of 10 parts and 6 machines, and achieves a solution in a reasonable CPU time. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {To enhance fuel efficiency and lower manufacturing and maintenance costs, in-vehicle wireless networks can facilitate the weight reduction of vehicle wire harnesses. In this paper, we utilize the Impulse Radio-UltraWideband (IR-UWB) of IEEE 802.15.4a/z for in-vehicle wireless networks because of its excellent signal penetration and robustness in multipath environments. Since clear channel assessment is optional in this standard, we employ polling control as a multiple access control to prevent interference within the system. Therein, the preamble overhead is large in IR-UWB of IEEE 802.15.4a/z. Hence, aggregating as much sensor data as possible within each frame is more efficient. In this paper, we assume that reading out data from sensors and sending data to actuators is periodical and that their respective phases can be adjusted. Therefore, this paper proposes an integer linear programming-based scheduling algorithm that minimizes the number of transmitted frames by adjusting the read and write phases. Furthermore, we provide a heuristic algorithm that computes a suboptimal but acceptable solution in a shorter time. Experimental validation shows that the data aggregation of the proposed algorithms is robust against interference. © 2024 The Institute of Electronics.},

	abstract = {Future cities must play a vital role in reducing energy consumption and decarbonizing the electricity sector, thus evolving from passive structures towards more efficient smart cities. This transition can be facilitated by energy communities. This emerging paradigm consists of collectivizing a set of residential installations equipped with onsite renewable generators and storage assets (i.e., prosumers), which can eventually share resources to pursue collective welfare. This paper focuses on cooperative communities, where prosumers share resources without seeking selfish monetary counterparts. Despite their apparent advantages, energy management and scheduling of energy communities suppose a challenge for conventional tools due to the high level of uncertainty (especially due to intermittent renewable generation and random demand), and privacy concerns among prosumers. This paper addresses these issues. Specifically, a novel management structure based on multiple aggregators is proposed. This paradigm preserves users' confidential features while allowing them to extract the full potential of their assets. To efficiently manage the variety of assets available under uncertainty, an adaptive robust day-ahead scheduling model is developed, which casts as a solvable and portable Mixed Integer Linear Programming framework, which eases its implementation in real-world cases. The new proposal concerns uncertain generation and demand using a polyhedral representation of the uncertainty set. A case study is conducted to validate the developed model, showing promising results. Moreover, different results are obtained and analysed. Finally, it is worth remarking on how the level of robustness impacts the collective bill, incrementing it by 75 % when risk-averse conditions are assumed. In addition, the role of storage assets under pessimistic conditions is remarked, pointing out that these assets rule the scheduling plan of the community instead of renewable generators. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The overall electricity consumption of electrolytic aluminum and ferroalloy loads is significant, and some of these loads have dispatch potential that can be used to locally absorb wind power while reducing dependence on conventional thermal power. To characterize the uncertainty of wind power, a fuzzy set of wind power forecasting error probability distribution based on the Wasserstein distance was first established, and the approximate radius of the fuzzy set was corrected under extreme scenarios. By introducing joint chance constraints, the inequalities of uncertain variables were established at the lowest confidence level to improve the reliability of the model. Next, a two-stage distributed robust optimal scheduling model for source-load coordination was developed. In the first stage, wind power forecasting information was fully utilized to schedule the electrolytic aluminum load and optimize unit commitment. In the second stage, the uncertainty of wind power output was considered to schedule the ferroalloy load and optimize unit output. The model was approximately transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming problem and solved using a sequential algorithm. The IEEE 24-bus system was used for case validation. The validation results show that the model can effectively improve wind power absorption capacity, reduce overall operating costs, and achieve a balance between low carbon emissions and robustness. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {With the shortage of fossil energy and the increasingly serious environmental problems, renewable energy based on wind and solar power generation has been gradually developed. For the problem of wind power uncertainty and the low-carbon economic optimization problem of an integrated energy system with power to gas (P2G) and carbon capture and storage (CCS), this paper proposes an economic optimization scheduling strategy of an integrated energy system considering wind power uncertainty and P2G-CCS technology. Firstly, the mathematical model of the park integrated energy system with P2G-CCS technology is established. Secondly, to address the wind power uncertainty problem, Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is used to generate a large number of wind power scenarios, and the fast antecedent elimination technique is used to reduce the scenarios. Then, to establish a mixed integer linear programming model, the branch and bound algorithm is employed to develop an economic optimal scheduling model with the lowest operating cost of the system as the optimization objective, taking into account the ladder-type carbon trading mechanism, and the sensitivity of the scale parameters of P2G-CCS construction is analyzed. Finally, the scheduling scheme is introduced into a typical industrial park model for simulation. The simulation result shows that the consideration of the wind uncertainty problem can further reduce the system’s operating cost, and the introduction of P2G-CCS can effectively help the park’s integrated energy system to reduce carbon emissions and solve the problem of wind and solar power consumption. Moreover, it can more effectively reduce the system’s operating costs and improve the economic benefits of the park. © 2024 by the authors.},

For classified material relocation needs and constraints, we obtain the relationship between walking speed and load weight for a single person, as well as the time cost for different round trips. By establishing an integer programming model with the minimum total transportation time cost and shelf life as the objective function and the requirements of negative weight and speed as the constraint conditions, we reach the optimal item allocation methods considering time cost and shelf life. We discover that there is an approximate linear relationship between the change in natural walking speed and travel time when the load is small, thus obtaining the time cost of student transportation under different round-trip situations. The Monte Carlo simulation algorithm, which is more efficient compared with other methods such as the integer programming method, is used to obtain the optimal allocation scheme that meets the efficiency and quality requirements.

	abstract = {Planning maintenance of medium voltage overhead lines is one of the most important issues in the studies on power distribution network, which will prevent and reduce unwanted interruption. In this paper, long-term maintenance of medium voltage networks was planned by multi-objective function, including an extended mixed-integer linear model to optimize costs, energy not supplied (ENS), and average interruption duration index (SAIDI). In addition, the uncertainty about the annual growth rate of the load, the increase in the cost of goods and services and the increase in the selling price of energy as well as various constraints are all included in the desired objective function, which is one of the main innovations of this paper compared to other published studies. To apply the uncertainties, information gap decision theory (IGDT) has been used, and to solve the objective functions, LP-Metric method has been used. The proposed method was implemented on the standard 11-bus RBTS network by MATLAB and GAMS. The results showed that three different long-term maintenance plans proposed here lead to the optimization of the annual maintenance costs of network, reduction in ENS and interruption, and increase in the reliability of the network based on the uncertainty of each feeder. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {Operations Research practitioners often want to model complicated functions that are difficult to encode in their underlying optimisation framework. A common approach is to solve an approximate model, and then use a simulation to evaluate the true objective value of one or more solutions. We propose a new approach to integrating simulation into the optimisation model itself. The idea is to run the simulation at each incumbent solution to a master problem. The simulation results are then used to guide the trajectory of the optimisation model itself using logic-based Benders cuts. We test the approach on a class of stochastic resource allocation problems with monotonic performance measures. We derive strong novel Benders cuts that are provably valid for all problems of the given form. We consider two concrete examples: a nursing home shift scheduling problem, and an airport check in counter allocation problem. While previous papers on these applications could only approximately solve realistic instances, we are able to solve them exactly within a reasonable amount of time. Moreover, while those papers account for the inherent variance of the problem by including estimates of the underlying random variables as model parameters, we are able to compute sample-average approximations to optimality with up to 100 scenarios. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {As the Internet of Things(IoT) and its intelligent applications continue to proliferate, forthcoming 6G networks will confront the dual challenge of heightened communication and computing capacity demands. To address this, D2D collaborative computing is being explored. However, the current D2D collaborative computing ignores the integrity of computing and communication. For a single-task device, offloading operations intertwine computing and communication, internal coupling causes due to parallel executed between local and D2D offloading. In addition, external coupling arises among devices competing for limited radio and computing resources. Worse, internal coupling and external coupling interact, exacerbating the situation. To address these challenges, a novel D2D offloading framework is proposed based on hyper-graph matching in this paper. Our goal is to minimize both delay and energy costs while ensuring service quality for all users by jointly optimizing task scheduling, offload policies and resource allocation. The original problem is formulated as a nonlinear integer programming problem. Then, by three-stage strategy optimization decomposition, it is separated into several sub-problems. In the first stage, a polynomial-time algorithm has been developed to optimize the task offloading ratio, taking into account both its upper and lower bounds. In the second stage, a geometric programming algorithm has been created to address power allocation. In the third stage, a three-dimensional hyper-graph matching model is employed to derive the optimal offloading and channel allocation policies. This is based on analyzing the conflict graph and applying the claw theorem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms other algorithms by approximately 12%, 20%, 28%, 40%, respectively. Moreover, it enhances both spectral efficiency and computational efficiency. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {This article tackles the problem of optimal placement of complex real-time embedded applications on heterogeneous platforms. Applications are composed of directed acyclic graphs of tasks, with each directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) having a minimum inter-arrival period for its activation requests and an end-to-end deadline within which all of the computations need to terminate since each activation. The platforms of interest are heterogeneous power-aware multi-core platforms with Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) capabilities, including big.LITTLE Arm architectures and platforms with GPU or Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware accelerators with Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration capabilities. Tasks can be deployed on CPUs using partitioned Earliest Deadline First (EDF)-based scheduling. Additionally, some of the tasks may have an alternate implementation available for one of the accelerators on the target platform, which are assumed to serve requests in non-preemptive FIFO order. The system can be optimized by minimizing power consumption, respecting precise timing constraints, maximizing the applications’ slack, respecting given power consumption constraints, or even a combination of these, in a multi-objective formulation. We propose an off-line optimization of the mentioned problem based on mixed-integer quadratic constraint programming (MIQCP). The optimization provides the DVFS configuration of all the CPUs (or accelerators) capable of frequency switching and the placement to be followed by each task in the DAGs, including the software-vs.-hardware implementation choice for tasks that can be hardware accelerated. For relatively big problems, we developed heuristic solvers capable of providing suboptimal solutions in a significantly reduced time compared to the MIQCP strategy, thus widening the applicability of the proposed framework. We validate the approach by running a set of randomly generated DAGs on Linux under SCHED_DEADLINE, deployed onto two real boards, one with Arm big.LITTLE architecture, the other with FPGA acceleration, verifying that the experimental runs meet the theoretical expectations in terms of timing and power optimization goals. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {The operational phase of integrated energy systems (IESs), installed in distribution systems, is increasingly confronted with uncertainties in electrical consumption and output power of variable energy resource (VRE) (e.g., solar photovoltaics). One common approach to mitigate this challenge is to implement day-Ahead (DA) scheduling based on cleared prices and purchased power. While this method is effective to some extent, it may not always provide the level of accuracy required. Another viable option is the application of incentive-based demand-response program (I-DRP), where adjustments to energy usage are made in return for a fixed tariff. Nonetheless, this method could result in monopolistic decision-making within an expanding energy industry, albeit assisting in alleviating the barrier. The complexity doubles as the nonlinear formulation of economic objective function is considered in the optimization stage. Hence, the optimality of the solution is a matter of concern. To address these challenges, this research introduces a two-stage coordinated strategy (TSCS) that combines accurate short-Term forecasting of uncertainties and I-DRP with regulations of DA and real-Time markets to identify the best possible offers and improves the operational efficiency of the IES. By conducting simulations on the IEEE 85-bus test system and comparing the results of the proposed algorithm with those of stochastic programming with fixed reward and penalty rates, our study demonstrates the reliability and accuracy of TSCS, highlighting the flexibility of offers in terms of customer's participation in the optimal operation of the IES.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is the paradigm for delivering streaming content, office applications, software functions, computing power, storage, and more as services over the Internet. It offers elasticity and scalability to the service consumer and profit to the provider. The success of such a paradigm has resulted in a constant increase in the providers’ infrastructure, most notably data centers. Data centers are energy-intensive installations that require power for the operation of the hardware and networking devices and their cooling. To serve cloud computing needs, the data center organizes work as virtual machines placed on physical servers. The policy chosen for the placement of virtual machines over servers is critical for managing the data center resources, and the variability of workloads needs to be considered. Inefficient placement leads to resource waste, excessive power consumption, and increased communication costs. In the present work, we address the virtual machine placement problem and propose an Imitation-Based Optimization (IBO) method inspired by human imitation for dynamic placement. To understand the implications of the proposed approach, we present a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that, with the proposed IBO, the energy consumption decreases at an average of 7%, 10%, 11%, 28%, 17%, and 35% compared to Hybrid meta-heuristic, Extended particle swarm optimization, particle swarm optimization, Genetic Algorithm, Integer Linear Programming, and Hybrid Best-Fit, respectively.

	abstract = {Research has shown the effective use of storage technologies to support the operation of a network with a large share of renewable sources of energy. This is done by storing excess energy when generation exceeds demand and delivering the extra energy stored when demand exceeds generation. This ensures that renewable resources are used even when renewable generation is not sufficient to satisfy the demand. To maximise the benefit of storage units in the network, their size and location within the network need to be optimised to the characteristics of the network, the demand and generation profiles. The optimisation is done to minimise network congestion and losses while maximising the benefits of the storage elements in the network. Several optimisation processes have been employed to perform this task but consideration of the storage technology and storage utilisation were not sufficiently explored. The proposed method considered optimising the size and location of distributed energy storage resources in a radial distribution network taking into consideration the effect of storage technology. The results showed that the location and sizes of distributed energy storage depend not only on the aggregated size of the technology but also on the technology types. The results also show that the size of the aggregated storage influences the overall network losses. Generally, the larger the aggregated size of distributed storage, the more the storage units are distributed resulting in a greater reduction of network losses. Among the storage technologies considered, Lithium-Ion batteries presented the most improvement in network losses due to their higher-rated power delivery and charging capacity relative to the energy storage size. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Multi-energy synergy systems integrating high-penetration large-scale plug-in electric vehicles, distributed renewable energy generations, and battery energy storage systems have great potential to reduce the reliance of the grid on traditional fossil fuels. However, the random charging characteristics of plug-in electric vehicles and the uncertainty of photovoltaics may impose an additional burden on the grid and affect the supply–demand equilibrium. To address this issue, judicious scheduling optimization offers an effective solution. In this study, considering charge and discharge management of plug-in electric vehicles and intermittent photovoltaics, a novel Multi-energy synergy systems scheduling framework is developed for solving grid instability and unreliability issues. This formulates a large-scale mixed-integer problem, which calls for a powerful and effective optimizer. The new binary level-based learning optimization algorithm is proposed to address nonlinear large-scale high-coupling unit commitment problems. To investigate the feasibility of the proposed scheme, numerical experiments have been carried out considering multiple scales of unit numbers and various scenarios. Finally, the results confirm that the proposed scheduling framework is reasonable and effective in solving unit commitment problems, can achieve 3.3% cost reduction and demonstrates superior performance in handling large-scale energy optimization problems. The integration of plug-in electric vehicles, distributed renewable energy generations, and battery energy storage systems is verified to reduce the output power of 192.72 MW units during peak periods to improve grid stability. Therefore, optimizing energy utilization and distribution will become an indispensable part of future power systems. © 2024},

	abstract = {Ensuring application service availability is a critical aspect of delivering quality cloud computing services. However, placing virtual machines (VMs) on computing servers to provision these services can present significant challenges, particularly in terms of meeting the requirements of application service providers. In this paper, we present a framework that addresses the NP-hard dynamic VM placement problem in order to optimize application availability in cloud computing paradigm. The problem is modeled as an integer nonlinear programming (INLP) optimization with multiple objectives and constraints. The framework comprises three major modules that use optimization methods and algorithms to determine the most effective VM placement strategy in cases of application deployment, failure, and scaling. Our primary goals are to minimize power consumption, resource waste, and server failures while also ensuring that application availability requirements are met. We compare our proposed heuristic VM placement solution with three related algorithms from the literature and find that it outperforms them in several key areas. Our solution is able to admit more applications, reduce power consumption, and increase CPU and RAM utilization of the servers. Moreover, we use a deep learning method that has high accuracy and low error loss to predict application task failures, allowing for proactive protection actions to reduce service outage. Overall, our framework provides a comprehensive solution by optimizing dynamic VM placement. Therefore, the framework can improve the quality of cloud computing services and enhance the experience for users. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Consumers are increasingly seeking products with a higher degree of customization, and this has intensified the search for more flexible production systems. Unexpected phenomena, including those impacting the economy and public health, have shown the need for high reactivity by manufacturers. Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems are one of the means to respond to new market needs. They are designed to be able to quickly change their structure and thus adapt their functionalities and capabilities. A central question with regard to these types of systems is when and how they should be reconfigured. It is, however, a question that needs to be addressed simultaneously alongside the classic resource allocation and scheduling problems, since the problems are interdependent. This paper proposes four models that address the problem sequentially, partially sequentially, and integrally. Our numerical analysis demonstrates the advantage and importance of treating these problems in an integrated manner. In addition, we provide and compare three exact methods for the integrated process planning, layout, and scheduling optimization problems. The exact methods are integer linear programming, constraint programming, and constraint programming with search strategies, which our numerical examples show to be greatly superior to the two others. Finally, we present a problem at an industrial scale. © (2024), (University of Novi Sad). All rights reserved.},

This paper addresses the challenges of scheduling multiple types of equipment, such as dual trolley quay cranes (DTQCs), automated guided vehicles (AGVs), double cantilever rail cranes (DCRCs), and external trucks (ETs) in U-shaped ACTs. This paper proposes a mixed integer linear programming model for optimizing the multiple equipment scheduling, aiming to minimize container completion time and AGV waiting time simultaneously. This paper customizes a hybrid genetic-cuckoo optimization algorithm (HGCOA) with double-point crossover and Lévy flight Cuckoo search strategies. Extensive numerical results show that the proposed HGCOA outperforms the benchmark genetic algorithms in terms of solution quality and computational time while significantly improving efficiency without substantial sacrifices in solution quality compared with the exact solution method.

	abstract = {As transit authorities increasingly adopt electric buses (EBs) to mitigate air quality concerns and greenhouse gas emissions, new challenges arise in bus scheduling and timetabling. Unlike traditional buses, EBs face operational obstacles due to their shorter range and extended charging times. Existing mathematical optimization models for operation planning of traditional buses must be revised to address these unique characteristics of EBs. This study introduces a new approach to integrate timetabling and bus scheduling to enhance the level of service and minimize operational costs, using a case study of a University shuttle bus service in Montreal, Canada. The level of service will be enhanced by reducing students waiting time and improving their in-vehicle comfort through seat availability. The scheduling aspect seeks to reduce the total operational costs, which include travel, electricity consumption, and usage costs of EBs. The proposed algorithm calculates the waiting time and seat availability for different headway values and addresses the scheduling problem using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model with an arc-based approach, solved using the Cplex Optimization Studio software version 12.8. A normalized weighted sum technique is then applied to select the optimal headway, balancing waiting time, seat availability, and operational costs. The effectiveness of our approach was tested through a case study of Concordia University’s shuttle bus service. Comparative analysis of the current and proposed schedules shows that our approach significantly improves service quality by decreasing waiting times and increasing seat availability while optimizing cost-effectiveness compared to the existing timetable of the Concordia shuttle bus. The proposed approach ensures a smooth transition to a fully electric transit system for shuttle bus services. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {We tackle a capacitated lot-sizing and scheduling problem (CLSP) with the main objective of minimizing changeover time in the production of metal parts for car seats. Changeovers occur when a machine (or production line) is reconfigured to produce a different product or part, leading to production downtime and loss of efficiency. In this study, we first provide a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of the problem. We test the limits of solving the problem with commercial mathematical programming software. We also propose two approaches to tackle instances found in practice for which the mathematical programming model is not a viable solution method. Both approaches are based on partitioning the entire production of a part into production runs (or work slots). In the first approach, the work slots are assigned to machines and sequenced by a metaheuristic that follows the search principles of the GRASP (greedy randomized adaptive procedure) and VNS (variable neighborhood search) methodologies. In the second approach, we develop a Hexaly Optimizer (formerly known as LocalSolver) model to assign and sequence work slots. The study provides insights into how to minimize changeovers and improve production efficiency in metal parts manufacturing for car seats. The findings of this study have practical implications for the auto-part manufacturing industry, where efficient and cost-effective production is critical to meet the demands of the market. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {The allocation of resources and scheduling of tasks, specifically mapping, in multicore systems on-chip (MCSoC), poses significant challenges. Tasks have diverse resource requirements and interact with each other, while network-on-chip (NoC)-based MCSoC consists of heterogeneous cores and communication networks. The heterogeneity of resources in MCSoC, along with the varying computational and communication demands of applications, makes mapping a complex optimization problem. We have mathematically modeled the mapping problem in NoC-based MCSoC using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) with the objective of minimizing the execution time of applications. This model incorporates computation and communication capacity, energy budget constraints of MCSoC, and execution time requirements of applications. We further propose heuristics, including simulated annealing (SA) and genetic algorithm (GA), considering the capacity and budget constraints of MCSoC systems to accelerate applications and provide quick mapping solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance from SA and GA heuristics is very close (within 10%) to the optimal solutions from MILP across various applications for 2D-Mesh NoCs with 16–100 cores. The energy consumption of SA and GA heuristics is also very close to the optimal solutions from MILP, with a few exceptions on small-scale 16-core NoC. Additionally, SA outperforms GA in most cases for all applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {The timely transportation of goods to customers is an essential component of economic activities. However, heavy-duty diesel trucks used for goods delivery significantly contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within many large metropolitan areas, including Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. To reduce GHG emissions by facilitating freight electrification, this paper proposes Joint Routing and Charging (JRC) scheduling for electric trucks. The objective of the associated optimization problem is to minimize the cost of transportation, charging, and tardiness. A large number of possible combinations of road segments as well as a large number of combinations of charging decisions and charging durations leads to a combinatorial explosion in the possible decisions electric trucks can make. The resulting mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem is thus extremely challenging because of the combinatorial complexity even in the deterministic case. Therefore, a Surrogate Level-Based Lagrangian Relaxation (SLBLR) method is employed to decompose the overall problem into significantly less complex truck subproblems. In the coordination aspect, each truck subproblem is solved independently of other subproblems based on the values of Lagrangian multipliers. In addition to serving as a means of guiding and coordinating trucks, multipliers can also serve as a basis for transparent and explanatory decision-making by trucks. Testing results demonstrate that even small instances cannot be solved using the off-the-shelf solver CPLEX after several days of solving. The SLBLR method, on the other hand, can obtain near-optimal solutions within a few minutes for small cases, and within 30 min for large ones. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that as battery capacity increases, the total cost decreases significantly; moreover, as the charging power increases, the number of trucks required decreases as well. © 2024 The Author(s)},

At the same time, network slicing in 5G and beyond systems provides easier management of different categories of users and traffic, and a better basis for providing quality of service, especially for demanding use cases such as industrial control. In previous works, we have presented solutions for scheduling industrial control traffic in LIS and massive MIMO systems. We now consider the case of dynamic slicing in the radio access network, where we need to not only meet the stringent latency and reliability requirements of industrial control traffic, but also minimize the radio resources occupied by the network slice serving the control traffic, ensuring resources are available for lower-priority traffic slices. In this paper, we provide mixed-integer programming optimization formulations for radio resource usage minimization for dynamic network slicing. We tested our formulations in numerical experiments with varying traffic profiles and numbers of nodes, up to a maximum of 32 nodes. For all problem instances tested, we were able to calculate an optimal schedule within 1 s, making our approach feasible for use in real deployment scenarios. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has been growing quickly since the 5 G era arrived, which has boosted the quantity of data stream and computational demands. Ultra-dense Edge Computing (UDEC) is a result of the growing popularity of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Ultra-dense Network (UDN), two vital technologies with bright futures. Task offloading is viewed in the UDEC network as a successful strategy to offer mobile users low-latency and flexible computing capabilities. However, the edge cloud's constrained computing capacity and mobile users' dynamically shifting computing requirements present difficulties for the reasonable scheduling of computing requests to the edge cloud. The Power Allocation (PA) problem for mobile users to address this issue. This problem attempts to use quasiconvex technique to minimize energy consumption. Next, the Joint Request Offloading and Resource Scheduling (JRORS) problem is treated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem to minimize request delay and improve welfare. The request offloading problem and the computational resource scheduling challenge are two subproblems of the JRORS problem that can be further broken down, the JRORS issue is therefore viewed as a dual decision-making problem. A Ratio of Power Consumption to Welfare (RCW) problem through mathematical modeling. An improved snake optimizer (SO) is therefore proposed, which was added with oscillation factor to optimize the location of the weight parameter in the location update and the variation of food production. It can enhance the global search capability and local search ability. By conducting simulation experiments, divide the mobile users into nine groups for testing, select energy consumption, welfare, and RCW as the objective functions, respectively, and compare them with other swarm optimization algorithms, such as Differential Evolution (DE), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant-Lion Optimizer (ALO), Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA), and Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO). The improved algorithm achieved minimal energy consumption and optimal welfare in nearly every test case, contributing to the enhanced effectiveness and cost-efficiency of edge systems, thereby achieving the optimization of task offloading and scheduling. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Safety is a top concern for the civil aviation industry, and the risk of safety accidents will increase due to pilot fatigue. To ensure the safety of civil aviation, this paper proposes a method to solve the crew scheduling problem considering pilot fatigue. In order to reflect individual differences and fatigue levels of pilots, an improved three-stage alertness calculation model is first proposed based on subjective and objective perspectives to represent pilots’ alertness levels and fatigue working duration quantitatively. Then, for the crew scheduling problem considering pilot fatigue, a mixed integer programming model is constructed to simultaneously achieve the optimization objectives of reducing the overall scheduling cost and crew fatigue working duration. Next, since the actual crew scheduling problem is large-scale, a solution algorithm based on a column generation framework is developed to improve the quality and efficiency of solving the large-scale crew scheduling problem. Furthermore, in the case study, we collected actual data from an airline company to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Finally, through multiple experimental comparisons and analyses, to balance the two optimization objectives mentioned above, it is more reasonable to handle pilot fatigue working duration with soft constraints. Sensitivity analysis reveals the variation rules of the crew cost and fatigue, providing some valuable managerial insights for the crew scheduling problem considering pilot fatigue. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.},

	abstract = {Prioritizing the development of public transport is an effective way to improve the sustainability of the transport system. In recent years, bus passenger flow has been declining in many cities. How to reform the operating mode of the public transportation system is an important issue that needs to be solved. An autonomous modular bus (AMB) is capable of physical coupling and uncoupling to flexibly adjust vehicle capacity as well as provide high-quality service under unbalanced passenger demand conditions. To promote AMB adoption and reduce the operating cost of the bus route, this paper presents a joint optimization method to simultaneously determine the AMB dispatching plan, charging plan, and charging infrastructure configuration scheme. Then, a mixed-integer programming model is formulated to minimize the operating costs of the bus route. A hybrid intelligent algorithm combining enumeration, cloning algorithm, and particle swarm optimization algorithm is designed to resolve the formulated model. Subsequently, an actual bus route is taken as an example to validate the proposed method. Results indicate that the developed method in this paper can reduce the operating costs and operational energy consumption of the route compared with the real route operating plan. Specifically, the reduction ratio of the former is 23.85%, and the reduction ratio of the latter is 5.92%. The results of this study validate the feasibility and advantages of autonomous modular transit service, contributing positively to the sustainable development of the urban public transportation system. © 2024 by the authors.},

In this case, the outbound scheduling of steel plates is a challenging issue since its efficiency and complexity are impacted by both steel plate shuffling and truck loading sequencing. To overcome this challenge, we propose to jointly optimize steel plate shuffling and truck loading sequencing (SPS-TLS) by utilizing the data of steel plates and trucks collected by Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The SPS-TLS problem is firstly transformed as an orders scheduling problem which is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. Then an alternating iteration algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (AltDRL) is proposed to solve the SPS-TLS problem. In AltDRL, the deep Q network (DQN) with prioritized experience replay (PER) and the heuristic algorithm are combined to iteratively obtain the near-optimal shuffling position of blocking plates and truck sequence. Experiments are executed based on data collected from a real steel logistics park. The results confirm that AltDRL can significantly reduce the number of plate shuffles and improve the outbound scheduling efficiency of steel plates. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in production scheduling have arisen in response to the need for adaptation in dynamic environments. This paper addresses the challenge of real-time scheduling within the context of sustainable production. We redefine the sustainable distributed permutation flow-shop scheduling problem using an online mixed-integer programming model. The proposed model prioritizes minimizing makespan while simultaneously constraining energy consumption, reducing the number of lost working days and increasing job opportunities within permissible limits. Our approach considers machines operating in different modes, ranging from manual to automatic, and employs two real-time scheduling strategies: predictive-reactive and proactive-reactive scheduling. We evaluate two rescheduling policies: continuous and event-driven. To demonstrate the model's applicability, we present a case study in auto workpiece production. We manage model complexity through various reformulations and heuristics, such as Lagrangian relaxation and Benders decomposition for initial optimization as well as four problem-specific heuristics for real-time considerations. For solving large-scale instances, we employ simulated annealing and tabu search metaheuristic algorithms. Our findings underscore the benefits of the predictive-reactive scheduling strategy and the efficiency of the event-driven rescheduling policy. By addressing dynamic scheduling challenges and integrating sustainability criteria, this study contributes valuable insights into real-time scheduling and sustainable production. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {To evaluate the potential market revenue increase coming from the installation of a hybrid battery energy storage system (HESS) paired with a wind plant, a model is proposed for optimizing the simultaneous participation of the plant in the day-ahead (DA) and the automatic frequency restoration reserve (aFRR) markets. In the analysis, the Danish market is assumed as a case study. The HESS is composed of a combination of lithium-ion (LiB) and vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB). The optimal dispatching problem is solved as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), using a robust formulation to consider the uncertainty of the aFRR market. The developed economic model incorporates the influence of cyclic degradation on the lithium-ion battery's life, considering it dependent on the number of cycles and the depth-of-discharge of each cycle. The economic and technical effects of hybridization are investigated for different storage sizes. Furthermore, the impact of robust optimization, in contrast to non-robust optimization, is investigated along with the impact of detailed storage models, which consider variable efficiencies and variable charging and discharging rates, in contrast to simple models, which consider constant storage efficiencies. Results show that the hybridization between lithium-ion and vanadium batteries positively influences the life of lithium-ion batteries, increasing its life by up to 47% compared to a case without hybridization. For a 10 MW wind farm, the optimal battery configuration is comprised of a hybrid system made of a 1 MW/1MWh LiB and a VRFB of negligible size, with 2 years of payback time. The simultaneous participation in both the DA and aFRR markets proves to be advantageous with annual revenue increases of 39%–56% compared to the system bidding on the sole DA market, regardless of the storage size. The revenue increase attributed to the battery installation does not ensure the feasibility of investment, due to the high cost of the battery technologies, even if the hybrid configuration proves to be more profitable than the non-hybrid configuration. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Matheuristic is an optimisation methodology that integrates mathematical approaches and heuristics to address intractable combinatorial optimisation problems, where a common framework is to insert mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models as local search functions for evolutionary algorithms. However, since a mathematical programming formulation only tries to find the solution with the best objective value, matheuristics are rarely adopted to multi-objective scenarios asking for a set of Pareto optimal solutions, for example, vehicle routing problems and production scheduling problems. In this situation, the ɛ-constraint, which transforms multi-objective problems into single-objective formulations by considering selected objectives as constraints, seems to be a promising approach. First, an augmented ɛ-constraint-based matheuristic methodology (ɛ-MH) is proposed to apply the idea of ɛ-constraint to embedded MILP models, so that Pareto fronts obtained by meta-heuristics can be further improved by solving a set of MILP models. Afterwards, four speed-up strategies are developed to alleviate the computational burden resulting from repeatedly solving mathematical formulations, which also imply preferable scenarios for taking advantages of the ɛ-MH. Finally, several real-world bi-objective scheduling problems are discussed to present potential applications for the proposed methodology. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The sharing economy is among the top trending topics in operations research. In this paper, we introduce a novel sharing application encountered in the construction industry. The problem under research, which has been developed in close cooperation with an industrial partner, is concerned with the on-site accommodation of trades in large-scale construction projects. In such projects, a construction logistics company provides containers gathered in an area of the site and assigns trades to them based on their requests issued online. Usually, a single trade will only remain on-site for a certain period of time, i. e. for as long as it is carrying out its activities in the project. Similarly, containers will only be provided for a certain time interval. This dynamic nature may require re-assigning trades as the project progresses. As such re-assignments impose costs for the logistics company, it is the goal to keep them to a minimum. We formally define the resulting optimization problem, present two mixed-integer programming formulations and develop a fix-and-optimize heuristic. In an extensive computational study, we show the latter to not only clearly outperform standard solver CPLEX operating on the holistic mixed-integer program, but to also provide substantial savings over the assignment policy currently applied in practice. © 2023},

	abstract = {The advent of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Service Function Chains (SFCs) unleashes the power of dynamic creation of network services using Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). This is of great interest to network operators since poor service quality and resource wastage can potentially hurt their revenue in the long term. However, the study shows with a set of test-bed experiments that packet loss at certain positions (i.e., different VNFs) in an SFC can cause various degrees of resource wastage and performance degradation because of repeated upstream processing and transmission of retransmitted packets. To overcome this challenge, this study focuses on resource scheduling and deployment of SFCs while considering packet loss positions. This study developed a novel SFC packet dropping cost model and formulated an SFC scheduling problem that aims to minimize overall packet dropping cost as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and proved that it is NP-hard. In this study, Palos is proposed as an efficient scheme in exploiting the functional characteristics of VNFs and their positions in SFCs for scheduling resources and deployment to optimize packet dropping cost. Extensive experiment results show that Palos can achieve up to 42.73% improvement on packet dropping cost and up to 33.03% reduction on average SFC latency when compared with two other state-of-the-art schemes. © 2023 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications},

	abstract = {The Electric Autonomous Dial-A-Ride Problem (E-ADARP) consists in scheduling a fleet of electric autonomous vehicles to provide ride-sharing services for customers that specify their origins and destinations. The E-ADARP considers the following perspectives: (i) a weighted-sum objective that minimizes both total travel time and total excess user ride time; (ii) the employment of electric autonomous vehicles and a partial recharging policy. This paper presents the first labeling algorithm for a path-based formulation of the DARP/E-ADARP, where the main ingredient includes: (1) fragment-based representation of paths, (2) a novel approach that abstracts fragments to arcs while ensuring excess-user-ride-time optimality, (3) construction of a sparser new graph with the abstracted arcs, which is proven to preserve all feasible routes of the original graph, and (4) strong dominance rules and constant-time feasibility checks to compute the shortest paths efficiently. This labeling algorithm is then integrated into Branch-and-Price (B&P) algorithms to solve the E-ADARP. In the computational experiments, the B&P algorithm achieves optimality in 71 out of 84 instances. Remarkably, among these instances, 50 were solved optimally at the root node without branching. We identify 26 new best solutions, improve 30 previously reported lower bounds, and provide 17 new lower bounds for large-scale instances with up to 8 vehicles and 96 requests. In total 42 new best solutions are generated on previously solved and unsolved instances. In addition, we analyze the impact of incorporating the total excess user ride time within the objectives and allowing unlimited visits to recharging stations. The following managerial insights are provided: (1) solving a weighted-sum objective function can significantly enhance the service quality, while still maintaining operational costs at nearly optimal levels, (2) the relaxation on charging visits allows us to solve all instances feasibly and further reduces the average solution cost. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

The problem was defined from the perspective of a project manager involved in planning such operations on a day-by-day basis. The problem statement was then transformed into a simplified Integer Linear Programming optimization model. Performance metrics were devised to evaluate the optimization model’s effectiveness. A heuristic algorithm representing the decision-making process by a seasoned planner in the partner company was also developed. Both methods were applied to a case study and contrasted based on the same performance metrics. The findings underscored substantial optimization benefits in rendering decision support in resource-constrained drainage construction operations planning. In conclusion, this research presents an alternative strategy for navigating the complexities inherent in finite crew resource allocation on multiple concurrent drainage projects; lends a cost-effective optimization solution to improving the utilization of finite available crews while satisfying service demands from multiple clients to the largest extent possible. © 2024 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Cost reduction and staff retention are important optimization objectives in home healthcare (HHC) systems. Home healthcare operators need to balance their objectives by optimizing resource use, service delivery and profits. Minimizing total travel distances to control costs is a common routing problem objective while minimizing total finishing time differences is a scheduling objective whose purpose is to enhance staff satisfaction. To optimize routing and scheduling, we propose mixed integer linear programming with a bi-objective function, which is a subset of the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTWs). VRPTWs is a known NP-hard problem, and optimal solutions are very hard to obtain in practice. Metaheuristics offer an alternative solution to this type of problem. Our metaheuristic uses the simulated annealing algorithm and weighted sum approach to convert the problems to single-objective problems and is equipped with operators including swapping, moving, path exchange and ruin and recreate. The results show, firstly, that the algorithm can effectively find the Pareto front, and secondly, that minimizing total finishing time differences to balance the number of jobs per caretaker is an efficient way to tackle HHC scheduling. A statistical test shows that the algorithm can obtain the Pareto front with a lower number of weighted sum problems. © 2024 by the authors.},

An essential aspect of this adaptation is effectively managing the workday schedule to minimize social contact. This paper introduces a comprehensive optimization framework designed to automate the planning of employee schedules during pandemic events. Our framework utilizes integer linear programming to establish a set of general constraints that can accommodate various types of distancing restrictions and cater to different objective functions. To employ the framework, a company simply needs to instantiate a subset of these constraints along with an objective function based on its specific priorities. We conducted tests on our scheduling framework within three distinct real-life companies, yielding promising results. Our approach successfully increased the number of in-person workers by 15%, all while adhering to the social distancing restrictions mandated by these companies. Furthermore, the solutions generated by our method were implemented and validated within these organizations. © 2024, Brazilian Computing Society. All rights reserved.},

This research transcends geographical boundaries by conducting an extended analysis of various energy communities and diverse energy markets across Europe, encompassing different regions of Italy. Our methodology involves the implementation of an RL controller, leveraging optimal control theory for training and utilizing only real-time data available at the current time step during the test phase. Through simulations conducted in diverse contexts, we demonstrate the superior performance of our RL agent compared to a state-of-the-art rule-based controller. The agent exhibits remarkable adaptability to various scenarios, consistently surpassing existing rule-based controllers.

The expensive low-sulfur fuels are required to be used in Emission Control Area, leading to increased sulfide emissions due to bypassing by ship operators. It creates new challenges for navigation and power generation scheduling of all-electric ships. This article presents a new bi-objective joint optimization scheme for ship sailing routes and energy management. It considers emission control strategies to balance the total cost of operation and sulfur dioxide emissions throughout the ship's voyage. Unlike previous optimization problems with fixed routes and sailing time, the influence of emission policies on the operator's navigation decisions is considered. The route options and sailing time are treated as variables embedded in the model. In addition, the optimization accuracy is improved by integrating the model into mixed integer linear programming through a modified piecewise linearization model. The results show that the total operating cost for the same route is reduced by 6.05%, and the SO2 emission is 8.36% after integrating the emission policy influencing factor in the model. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated, and the model's necessity for optimizing ship power generation and voyage within Emission Control Area is also illustrated. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a strategic solution to address the increasing demand for cellular connectivity in rural, remote, and disaster-hit regions lacking traditional infrastructure. However, UAVs’ limited onboard energy storage necessitates optimized, energy-efficient communication strategies and intelligent energy expenditure to maximize productivity. This work proposes a novel joint optimization model to coordinate charging operations across multiple UAVs functioning as aerial base stations. The model optimizes charging station assignments and trajectories to maximize UAV flight time and minimize overall energy expenditure. By leveraging both static ground base stations and mobile supercharging stations for opportunistic charging while considering battery chemistry constraints, the mixed integer linear programming approach reduces energy usage by 9.1 ​% versus conventional greedy heuristics. The key results provide insights into separating charging strategies based on UAV mobility patterns, fully utilizing all available infrastructure through balanced distribution, and strategically leveraging existing base stations before deploying dedicated charging assets. Compared to myopic localized decisions, the globally optimized solution extends battery life and enhances productivity. Overall, this work marks a significant advance in UAV energy management by consolidating multiple improvements within a unified coordination framework focused on joint charging optimization across UAV fleets. The model lays a critical foundation for energy-efficient aerial network deployments to serve the connectivity needs of the future. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Local energy communities (LECs) are expected to play a vital role in this context. However, energy scheduling in LECs presents various challenges, including the preservation of customer privacy, adherence to distribution network constraints, and the management of computational burdens. This paper introduces a novel approach for energy scheduling in renewable-based LECs using a decentralized optimization method. The proposed approach uses the Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) method, significantly reducing the computational effort required for solving the mixed integer programming (MIP) problem. It incorporates network constraints, evaluates energy losses, and enables community participants to provide ancillary services like a regulation reserve to the grid utility. To assess its robustness and efficiency, the proposed approach is tested on an 84-bus radial distribution network. Results indicate that the proposed distributed approach not only matches the accuracy of the corresponding centralized model but also exhibits scalability and preserves participant privacy.  © 2015 CSEE.},

	abstract = {The relentless growth of global energy consumption poses a multitude of complex challenges, including the depletion of finite energy resources and the exacerbation of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. In the face of these pressing environmental concerns, the manufacturing sector, a significant energy consumer, is under immense pressure to adopt sustainable practices. The critical intersection of energy consumption management and production operation scheduling emerges as a pivotal domain for addressing these challenges. The scheduling of common operations, exemplified by the cutting stock problem in industries like furniture and apparel, represents a prevalent challenge in production environments. For the first time, this paper pioneers an investigation into an identical parallel machine scheduling problem, taking into account common operations to minimize total energy consumption and total completion time concurrently. For this purpose, two bi-objective mixed integer linear programming models are presented, and an augmented ε – constraint method is used to obtain the Pareto optimal front for small-scale instances. Considering the NP-hardness of this problem, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and a hybrid non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with particle swarm optimization (HNSGAII-PSO) are developed to solve medium- and large-scale instances to achieve good approximate Pareto fronts. The performance of the proposed algorithms is assessed by conducting computational experiments on test problems. The results demonstrate that the proposed HNSGAII-PSO performs better than the suggested NSGA-II in solving the test problems. © 2024 Materials and Energy Research Center. All rights reserved.},

We characterize this as the Home Services Assignment and Routing Problem with the Triple Bottom Line (HSARP-TBL) and implement a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for solving it. We assign service professionals to customers based on their desired time slots and also transport modes for each customer visit by a professional, considering either combinations of public transport or a personal vehicle for each professional's tour. The objective is to minimize costs due to time window violations and uncovered customers, catering to the economic pillar of the TBL. We incorporate additional constraints related to the TBL by improving customer satisfaction based on the ratings of assigned professionals to customers, with and without subscription (economic), controlling emissions due to transportation of professionals (environmental) and ensuring equity in service allocation and net earnings between professionals (social). For tackling large instances we implement a Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS) algorithm adapting it to our problem setting. We demonstrate that the HGS outperforms the MILP model systematically for large instances in terms of solution value and computational time. Finally, we observe that for some instances, without worsening the primary economic objective, all the TBL indicators can be improved. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {With the load center’s continuous expansion and development of the AC power grid’s scale and construction, the recipient grid under the multi-feed DC environment is facing severe challenges of DC commutation failure and bipolar blocking due to the high strength of AC-DC coupling and the low level of system inertia, which brings many complexities and uncertainties to economic scheduling. In addition, the large-scale grid integration of wind power, photovoltaic, and other intermittent energy sources makes the ultra-high-voltage (UHV) DC channel operation state randomized. The deterministic scenario-based timing power simulation is no longer suitable for the current complex and changeable grid operation state. In this paper, we first start with the description and analysis of the uncertainty in renewable energy (RE) sources, such as wind and solar, and reconstruct the time-sequence power model by using the stochastic differential equation model. Then, a carbon emission trading cost (CET) model is constructed based on the CET mechanism, and the two-stage locating and capacity optimization model for the UHV DC receiving end is proposed under the constraint of dispatch safety and stability. Among them, the first stage starts with the objective of maximizing the carrying capacity of the UHV DC receiving end grid; the second stage checks its dynamic safety under the basic and fault modes according to the results of the first stage and corrects the drop point and capacity of the UHV DC line with the objective of achieving safe and stable UHV DC operation at the lowest economic investment. In addition, the two-stage model innovatively proposes UHV DC relative inertia constraints, peak adjustment margin constraints, transient voltage support constraints under commutation failure conditions, and frequency support constraints under a DC blocking state. In addition, to address the problem that the probabilistic constraints of the scheduling model are difficult to solve, the discrete step-size transformation and convolution sequence operation methods are proposed to transform the chance-constrained planning into mixed-integer linear planning for solving. Finally, the proposed model is validated with a UHV DC channel in 2023, and the results confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of the model. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {— Owing to the controlling flexibility and cost-effectiveness, fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to serve as flying base stations (BSs) in the air-ground integrated network. By exploiting the mobility of UAVs, controllable coverage can be provided for mobile group users (MGUs) under challenging scenarios or even somewhere without communication infrastructure. However, in such dual mobility scenario where the UAV and MGUs are all moving, both the non-hovering feature of the fixed-wing UAV and the movement of MGUs will exacerbate the dynamic changes of user scheduling, which eventually leads to the degradation of MGUs’ quality-of-service (QoS). In this paper, we propose a fixed-wing UAV-enabled wireless network architecture to provide moving coverage for MGUs. In order to achieve fairness among MGUs, we maximize the minimum average throughput between all users by jointly optimizing the user scheduling, resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control under the constraints on users’ QoS requirements, communication resources, and UAV trajectory switching. Considering the optimization problem is mixed-integer non-convex, we decompose it into three optimization subproblems. An efficient algorithm is proposed to solve these three subproblems alternately till the convergence is realized. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the minimum average throughput of MGUs. © 2024 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

	abstract = {The integration of large-scale heat pumps and thermal energy storage can facilitate sector coupling, potentially lowering heating and cooling costs in industries and buildings. This cost reduction can be extended by optimizing the utilization of the available thermal energy storage capacity in accordance to fluctuating electricity prices. Although the literature offers methods for optimizing the operation of these integrated systems, they often overlook the impact of heat pump performance degradation over time, such as from fouling. This oversight can lead to suboptimal system performance and inaccurate operational cost estimates. The present study addresses this gap by introducing a novel operational scheduling framework that aimed to reduce the operational costs of a commercial large-scale heat pump system. The system comprised an open cooling tower, a thermal storage tank and two heat pumps affected by fouling. The framework incorporated a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, thermal demand forecasting, and heat pump performance maps that account for varying fouling levels. These maps were obtained from online calibrated simulation models used as digital twins of the heat pumps. The results demonstrated that the proposed framework enhanced the thermal energy storage utilization in response to variable electricity prices and adjusted the heat pump operation based on the influence of fouling. This resulted in a reduction of operational costs of up to 5% compared to the conventional operation of the system. These savings were observed to vary depending on the forecasting accuracy and the prevailing fouling levels. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of using the proposed framework for cost reduction in large-scale heat pump systems. © 2024 The Authors},

The increasing demand for energy flexibility from the demand side is crucial for ensuring the power grid's economic stability and resilience. Buildings offer a range of potential flexibility sources that can be effectively leveraged for this purpose. Accordingly, this paper formulates energy flow management in a Smart House using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) framework, incorporating the scheduling of shiftable appliances and an Energy Storage System (ESS). By defining different consumption strategies, the feasible region for Energy-Time Profiles (ETPs) is explored through the establishment of the corresponding optimization problems. A series of case studies are presented to evaluate the impact of operational constraints on the feasible region. Finally, by meticulously analyzing the characteristics of ETPs extracted from these case studies, the proposed flexibility indicators are introduced, quantifying the Smart House's energy flexibility potential. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to scrutinize the influence of key parameters on the new flexibility indicator, encompassing ESS characteristics. The findings substantiate the efficacy of the proposed indicators in providing comprehensive insights into the potential energy flexibility under a range of operational conditions. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Due to a wide variety of real-world constraints, proper project portfolio selection is a critical issue for project-oriented organizations. In this paper, a bi-objective stochastic mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to cope with the project selection and scheduling problem in the presence of greenhouse gas emissions, and non-hazardous/hazardous wastes regulatory restrictions. Moreover, reinvesting proceeds of projects as well as loans are allowed to finance projects over the planning horizon. The proposed model maximizes the net present value of the expected project portfolio's terminal wealth under uncertain conditions, as well as the sustainability score of the project portfolio, simultaneously. The sustainability score is calculated by one of the recent multi-criteria decision-making methods, SECA, based on seven qualitative sustainability indicators and by solving a non-linear optimization model. To assess the performance of the proposed model, a case study of eighteen industrial projects is applied. Since the duration of industrial projects is usually uncertain, the proposed model is reformulated as a scenario-based stochastic programming model. Furthermore, the CPLEX solver and Branch and Benders algorithm are used to solve the problem. Results show that the Branch and Benders algorithm is much more efficient than the CPLEX solver. Results show that increasing the carbon and landfill tax rates is not always an appropriate decision made by policymakers to control various types of emissions. Such decisions may not only make the projects less attractive for investment but also, do not significantly reduce the negative environmental effects, which decreases sustainability in both economic and environmental dimensions. This highlights the importance of considering each problem’s attitudes for setting regulations where copying does not always create the same solutions for sustainability issues. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.},

An appropriate self-scheduling model can guarantee AA-CAES's profit and attract investments. However, very few studies refer to the cogeneration ability of AA-CAES, which enables the possibility to trade in the electricity and heat markets at the same time. In this paper, we propose a multi-market self-scheduling model to make full use of heat produced in compressors. The volatile market price is modeled by a set of inexact distributions based on historical data through o-divergence. Then, the self-scheduling model is cast as a robust risk constrained program by introducing Stackelberg game theory, and equivalently reformulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). The numerical simulation results validate the proposed method and demonstrate that participating in multi-energy markets increases overall profits.

	abstract = {Public transport agencies need to leverage on emerging technologies to remain competitive in a mobility landscape that is increasingly subject to disruptive mobility services ranging from ride-hailing to shared micro-mobility. Customized bus (CB) is an innovative transit system that provides advanced, personalized, and flexible demand-responsive transit service by using digital travel platforms. One of the challenging tasks in planning and operating a CB system is to efficiently and practically schedule a set of CB vehicles while meeting passengers’ personalized travel demand. Previous studies assume that CB passengers’ preferred pickup or delivery time is within a pre-defined hard time window, which is fixed and cannot change. However, some recent studies show that introducing soft flexible time windows can further reduce operational costs. Considering soft flexible time windows, this study first proposes a nearest neighbour-based passenger-to-vehicle assignment algorithm to assign CB passengers to vehicle trips and generate the required vehicle service trips. Then, a novel bi-objective integer programming model is proposed to optimize CB operation cost (measured by fleet size) and level of service (measured by passenger departure time deviation penalty cost). Model reformulations are conducted to make the bi-objective model solvable by using commercial optimization solvers, together with a deficit function-based graphical vehicle scheduling technique. A novel two-stage human–machine collaborative optimization methodology, which makes use of both machine intelligence and human intelligence to collaboratively solve the problem, is developed to generate more practical Pareto-optimal CB scheduling results. Computation results of a real-world CB system demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed optimization model and solution methodology. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Preventive Maintenance (PM) is a periodic maintenance strategy that has great results for devices in extending their lives, increasing productivity, and, most importantly, helping to avoid unexpected breakdowns and their costly consequences. Preventive maintenance scheduling (PMS) is determining the time for carrying out PM, and it represents a sensitive issue in terms of impact on production if the time for the PM process is not optimally distributed. This study employs hybrid heuristic methods, integrating Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Tabu Search (TS), to address the PMS problem. Notably, the search for an optimal solution remained elusive with GA alone until the inclusion of TS. The resultant optimal solution is achieved swiftly, surpassing the time benchmarks set by conventional methods like integer programming and nonlinear integer programming. A comparison with a published article that used metaheuristics was also applied in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid approach in terms of solution quality and convergence speed. Moreover, sensitivity analysis underscores the robustness and efficacy of the hybrid approach, consistently yielding optimal solutions across diverse scenarios. The schedule created exceeds standards set by waterworks experts, yielding significant water and electricity surpluses—16.6% and 12.1%, respectively—while simultaneously matching or surpassing total production levels. This method can be used for power plants in private or public sectors to generate an optimal PMS, save money, and avoid water or electricity cuts. In summary, this hybrid approach offers an efficient and effective solution for optimizing PMS, presenting opportunities for enhancement across various industries. © 2024 by the authors.},

The problem arises in an industry located in the Canary Islands (Spain) and is characterized by a set of jobs to be completed on multiple processing lines, where each job has a specific processing time and a sequence-dependent setup time. The objective is to maximize the productivity of the processing lines, subject to constraints such as availability of personnel and processing lines, due dates, precedence order, and setup times, among others. In order to solve this problem, an optimization model that represents the problem as a mixed-integer program is proposed. The paper also introduces a constraint satisfaction heuristic to find near-optimal solutions of the problem.

	abstract = {The optimal allocation of multi-skilled workers in labor-intensive industries can improve production capacity and reduce production costs. In actual production, the efficiency of workers will change with time due to their proficiency, fatigue, and other effects. In this article, we attempt to solve the problem of multi-skilled workers allocation in unit brake production lines considering the heterogeneity of skills and time-varying effects. A nonlinear mixed-integer programming model is established, which fully considers the impact of worker efficiency due to proficiency, fatigue, and multi-task rest recovery. The product production cycle and worker cost are the two objectives of the optimization solution. An enhanced NSGA-II algorithm that combines the improved NSGA-II algorithm and the variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm is used to solve the multiobjective optimization problem. Finally, the weighted ideal point method is used to obtain the Pareto optimal solution. The application case of a unit brake production is considered to evaluate the proposed model. The results indicate that the time cost and salary cost of workers are reduced by 8.03% and 18.91% compared with the original scheduling. The scheduling model considering learning, fatigue and recovery factors is more suitable for the actual production situation, ensuring the completion time and reducing the labor cost. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {The last few years have seen the massive deployment of electric buses in many existing transit networks. However, the planning and operation of an electric bus system differ from that of a bus system with conventional vehicles, and some key problems have not yet been studied in the literature. In this work, we address the integrated operational control and charging scheduling problem for a network of electric buses with a limited opportunity charging capacity. Operational control is carried out through speed control of the vehicles and bus holding at the terminal. We propose a hierarchical control framework to solve this integrated problem, where the charging and operational decisions are taken jointly by solving a mixed-integer linear program in the high-level control layer. Since this optimization problem might become very large as more bus lines are considered, we propose to apply Lagrangian relaxation in such a way as to exploit the structure of the problem and enable a decomposition into independent subproblems. A local search heuristic is then deployed in order to generate good feasible solutions to the original problem. This entire Lagrangian heuristic procedure is shown to scale much better on transit networks with an increasing number of bus lines than trying to solve the original problem with an off-the-shelf solver. The proposed procedure is then tested in the high-fidelity microscopic traffic environment Vissim on a bus network constructed from an openly available dataset of the city of Chicago. The results show the benefits of combining the charging scheduling decisions with the real-time operational control of the vehicles as the proposed control framework manages to achieve both a better level of service and lower charging costs over control baselines with predetermined charging schedules. © 2024 The Author(s)},

In this paper, a multi-cell content scheduling problem (MCSP) in MEC systems is considered. Taking into account jointly the freshness of the cached contents and the traffic data costs, we study how to schedule content updates along time in a multi-cell setting. Different from single-cell scenarios, a user may have multiple candidate local cache servers, and thus the caching decisions in all cells must be jointly optimized. We first prove that MCSP is NP-hard, then we formulate MCSP using integer linear programming, by which the optimal scheduling can be obtained for small-scale instances. For problem solving of large scenarios, via a mathematical reformulation, we derive a scalable optimization algorithm based on repeated column generation. Our performance evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in comparison to an off-the-shelf commercial solver and a popularity-based caching. © 2024 The Author(s)},

In Ireland, the number of installed roof-top photovoltaics (PVs) and home batteries, known as behind-the-meter (BTM) resources, has significantly increased in recent years, accelerated by grants administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). In this work, an optimization tool that uses a combination of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MOMILP) model is developed. This tool integrates an optimal battery control scheme from the MOMILP model aiming to minimize electricity bills and battery degradation to optimize the sizing of BTM batteries with minimum installation costs. Various scenarios have been simulated to assess the potential of the proposed model under different metering and billing systems, and optimization constraints.

	abstract = {Technological advancements in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have revolutionized various industries, enabling the widespread adoption of UAV-based solutions. In engineering management, UAV-based inspection has emerged as a highly efficient method for identifying hidden risks in high-risk construction environments, surpassing traditional inspection techniques. Building on this foundation, this paper delves into the optimization of UAV inspection routing and scheduling, addressing the complexity introduced by factors such as no-fly zones, monitoring-interval time windows, and multiple monitoring rounds. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that optimizes inspection task assignments, monitoring sequence schedules, and charging decisions. The comprehensive consideration of these factors differentiates our problem from conventional vehicle routing problem (VRP), leading to a mathematically intractable model for commercial solvers in the case of large-scale instances. To overcome this limitation, we design a tailored variable neighborhood search (VNS) metaheuristic, customizing the algorithm to efficiently solve our model. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm, demonstrating its scalability for both large-scale and real-scale instances. Sensitivity experiments and a case study based on an actual engineering project are also conducted, providing valuable insights for engineering managers to enhance inspection work efficiency. © 2024},

The objective of this paper is to establish a distributionally robust demand response (DR) model for building energy systems for suppressing peak-to-valley load ratios by exploiting cooperative complementarity and flexible transformation characteris-tics of various household appliances. The thermodynamic effect of buildings is modeled for harvesting intermittent renewable energy sources (RESs) on the building roof in the form of thermal energy storages to reduce RES curtailments and eliminate thermal comfort violations in cold weather. Furthermore, the Wasserstein metric is adopted to develop the ambiguity set of the uncertainty probability distributions (PDs) of RESs, and thus, only historical data of RES output is needed rather than prior knowledge about the actual PDs. Finally, a computationally tractable mixed-integer linear programming reformulation is derived for the original distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model. The proposed DRO-based DR strategy was performed on multiple buildings over a 24 h scheduling horizon, and comparative studies have validated the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for building energy systems in reducing the peak/valley ratio and decreasing operation costs. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-aided device-to-device (D2D) networks have attracted great interests with the development of 5G/6G communications, while there are several challenges about resource scheduling in UAVs-aided D2D networks. In this work, we formulate a UAVs-aided D2D network resource scheduling optimization problem (NetResSOP) to comprehensively consider the number of deployed UAVs, UAV positions, UAV transmission powers, UAV flight velocities, communication channels, and UAV-device pair assignment so as to maximize the D2D network capacity, minimize the number of deployed UAVs, and minimize the average energy consumption over all UAVs simultaneously. The formulated NetResSOP is a mixed-integer programming problem (MIPP) and an NP-hard problem, which means that it is difficult to be solved in polynomial time. Moreover, there are trade-offs between the optimization objectives, and hence it is also difficult to find an optimal solution that can simultaneously make all objectives be optimal. Thus, we propose a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III with a Flexible solution dimension mechanism, a Discrete part generation mechanism, and a UAV number adjustment mechanism (NSGA-III-FDU) for solving the problem comprehensively. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and the stability of the proposed NSGA-III-FDU under different scales and settings of the D2D networks.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneous multicore architectures have become one of the most widely used hardware platforms for embedded systems, where time, energy, and system QoS are the major concerns. The Imprecise Computation (IC) model splits a task into mandatory and optional parts, allowing the trade-off of the above issues. However, existing approaches, to maximize system QoS (Quality-of-Service) under time or energy constraints, use a linear function to model system QoS. Therefore, they become unsuitable for general applications, whose QoS is modeled by a concave function. To deal with this limitation, this brief addresses the Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problem of mapping IC tasks to a set of heterogeneous cores by concurrently deciding which processor executes each task and the number of cycles of optional tasks (i.e., task allocation and scheduling), under real-time and energy supply constraints. Furthermore, as existing solution algorithms either demand high time complexity or only achieve feasible solutions, we propose a novel approach based on problem transformation and dual decomposition that finds an optimal solution while avoiding high computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves 98% performance of the optimization solver Gurobi, but only with 19.8% of its computation time. © 2023 IEEE.},

This work envisions a scenario in which a swarm of UAVs equipped with IRSs serves multiple Internet of Things (IoT) ground nodes (GNs) concurrently transmitting to a single base station (BS) via OFDMA. The huge number of passive elements composing the IRSs introduces a significant complexity in the mission design. Therefore, each IRS is divided into patches that can be simultaneously used to serve different nodes. Considering general Rician fading, a comprehensive channel model for IRS-Assisted UAV-Aided networks is derived. Then, a multiobjective mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is conceived to maximize the sum-rate of the GNs and, at the same time, minimize the difference among the users' data rates, by jointly optimizing the trajectories and the phase shift matrices. This nonconvex problem, reformulated in terms of scheduling (i.e., patch-GN assignment), is challenging to solve. Hence, it is rearranged as a Markov Decision Process and a quasi-optimal solution is obtained via Deep Reinforcement Learning. Extensive simulation analysis is performed to validate the results and the accuracy of the proposed model.  © 2014 IEEE.},

However, low latency service provisioning is still challenging due to the fast variation of network topology and limited onboard resource at low earth orbit satellites. To address this issue, we study service provisioning in SDSTNs via joint optimization of virtual network function (VNF) placement and routing planning with network dynamics characterized by a time-evolving graph. Aiming at minimizing average service latency, the corresponding problem is formulated as an integer nonlinear programming under resource, VNF deployment, and time-slotted flow constraints. Since exhaustive search is intractable, we transform the primary problem into an integer linear programming by involving auxiliary variables and then propose a Benders decomposition based branch-and-cut (BDBC) algorithm. Towards practical use, a time expansion-based decoupled greedy (TEDG) algorithm is further designed with rigorous complexity analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the optimality of BDBC algorithm and the low complexity of TEDG algorithm. Meanwhile, it is indicated that they can improve the number of completed services within a configuration period by up to 58% and reduce the average service latency by up to 17% compared to baseline schemes.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper considers a joint pollution-routing with time windows and speed optimization problem (PRP-SO) where vehicle speed, payload, and road grade influence fuel costs and CO2e emissions. We present two advanced optimization methods (i.e., approximate and exact) for solving the PRP-SO. The approximate strategy solves large-scale instances of the problem with a Tabu search-based metaheuristic coupled with an efficient fixed-sequence speed optimization algorithm. The second strategy consists of a tailored branch-and-price (BP) algorithm to manage speed optimization within the pricing problem. We test both methods on modified Solomon benchmarks and newly constructed real-life instance sets. Our BP algorithm successfully solves the majority of instances involving up to 50 customers and many instances with 75 and 100 customers. The heuristic can find near-optimal solutions to all instances and requires less than one minute of computational time per instance. Results on real-world instances suggest several managerial insights. First, fuel savings of up to 53% can be achieved when explicitly considering arc payloads and road grades. Second, fuel savings and emission reduction can be achieved by scheduling uphill customers later along the routes. Lastly, we show that ignoring elevation information when planning routes leads to highly inaccurate fuel consumption estimates. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The post-disaster surgical scheduling is a type of scheduling problem in healthcare system that occurs after a sudden disaster event. The rescue capacity of hospitals has faced an unprecedented challenge by increasing surgical loads due to the disaster occurrence. Hospital became excessively burdened by the influx of patients, who occupy inpatient beds and operation rooms (ORs), making the availability of medical resources uncertain and scarce. This paper focuses on the post-disaster surgical scheduling problem, considering uncertain demands such as the unknown surgical operation durations or random arrivals of emergency/urgent patients, as well as the interests of multiple stakeholders (patients and hospital managers). The objective of fuzzy post-disaster surgical scheduling (FPDSS) is to simultaneously minimize the expected recovery completion time for all patients (makespan), expected average makespan while prioritizing emergency/ urgent patients, as well as the expected total idle time of ORs. This problem can be formulated as a mixed integer linear multi-objective optimization model, and an improved hunger games search based on Nash equilibrium (IHGS-NE) is developed for FPDSS. Finally, experimental studies have been used to test the performance of the proposed approach, and the presented surgical scheduling scheme is validated. Results show that the IHGS-NE approach is an effective method on the research of the multi-objective FPDSS problem. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Patient admission scheduling (PAS) consists of assigning patients to beds over a planning horizon to maximize treatment efficiency, patient satisfaction, and hospital utilization while meeting all necessary medical constraints and considering patient preferences as much as possible. There are several different variants of the PAS problem in the literature, which differ mainly in the constraints that must be satisfied (hard) or can be violated (soft). Due to the intrinsic difficulty of the PAS problem, solving large integer programming (IP) models to optimality is challenging. In this paper, we consider the widely studied variant of the PAS problem that has the maximum number of soft constraints, and focus on how to reduce the size of IP formulations of the PAS problem to improve the solving efficiency. We employ a two-stage optimization method where the first stage builds reduced models by constraint aggregation to improve the typical formulation of the PAS problem. Experimental results on the 13 benchmark instances in the literature indicate that our method can obtain new improved solutions (new upper bounds) for 6 instances, including one proven optimal solution. For the 5 other instances whose optimal solutions are known, our approach can reach these known optimal solutions in a shorter computation time compared to the existing methods. In addition, we apply our method to the original PAS problem, which has the maximum number of hard constraints, and perform computational experiments on the same 13 benchmark instances. Our method yields 5 new best solutions and proves optimality for 6 instances. © 2024 The Author(s)},

Optimal scheduling benefits both users and the electric network, thus enhancing grid utilization and increasing renewable energy integration. By coordinating power interactions with dynamic time-of-use tariffs, the energy management system minimizes user costs and aids the grid by cutting peak hour energy consumption. Charging and discharging operations in electric vehicles comply with energy level constraints outlined by bidirectional charging protocols. The proposed approach ensures the scheduling of cycles that minimize detrimental effects on battery health when evaluating an economically ageing mechanism. Compared to uncontrolled charging, optimal scheduling resulted in a significant reduction in the total operational cost of the dwelling. Trade-off conditions between renewable integration and potential savings are identified and numerically evaluated by means of multiobjective optimization.

	abstract = {The classic pump scheduling or optimal water flow (OWF) problem for water distribution networks (WDNs) minimizes the cost of power consumption for a given WDN over a fixed time horizon. In its exact form, the OWF is a computationally challenging mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). It is complicated by nonlinear equality constraints that model network physics, discrete variables that model operational controls, and intertemporal constraints that model changes to storage devices. To address the computational challenges of the OWF, this paper develops tight polyhedral relaxations of the original MINLP, derives novel valid inequalities (or cuts) using duality theory, and implements novel optimization-based bound tightening and cut generation procedures. The efficacy of each new method is rigorously evaluated by measuring empirical improvements in OWF primal and dual bounds over 45 literature instances. The evaluation suggests that our relaxation improvements, model strengthening techniques, and a thoughtfully selected polyhedral relaxation partitioning scheme can substantially improve OWF primal and dual bounds, especially when compared with similar relaxation-based techniques that do not leverage these new methods. © 2024 INFORMS.},

	abstract = {Linear assignment problems are well-known combinatorial optimization problems involving domains such as logistics, robotics and telecommunications. In general, obtaining an optimal solution to such problems is computationally infeasible even in small settings, so heuristic algorithms are often used to find near-optimal solutions. In order to attain the right assignment permutation, this study investigates a general-purpose learning strategy that uses a bipartite graph to describe the problem structure and a message passing Graph Neural Network (GNN) model to learn the correct mapping. Comparing the proposed structure with two existing DNN solutions, simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly improves classification accuracy, proving to be very e±cient in terms of processing time and memory requirements, due to its inherent parameter sharing capability. Among the many practical uses that require solving allocation problems in everyday scenarios, we decided to apply the proposed approach to address the scheduling of electric smart meters access within an electricity distribution smart grid infrastructure, since near-real-time energy monitoring is a key element of the green transition that has become increasingly important in recent times. The results obtained show that the proposed graph-based solver, although sub-optimal, exhibits the highest scalability, compared with other state-of-the-art heuristic approaches.

	abstract = {With the implementation of cross-line operation in high-speed railway system, accessibility of cross-line passengers on the railway network has substantially improved. However, due to limitations of capacity, it is hard to schedule a con-flict-free timetable based on a train line plan with many cross-line trains. In order to generate a feasible and optimal transportation plan, a novel method-ology is introduced. The approach can simultaneously optimize both the line plans of cross-line trains and train timetable, aiming at having a trade-off be-tween operating profit and direct service. Based on an event-activity network framework, a mixed integer programming model is established. Considering service quality would decline after optimizing line plan and train schedules, the objective of the model is set to minimize deviations from ideal schedules for main-line trains while maximize direct service frequency for cross-line passen-gers. To solve large-scale scenarios efficiently, an enhanced heuristic genetic algorithm is developed. Two smaller-scale cases are devised to validate the ef-ficiency of the model and approach. Finally, the model and the algorithm are applied to a real-world scenario involving the Beijing-Shanghai High-speed Railway and its connecting lines. Also, comparative experiments, including a scenario without cross-line optimization, are conducted to evaluate the ad-vantage of the proposed approach. The result shows the approach can help to quickly find a feasible solution and have a good balance between operating profit and passenger demand. © 2024 Production Engineering Institute.

	abstract = {Owing to the high acquisition costs, maintenance expenses, and inadequate charging infrastructure associated with electric buses, achieving a complete replacement of diesel buses with electric counterparts in the short term proves challenging. A substantial number of bus operators currently find themselves in a situation where they must integrate electric buses with their existing diesel fleets. Confronted with the constraints of limited electric bus range and charging infrastructure, the primary concern for bus operators is how to effectively utilize their mixed bus fleets to adhere to pre-established bus timetables while maximizing the deployment of electric buses, known for their zero pollution and cost-effective travel. Consequently, this paper introduces the concept of the joint optimization problem for vehicle and recharging scheduling within mixed bus fleets operating under constrained charging conditions. To tackle this issue, a mixed integer linear model is formulated to optimize the coordination of bus schedules and recharging activities within the context of limited charging infrastructure. By establishing a set of feasible charging activities, the problem of electric buses queuing for charging at constrained charging stations is transformed into a linear optimization model constraint. Numerical simulations are conducted within the real transit network of the Dalian Economic Development Zone in China. The results indicate that the judicious joint optimization of vehicle and charging scheduling significantly enhances the service frequency of electric buses while reducing operational costs for bus lines. Notably, the proportion of total trips performed by electric buses rises to 80.4%. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) based on the centralized design faces both challenges regarding the trust issue and a single point of failure. To alleviate these issues, blockchain-aided decentralized FL (BDFL) introduces the decentralized network architecture into the FL training process, which can effectively overcome the defects of centralized architecture. However, deploying BDFL in wireless networks usually encounters challenges, such as limited bandwidth, computing power, and energy consumption. Driven by these considerations, a dynamic stochastic optimization problem is formulated to minimize the average training delay by jointly optimizing the resource allocation and client selection under the constraints of limited energy budget and client participation. We solve the long-term mixed integer nonlinear programming problem by employing the tool of Lyapunov optimization and thereby propose the dynamic resource allocation and client scheduling BDFL (DRC-BDFL) algorithm. Furthermore, we analyse the learning performance of DRC-BDFL and derive an upper bound for convergence regarding the global loss function. Extensive experiments conducted on the SVHN and CIFAR-10 data sets demonstrate that the DRC-BDFL achieves comparable accuracy to the baseline algorithms while significantly reducing the training delay by 9.24% and 12.47%, respectively.  © 2024 IEEE.},

In this paper, we present a Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) algorithm to simultaneously schedule thousands of EVs charging and discharging operations, that can be used to provide ancillary services. To achieve scalability, the monolithic problem is decomposed using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Furthermore, we propose a method to handle bilinear constraints of the original problem inside the ADMM iterations, which changes the problem class from Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP) to Quadratic Program (QP), allowing for a substantial computational speed up. We test the algorithm using real data from the largest carsharing company in Switzerland and show how our formulation can be used to retrieve flexibility boundaries for the EV fleet.

To solve MAGVSDUT, a mixed-integer linear programming model and a discrete Jaya (DJaya) algorithm are proposed. At first, a heuristic based on ant colony algorithm is designed to generate high-quality initial solution. And then, two DJaya operators are designed, one of which is a near optimal operator updating solutions towards better solutions found, while the other is the away worst operator updating solutions towards worst solutions. In addition, a sequence insertion operator is designed to help the population find better solutions within the global space. Finally, a battery of comparative experiments is conducted in conjunction with the actual situation of an electronic equipment manufacturing company.

The aim is to adjust train schedules online according to time-dependent passenger demands so that passenger satisfaction and operational costs are jointly optimized. An extended passenger absorption model that explicitly includes time-dependent passenger origin–destination demands is developed, where the term “absorption” refers to passengers boarding trains. Then, the passenger absorption model is extended to a bi-level framework, where passenger demands and rolling stock availability are considered at the higher level, and detailed timetables and train speed profiles are included at the lower level. A bi-level model predictive control (MPC) approach is developed for the integrated problem. The optimization problems of both levels of the bi-level MPC approach can be converted into mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems, which enables us to solve them with existing MILP solvers. We then show that the recursive feasibility of both the higher-level and the lower-level optimization problems can be guaranteed. In this way, we can achieve real-time train scheduling for the metro system. Numerical experiments, based on real-life data from the Beijing metro network, illustrate the effectiveness of the extended passenger absorption model and the proposed bi-level MPC approach. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Patients are scheduled on multiple machine types considering their priority for treatment, session duration and allowed machines. Expected future arrivals of urgent patients are included in the models as placeholder patients. Since different cancer centers can have different scheduling objectives, the models are compared using multiple objective functions, including minimizing waiting times, and maximizing the fulfillment of patients’ preferences for treatment times. The test data is generated from historical data from Iridium Netwerk, Belgium’s largest cancer center with 10 linear accelerators. The results demonstrate that the CG-IP model can solve all the different problem instances to a mean optimality gap of less than 1 % within one hour. The proposed methodology provides a tool for automated scheduling of RT treatments and can be generally applied to RT centers. © 2023, The Author(s).},

For example, the conventional genetic algorithm is only suitable for solving continuous function course scheduling problems and cannot be used for discrete and constant course scheduling problems. The improved genetic algorithm has unique advantages in solving discrete and continuous combinatorial optimization problems.

	abstract = {This study develops optimal maintenance schedules for train lines, a critical endeavor ensuring the safety, efficiency, and reliability of railway networks. The study addresses the combined scheduling problem of maintenance works and crews on the railway networks. The baseline scheduling model is initially established with the primary objective of allocating maintenance tasks efficiently while adhering to pertinent constraints, encompassing task grouping and cost minimization. Subsequently, this baseline model is enhanced through the integration of crew scheduling, wherein work crews are strategically assigned to execute predefined tasks, thereby facilitating effective workload distribution. The combined maintenance work and crew scheduling problem is mathematically formulated as a binary linear programming model, enabling the attainment of globally optimal solutions. Comparing the outcomes of our enhanced model, which incorporates both maintenance works and crew schedules, with the baseline model that solely addresses maintenance works, we reveal that task grouping in accordance with predefined conditions leads to reduced overall costs by minimizing maintenance duration during various periods. Additionally, the judicious distribution of workload among the crews ensures comprehensive coverage of all essential tasks. These findings underscore the significance of our proposed approach in enhancing the operational efficacy and economic viability of railway maintenance scheduling, thereby offering valuable insights for practical implementation and future research endeavors. © 2023 by the authors.},

Therefore, it is essential to present a novel scheduling technique with high intelligence and fast decision-making capacity to realize MGs’ automatic operation and regulation. This paper proposes an optimal scheduling decision-making method for MGs based on deep neural networks (DNN). Firstly, a typical mathematical scheduling model used for MG operation is introduced, and the limitations of current methods are analyzed. Then, a two-stage optimal scheduling framework comprising day-ahead and intra-day stages is presented. The day-ahead part is solved by mixed integer linear programming (MILP), and the intra-day part uses a convolutional neural network (CNN)—bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi LSTM) for high-speed rolling decision making, with the outputs adjusted by a power correction balance algorithm. Finally, the validity of the model and algorithm of this paper are verified by arithmetic case analysis. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The increasing penetration of renewable energy and the growing frequency and severity of extreme weather events pose a significant challenge to the secure and economic operation of local energy systems. This paper presents a risk-averse scheduling model of the integrated electricity and heat system (IEHS) for resilience enhancement against contingencies. A tri-level formulation is proposed to formulate the worst line outage events and identify the optimal resilience enhancement strategies. The main idea is to find the least-cost scheduling solution that meets the predefined resilience requirements. The model incorporates multi-energy network operations that integrate network reconfiguration in the PDN and mass flow rate control in the DHN. This approach provides more flexibility for load restoration in the face of uncertainties. A nonlinear thermal flow model is adopted to realistically capture thermal dynamics, and a tractable linear approximation is then proposed to balance accuracy and tractability. To solve this tri-level mixed integer program, an efficient solution method based on the nested column-and-constraint-generation algorithm is developed for the proposed IEHS scheduling model. Numerical studies indicate that the proposed model provides optimal solutions that are cost-effective to enhance the resilience of IEHS at minimum expense. © 2023},

	abstract = {Aircraft delays lead to safety concerns and financial losses, which can propagate for several hours during extreme scenarios. Developing an efficient landing scheduling method is one of the effective approaches to reducing flight delays and safety concerns. Existing scheduling practices are mostly done by air traffic controllers (ATC) with heuristic rules. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-enhanced methodology for aircraft landing scheduling. Data-driven machine learning (ML) models are proposed to enhance automation and safety. ML enhancement is adopted for both prediction and optimization. First, the flight arrival delay scenarios are analyzed to identify the delay-related factors, where strong multimodal distributions and arrival flight time duration clusters are observed. A multi-stage conditional ML predictor is proposed for improved prediction performance of separation time conditioned on flight events. Next, we propose incorporating the ML predictions as safety constraints of the time-constrained traveling salesman problem formulation. The scheduling problem is then solved with mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Additionally, uncertainties between successive flights from historical flight recordings and model predictions are included to ensure reliability. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of our method using the flight track and event data from the Sherlock database of the Atlanta Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC ZTL). The case studies provide evidence that the proposed method is capable of reducing the total landing time by an average of 17.2% across three case studies, when compared to the First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) rule. Unlike the deterministic heuristic FCFS rule, the proposed methodology also considers the uncertainties between aircraft and ensures confidence in the scheduling. Finally, several concluding remarks and future research directions are given. The code used can be retrieved from Link. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Demand-side response (DSR) is a strategy that enables consumers to actively participate in managing electricity demand. It aims to alleviate strain on the grid during high demand and promote a more balanced and efficient use of (renewable) electricity resources. We implement DSR through discount scheduling, which involves offering discrete price incentives to consumers to adjust their electricity consumption patterns to times when their local energy mix consists of more renewable energy. Since we tailor the discounts to individual customers' consumption, the discount scheduling problem (DSP) becomes a large combinatorial optimization task. Consequently, we adopt a hybrid quantum computing approach, using D-Wave's Leap Hybrid Cloud. We benchmark Leap against Gurobi, a classical mixed-integer optimizer, in terms of solution quality at fixed runtime and fairness in terms of discount allocation. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale decomposition algorithm/heuristic for the DSP, applied with either quantum or classical computers running the subroutines, which significantly reduces the problem size while maintaining solution quality. Using synthetic data generated from real-world data, we observe that the classical decomposition method obtains the best overall solution quality for problem sizes up to 3200 consumers; however, the hybrid quantum approach provides more evenly distributed discounts across consumers. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To reduce human resource costs, the part-to-picker order fulfilment systems may have a single picker in charge of multiple workstations. And the picking speed of the picker becomes faster as the picking number increases due to the learning effect in the picking operation. In this paper, the scheduling problem to optimizing picking sequence of the picker is presented to minimize the maximum picking time, where one picker is responsible for multiple workstations. The learning effect and travel time between workstations are taken into account to improve scheduling accuracy. Two mixed integer programming (MIP) models are proposed to solve the problem, namely the rank-based model and disjunctive model. The performance of the two Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) models has been evaluated, and it has been found that they are only capable of solving small-scale problems. The rank-based model is limited to solving problems with up to 9 groups, whereas the disjunctive model can handle up to 20 groups. Therefore, the disjunctive model outperforms the rank-based model. Moreover, this paper proposes Interval Insertion NEH (IINEH) and iterative greedy (IG) algorithm to solve the large-scale problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the two methods to solve the problem, where IINEH operates faster while IG gives better results. Therefore, when faced with a large-scale problem, IINEH is recommended if a quick solution is needed. If better optimization results are needed, the decision maker can choose IG. © The authors.

Considering the diverse ownership of microgrids, distributed energy resources (DERs) that interface directly with utilities and responsive loads, an alternating direction method of multipliers–based distributed framework was formulated for the scheduling of networked microgrids embedded modern distribution systems by adjusting nodal price signals iteratively. In addition, to make the formulated optimization problems resolvable through more accessible and popular MILP solvers, different linearisation techniques were employed to transform the nonlinear terms into linear or mixed integer linear formats. The proposed MILP-based distributed method preserves all participants' autonomy (e.g., microgrids, DERs that interface directly with utilities and responsive loads), while incentivising them to actively participate in the distribution system operation with price signals. The proposed method is validated with results of numerical simulation using a modern distribution system consisting of multiple networked microgrids, DERs that interface directly with utilities, as well as responsive loads.

	abstract = {The trips of a high-frequency urban rail line are typically planned with the aim of achieving even time headways. This results in reliable services for each urban rail line, where successive trips have the same time headway. Maintaining even time headways for each service line has significant advantages for the passengers of the line, but it might result in safety issues, vehicle bunching, and increased transfer times at a common corridor served by multiple urban rail lines. This study investigates the problem of urban rail corridor coordination and develops an exact optimization method for coordinating the vehicle trips of different lines that serve stations along a joint corridor. The proposed formulation is a non-convex mathematical program which is reformulated as a mixed-integer quadratic program with a convex objective function. A branch-and-bound algorithm coupled with the Active-set method is proposed for solving the model to global optimality. Results from a toy network and a case study of the light rail service in The Hague, The Netherlands, demonstrate the improvement potential of time headways at a common corridor, while accounting for the effect on the variation of time headways at isolated segments of the individual service lines. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {With the dense deployment of the satellite constellations, spectrum sharing among multiple satellite communication systems is a feasible way to alleviate the scarcity of spectrum resources. In order to improve the spectrum efficiency, we investigate the resource allocation in the spectrum sharing scenario of multiple beam-hopping (BH)-based satellite systems. The BH technology enhances the scheduling flexibility and the reusability of the transmission resources, but it also makes the inter-system interference more complicated. Under the interference constraint, the resource allocation problem is formulated to maximize the throughput of the satellite system. Based on the set of feasible beam allocation patterns, the optimization problem is reformulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem to obtain the optimal solution. A greedy suboptimal algorithm is also proposed to solve the problem with low complexity. To further accelerate the resource allocation process, the inter-beam distance threshold is introduced to reduce the number of feasible beam allocation patterns. Simulation results show that the proposed resource allocation algorithms achieve higher system throughput and better adaptability to the uneven distribution of traffic demands. It is also shown that the suboptimal algorithm achieves desirable performance with lower computational complexity, which is more attractive for the real-time resource allocation in the satellite systems. © 2024 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Electric vehicle (EV) drivers aim to charge their vehicles cost-effectively and with minimal charging time. Meanwhile, the ever-increasing number of EVs without charging control strategies could result in a massive surge in peak demand, potentially overloading distribution equipment and violating voltage constraints. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces a transactive energy market (TEM) framework for an EV parking lot (EVPL) equipped with photovoltaic (PV) panels and battery systems (BSs), considering the preferences of both EV drivers and the EVPL operator. In this framework, EVs parked in the EVPL participate in the TEM by submitting their charging flexibility through response curves, which indicate the compensation required for different values of flexibility. Furthermore, the proposed model allows the EVPL operator to utilize the flexibility of EVs in the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) program by incentivizing EV drivers, considering their preferences and the degradation cost of EV batteries. The study employs the stochastic programming method to model uncertainties in PV output, electricity prices, and EV availability. It also incorporates BS degradation costs and carbon emissions constraints into the EVPL scheduling problem. Linearization techniques are then applied to transform the non-linear optimization problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. Finally, applying the model to a case study validates its superiority in satisfying the preferences of both EV drivers and EVPL. © 2024 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Inland waterway transportation plays a pivotal role in advancing economic development and nurturing sustainable progress. It serves as a vital conduit linking communities, industries, and markets, thereby facilitating the seamless flow of essential commodities and fostering regional integration. However, in today’s era, marked by a resolute commitment to environmental responsibility and sustainability, inland shipping confronts formidable challenges, particularly pertaining to emission pollution and the escalating costs of fuel. These challenges represent significant impediments to the pursuit of environmentally conscious and sustainable growth by shipping companies. This research endeavor is geared towards the creation of a mathematical model that takes into account various factors, including the types of waterways, temporal constraints, and punctual arrival at the port of discharge. The primary objective is to empower shipping companies to make informed decisions about optimal sailing speeds and the most opportune time windows for entering one-way waterway segments. This, in turn, leads to reductions in fuel costs and waiting times for shipping companies, all while achieving cost minimization and mitigating emissions issues in inland waterway transportation. Ultimately, this research advances the cause of green and sustainable development in the inland waterway shipping sector. Specifically, this study focuses on routes that involve the dynamic transition between one-way and two-way segments. To accomplish this, an integer programming (IP) model is proposed to meticulously analyze the ideal sailing speed for each segment of the route and determine the optimal windows for accessing single-direction channels, thus representing a multistage decision-making process. Meanwhile, the model’s reliability is substantiated through a rigorous comparative assessment against three benchmark strategies (EAS, LAS, and MAS). In our experiments, the optimization model yielded a total cost for the entire inland waterway amounting to $80,626.20. This figure stands below the total costs of $87,118.14 under the EAS strategy and $83,494.70 under the MAS strategy (the LAS strategy failed to meet the port of discharge deadline), thereby conclusively validating its ability to guide vessels to their port of discharge within prescribed schedules, all while reducing overall operational costs and promoting sustainable and environmentally responsible practices. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Currently, island grids are being rapidly constructed in various regions, and the stochastic nature of renewable energy generation output provides a great challenge for the economic dispatch of island grids. In terms of demand-side management, the models used in existing studies in considering time-of-use pricing as well as interruptible loads are still relatively simple, which makes it difficult to fully utilize their potentials in scenarios where the number and types of controllable loads in the distribution network are increasing. For this reason, this paper firstly analyzes the time response characteristics of users participating in interruptible load protocols. Moreover, this paper proposes corresponding time-domain compensation means, and establishes a multi-type active load model based on time-of-use pricing. Secondly, the time-of-use pricing setting and the optimal scheduling of the active distribution network are integrated into a unified optimization problem in order to strengthen the guiding effect of the time-of-use pricing mechanism on the users and to achieve the overall economic optimization. Finally, a mixed integer nonlinear programming model for day-ahead and intraday integrated scheduling is developed to consider the source-storage-load characteristics within the distribution grid. Compared with the constant tariff model and the traditional TOU model, the co-optimization method of time-of-use pricing formulation and active distribution grid dispatch are improved in terms of economic efficiency of the island grid.  © 2013 IEEE.},

To manage the intricacy of model M1, a knapsack problem reformulation is employed to establish a simplified binary integer programming model (M2). Both M1 and M2 are subsequently converted into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) models to harness the potential of quantum computing. Several techniques, including the Gurobi solver, simulated annealing, and the coherent Ising machine (CIM) quantum simulator, are deployed to solve the model across four distinct scenarios of varying complexity. The findings indicate that CIM quantum simulator outperforms the simulated annealing method in terms of solution quality for medium-scale problems. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Different experiments were conducted, and the results show that the level of skill achieved is highly sensitive to the number of assistants and the number of allocations. The experiments also showed that, while keeping the same number of lab assistants, it is possible to include flexibility and welfare constraints.

	abstract = {Digital twins technology is a key pillar to realizing the vision of Industrial Metaverse and enabling Industry 5.0 where industries become more sustainable, resilient, and smart, while being human-centric. In this paper we aim at developing a high fidelity digital twin model consistent with its physical system for better informed decisions in terms of failure avoidance or performance enhancements. To enable this, we harness the capabilities of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to collect measurement data from Industrial Internet of Things devices that monitor various independent physical entities in a given industrial plant. Each device sends its readings to the UAV that in turn performs computations to determine the status of the physical entities. The UAV relays the resulting status details to the digital twin running at the edge of the network in a timely manner. For a high fidelity digital twin, the processed status has to be kept as close as possible to the actual status of the physical entities through ensuring high accuracy and synchronization. To do so, we introduce the age of digital twin metric based on the age of information concept to represent the degree of synchronization between the digital and physical twins then formulate the problem as a mixed integer non-convex program. Due to its complexity, we decompose the problem into two subproblems, convexify their constraints and optimize the UAV trajectory, device scheduling, wireless and computing resource allocation, and data collection. We run extensive simulations for various system parameters and demonstrate the resulting accuracy of the digital twin model while ensuring high synchronization. Simulation results corroborate the superiority of our proposed solution as compared to different baseline approaches.  © 2013 IEEE.},

The paper proposes a real-time two-time-scale voltage regulation method with soft open point (SOP) to solve the reactive power optimization problem. To obtain hourly scheduling strategies for on-load tap changers and switchable capacitor banks, the centralized optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer second-order cone programming in the first stage. In the second stage, the active distribution system is divided into multiple subsystems according to the proposed partitioning method, and the SOP is regulated to adjust the voltage in real-time through an effective control strategy and local measurement information of the subsystems. The proposed method takes full account of the randomness of photovoltaic, and can conduct distributed real-time voltage regulation in the active distribution system based on the rapid and continuous response of SOP. Compared with traditional methods, this method has lower communication costs, better real-time performance, and does not dependent on an accurate power flow model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 123-bus simulation examples. © 2023},

Geometry sizes of textile products, non-identical capacities of packing machines, and the capacity of the needle detector are addressed in parallel-batching modes. To make batching and sequencing decisions simultaneously, a mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) is formulated. Then, a matheuristic method, Tabu Search with Fixing and Optimization (TSFO), is developed. Using tabu search to determine which variables to be fixed, the MILP is solved through a fix-and-optimize process. The results of extensive computational experiments show that the TSFO yields better solutions within much less computation time than solving the model directly in a commercial solver. Furthermore, the TSFO also outperforms an existing method in a special case from literature. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The healthcare industry has recently faced the issues of enhancing patient care, streamlining healthcare operations, and offering high-quality services at reasonable costs. These crucial issues include general healthcare administration, resource allocation, staffing, patient care priorities, and effective scheduling. Therefore, efficient staff scheduling, resource allocation, and patient assignments are required to address these challenges. To address these challenges, in this paper, we developed a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model employing the Gurobi optimization solver. The model includes staff assignments, patient assignments, resource allocations, and overtime hours to minimize healthcare expenditures and enhance patient care. We experimented with the robustness and flexibility of our model by implementing two distinct scenarios, each resulting in two unique optimal solutions. The first experimental procedure yielded an optimal solution with an objective value of 844.0, with an exact match between the best-bound score and the objective value, indicating a 0.0% solution gap. Similarly, the second one produced an optimal solution with an objective value of 539.0. The perfect match between this scenario’s best-bound score and objective value resulted in a 0.0% solution gap, further affirming the model’s reliability. The best-bound scores indicated no significant differences in these two procedures, demonstrating that the solutions were ideal within the allowed tolerances. © 2023 by the authors.},

In this letter, we propose an energy-efficient task offloading scheme for VEC system with one-by-one scheduling mechanism, where only one vehicle wakes up at a time to offload with a road side unit (RSU). The goal of the system is to minimize the total energy consumption of vehicles by jointly optimizing user scheduling, offloading ratio, and bit allocation within a given mission time. To this end, the mixed-integer and non-convex optimization problem is formulated and solved by adopting Lagrange dual problem.

In order to achieve higher network capacity with limited resources and meet the quality of service (QoS) requirements of more users in the integrated mmWave access and terahertz backhaul network, this article formulates a problem of maximizing the number of users successfully served in both the access and backhaul links. Since the problem is a non-linear integer optimization problem, a minimum rate ratio user association and transmission scheduling algorithm is proposed to obtain a suboptimal solution. The proposed algorithm takes the minimum rate ratio as the user association criterion and schedules first the users with fewer backhaul transmission slots. In addition, the algorithm will update the number of access transmission slots allocated to users and the access scheduling results after the backhaul scheduling phase. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms several benchmark algorithms in terms of the number of served users and system throughput, and it can cope with a large number of bursty user requests. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

However, no-shows can significantly disrupt this process and affect patient care. To address this challenge, healthcare facilities can adopt different strategies, including overbooking in medical consultations. While this reduces the risk of unused slots, it can generate associated costs and affect the perception of service quality. In this article, we propose an integer linear optimization model that maximizes the expected utility of a medical center, considering the risk of no-shows and overbooking. For this purpose, machine learning is used to estimate the propensity of each patient to attend their medical appointment, using real data from three medical specialties of a hospital. The results of the application demonstrate the model's ability to assign appointments and perform overbooking efficiently and in an organized manner, implying an improvement in the utility of a medical center and a positive impact on the perception of the quality of care.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The ongoing transition of the energy system towards being low-carbon, digitized and distributed is accelerating. Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) are playing a major role in this transition. These DERs can be aggregated and controlled by Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) to participate in energy markets and make full use of the potential of DERs. Many existing VPP models solely focus on the financial impact of aggregating DERs and do not consider the technical limitations of the distribution system. This may result in technically unfeasible solutions to DERs operations. This paper presents an expanded VPP model, termed the Technical Virtual Power Plant (TVPP), which explicitly considers the technical constraints of the network to provide operating schedules that are both economically beneficial to the DERs and technically feasible. The TVPP model is formulated as a bi-level stochastic mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model. Two objective functions are used, the upper level focuses on minimizing the amount of power imported into the TVPP from the external grid, while the lower level is concerned with optimally scheduling a mixture of DERs to increase the profit of the TVPP operator. The model considers three TVPPs and allows for energy trading among the TVPPs. The model is applied to several case studies based on the IEEE 119-node test system. Results show improved DERs operating schedules, improved system reliability and an increase in demand response engagement. Finally, energy trading among the TVPP is shown to further reduce the costs of the TVPP and power imported from the upstream electrical network. © 2023 The Authors},

This research differs from previous studies in several aspects. Firstly, it is considered three different objectives: total tardiness, total number of washes (sequence-dependent setups), and total machine fixed cost. These objectives have not been simultaneously optimized in previous studies, making our approach unique. Secondly, we adopt a lexicographic optimization approach to prioritize these objectives according to the company's requirements. This allows to find solutions that are optimal in terms of one objective while satisfying the constraints imposed by the other objectives. Lastly, it is proposed a novel lexicographic multi-objective genetic algorithm, which extends the traditional single-objective genetic algorithm, to effectively solve large-sized problems. Overall, our study not only addresses a real-life problem in the textile industry but also introduces innovative techniques and approaches for optimizing multiple objectives in a scheduling context. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Moreover, the dynamic emergence of patients needing urgent care during the day should be handled by rescheduling these patients. In this article, we present a reoptimization framework for this dynamic problem to periodically determine which patients will be visited in which order on each day to maximize the total priority of visited patients and to minimize the overtime for the health-care provider. This optimization framework also aims to minimize total routing time. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is formulated and solved at predetermined reoptimization times, to assure that urgent patients are visited within the current day, while visits of others may be postponed, if overtime is not desired or limited. The effectiveness of a schedule is evaluated with respect to several performance metrics, such as the number of patients whose visits are postponed to the next day, waiting time of urgent patients, and required overtime. The MIP-based approach is compared to two practical heuristics that achieve satisfactory performance under a nervous service system by excelling in different criteria. The MIP-based reoptimization approach is demonstrated for a case during the COVID-19 pandemic. We contribute to the home health-care literature by managing dynamic/urgent patient arrivals under a multiperiod setting with prioritized patients, where we optimize different rescheduling objectives via three alternative reoptimization approaches.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the growth of globalized trade, the efficient operation of airports is crucial. In this paper, we study the use of digital twin technology to optimize the yard resources of airports, which can improve their operational efficiency and decision-making quality. The study first constructs a digital twin framework for intelligent yard scheduling, which contains physical and virtual space and the connection between them. Data is collected through the physical perception module, while the virtual space is used for real-time simulation and optimized decision-making. The research methodology includes mixed integer programming and adaptive immune cloning algorithms for optimizing yard resource allocation and box space allocation. The experimental results show that the method can effectively reduce the total transportation distance in the air terminal yard operation and improve operation efficiency. The experiments demonstrate an average improvement in operational efficiency of around 20% and a cost reduction of around 15%. It is concluded that digital twin technology has apparent advantages in allocating resources in air terminal yards, which can achieve efficient utilization of resources and dynamic optimization of decision-making.  © 2024 Yicheng Qiu, published by Sciendo.},

A power control center orchestrates the microgrid, coordinating distributed energy resources (DERs) for peak demand fulfillment and excess energy utilization. We propose a proportional-integral control system for efficient demand response, achieving reduced post-scheduling costs and a peak-to-average ratio. Comparative analysis reveals Ant Colony Optimization outperforms Binary Particle Swarm Optimization in cost and peak-to-average ratio reduction. Simulations explore two scenarios: Case 1 integrates with the main grid for reliability, while Case 2 utilizes solely renewable energy sources. Although Case 2 exhibits superior performance, Case 1's dependence on the main grid offers greater real-world feasibility. Therefore, Case 1 with optimized DER scheduling emerges as the recommended solution for enhancing microgrid efficiency and ensuring reliable power supply in smart homes.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recently, time-sensitive services have expanded from traditional industrial control systems to more scenarios. Some time-sensitive applications, such as remote surgery, autonomous driving, augmented reality (AR), etc., require deterministic end-to-end delay and jitter in data transmission. deterministic network (DetNet) is proposed as a promising technology for providing deterministic service in wide area networks (WAN). DetNet guarantees deterministic end-to-end delay and jitter by specifying a certain routing path and transmission time-slots for time-sensitive flows. However, how to efficiently steer time-sensitive flows while jointly allocating transmission time-slots is still an open problem. Existing flow scheduling algorithms are limited in the scenarios of local area networks (LAN), and do not consider the impact of propagation delay in large-scale networks. To this end, we study the joint optimization of time-slot allocation and traffic steering, while considering the propagation delay of WAN links. Our objective is to maximize the number of successfully deployed time-sensitive flows under the constraints of required end-to-end delay. Accordingly, we formulate the studied problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) model. Since it is proved to be an NP-hard problem, we design a heuristic algorithm named genetic-based deterministic network traffic scheduling (GDNTS). The solution with the largest number of deployed time-sensitive flows can be obtained from the evolution of chromosomes in GDNTS. Compared with the benchmark algorithms, extensive simulation results show that GDNTS improves the deployed time sensitive-flows number by 22.85% in average. © 2023 KICS.},

In our case, each machine requires a certain setup time to process all the different jobs assigned to it. Hence, this setup time will be independent of sequence of jobs, but will depend only on the nature of machine. The optimization objective is to minimize the maximum tardiness criterion. To solve this optimization problem, an exact method, heuristics and metaheuristics are the three main resolution methods that we have used. The exact method is represented by the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. In terms of the second category of resolution methods, we have been focused on two methods, the first is a modified heuristic based on Johnson rule (HBJR) while the second is based on the Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) algorithm. Finally, three metaheuristics have been used, namely the iterated local search (ILS) method, the iterated greedy (IG) algorithm and the genetic algorithm (GA). Our numerical results indicate that for the problems with small size instances, the NEH heuristic outperforms HBJR approach, while for relatively large size instances, the developed IG algorithm gives best results than both other metaheuristics ILS and GA.  © The authors.},

	abstract = {Drive-by sensing (i.e. vehicle-based mobile sensing) is an emerging data collection paradigm that leverages vehicle mobilities to scan a city at low costs. It represents a positive social externality of urban transport activities. Bus transit systems are widely considered in drive-by sensing due to extensive spatial coverage, reliable operations, and low maintenance costs. It is critical for the underlying monitoring scenario (e.g. air quality, traffic state, and road roughness) to assign a limited number of sensors to a bus fleet to ensure their optimal spatial–temporal distribution. In this paper we present a trip-based sensor deployment problem, which explicitly considers timetabled trips that must be executed by the fleet while a portion of them perform sensing tasks. To address the computational challenge in large-scale instances, we design a multi-stage solution framework that decouples the spatial–temporal structures of the sensing task through line pre-selection and bi-level optimization. As a result, the computational complexity is reduced to be sub-linear w.r.t. the number of lines, rather than combinatorial w.r.t. the number of buses in existing vehicle-based approaches. A real-world case study covering 400 km2 in central Chengdu demonstrates the effectiveness of the model in solving large-scale problems. It is found that coordinating bus scheduling and sensing tasks can substantially increase the spatial–temporal sensing coverage. We also provide a few model extensions and recommendation for practice regarding the application of this method. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

However, the existing studies in this area almost focus on human-driven vehicles which face some striking limitations (e.g., restricted crew scheduling and fixed vehicle capacity) and can weaken the overall benefits. This paper proposes a two-phase optimization procedure to fully unleash the potential of MAEVs by leveraging the strengths of MAEVs, including automatic allocation and charging of modules. In the first phase, a mixed integer programming model is established in the space-time-state framework to jointly optimize the MAEV routing and charging, passenger-to-vehicle assignment and vehicle capacity management for reserved passengers. A Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is developed to solve the model efficiently. In the second phase, three dispatching strategies are designed and optimized by a dynamic dispatching procedure to properly adapt the operation of MAEVs to emerging travel demands. A case study conducted on a major urban area of Beijing, China, demonstrates the high efficiency of the MAEV adoption in terms of resource utilization and environmental friendliness across a range of travel demand distributions, vehicle supply and module capacity scenarios.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Decision-dependent (endogenous) uncertainties (DDUs), as a new type of uncertainties revealed recently, couple dispatch decisions with uncertainty parameters and thus render power system dispatch more challenging. However, most previous works handled various DDUs via stochastic programming (SP) or robust optimization (RO) in a two-stage framework, which undoubtedly introduces the drawbacks of SP and RO, and cannot meet the nonanticipativity requirements in power scheduling. In this paper, a multistage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) method for generation dispatch with demand response (DR) is proposed considering the DDUs of deferrable loads and the decision-independent (exogenous) uncertainties (DIUs) of wind power and regular loads. By analyzing the structure of decision-dependency parameters, a novel data-driven decision-dependent ambiguity set is proposed, which provides a generic framework for formulating DDUs and DIUs simultaneously. Then a multistage DRO model with nested max-min structure is developed to integrate the merits of DRO and nonanticipativity into generation dispatch. The proposed model is solved by tailored reformulation method and improved stochastic dual dynamic integer programming (SDDiP). Case studies illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing with the multistage SP, RO, and decision-independent DRO methods. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {The widespread adoption of EVs brings practical interest to the operation optimization of the charging station. This paper considers the joint scheduling of pricing and charging control to enhance the operational capability of the station. The following contributions are made. First, a joint scheduling model of pricing and charging control is developed to maximize the expected social welfare of the charging station considering the quality of service and the price fluctuation sensitivity of EV drivers. It is formulated as a Markov decision process with a variance criterion to capture uncertainties during operation. Second, a two-phase on-line policy learning algorithm is proposed to solve this joint scheduling problem. In the first phase, it implements event-based policy iteration to find the optimal pricing scheme. In the second phase, it implements scenario-based model predictive control for smart charging under the updated pricing scheme. Third, by leveraging the performance difference theory, the optimality of the proposed algorithm is theoretically analyzed. The feasibility of the proposed method and the improved social welfare of the charging station are numerically demonstrated based on a typical charging station with distributed generation and storage. Note to Practitioners - The popularization of EVs requires the high-efficiency operation of the charging station. The joint scheduling of pricing and charging control can provide a promising way to achieve the balance between EV drivers' satisfaction and the profit maximization of the charging station. However, it suffers from EV drivers' uncertain responses to the pricing scheme and the coupled relationship between pricing and charging control. This multi-stage stochastic programming is non-trivial to solve. In this paper, we propose a two-phase on-line policy learning method for this joint scheduling problem. This algorithm can be implemented in the controller of the charging station. In the first phase, the event-based policy iteration can be implemented to iteratively improve the current best pricing scheme until convergence. In the second phase, the scenario-based model predictive control, which is reformulated as a mixed integer linear programming, can be quickly solved for smart charging. Case studies demonstrate the operation enhancement of the station.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

Our objective is to simultaneous plan the industrial production and the energy supply in this site so as to minimise the total cost. A new way of modelling this combinatorial optimisation problem is proposed: it relies on the extension of a multi-product single-resource small-bucket lot-sizing model called the proportional lot-sizing and scheduling problem. This extension involves among others sequence-dependent changeover times overlapping multiple periods and energy-related constraints. Our numerical results show that the resulting mixed-integer linear programming model enables to obtain good-quality production and energy supply plans with a computational effort much smaller than the one required by a previously published large-bucket lot-sizing model. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The traditional hierarchical scheduling and operational model of transmission and distribution networks has failed to fully utilize the adjustable resources of the entire grid, consequently limiting the integration of renewable energy. To fully excavate the potential of transmission and distribution (T&D) coordination in enhancing the level of renewable energy assimilation and operational efficiency, in this paper, transmission grid and distribution network in the framework of synergetic unit commitment (TDS-UC) considering the dynamic characteristics of the electricity-gas-heat integrated energy system is proposed. The framework developed in this paper allows for the integration of multiple energy sources, including electricity, gas, and heat, into the dispatch strategy of the TG. To improve scheduling flexibility, the dynamic characteristics of the natural gas and heating networks are also considered in the TDS-UC model. A coordinated interactive optimization model for T&D is formulated, taking into account the multi-energy coupling relationship of the IES. To solve the TDS-UC model, a decentralized analytical target cascading algorithm is used to obtain an independent TG optimization problem and multiple ADNs local optimization problems that can be solved in parallel. The proposed model is transformed into an easy-to-solve mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem using an improved one-dimensional approximation piecewise linearization method to deal with the non-convexity nonlinear natural gas Weymouth equation. Numerical experiments are conducted on both a T6D2 and a T118D10 test system to demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of the proposed methodology. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This paper investigates the optimization problem of scheduling strategies for AMRs at smart hospitals, where the service and travel times of AMRs are stochastic. A stochastic mixed-integer programming model is formulated to minimize the total cost of the hospital by reducing the number of AMRs and travel distance while satisfying constraints such as AMR battery state of charge, AMR capacity, and time windows for medical requests. To address this objective, some properties of the solutions with time window constraints are identified. The variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm is adjusted by incorporating the properties of the AMR scheduling problem to solve the model. Experimental results demonstrate that VNS generates high-quality solutions. Both enhanced efficiency and the meeting of medical demands are achieved through intelligently arranging the driving routes of AMRs for both charging and service requests, resulting in substantial cost reductions for hospitals and enhanced utilization of medical resources. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In this study, the problem of scheduling a set of jobs and one uncertain maintenance activity on a single machine, with the objective of minimizing the makespan is addressed. The maintenance activity has a given duration and must be executed within a given time window. Furthermore, duration and time window of the maintenance are uncertain, and can take different values which can be described by different scenarios. The problem is to determine a job sequence which performs well, in terms of makespan, independently on the possible variation of the data concerning the maintenance. A robust scheduling approach is used for the problem, in which four different measures of robustness are considered, namely, maximum absolute regret, maximum relative regret, worst-case scenario, and ordered weighted averaging. Complexity and approximation results are presented. In particular, we show that, for all the four robustness criteria, the problem is strongly NP-hard. A number of special cases are explored, and an exact pseudopolynomial algorithm based on dynamic programming is devised when the number of scenarios is fixed. Two Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) models are also presented for the general problem. Several computational experiments have been conducted to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the MIP models and of the dynamic programming approach. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Transfer optimization in public transport (PT) networks can be achieved through coordinated timetabling and vehicle scheduling. Traditionally, the coordinated timetabling problem is solved first before proceeding to the vehicle scheduling problem. The integration of these two problems can help further reduce the total operation cost and improve the level of service, especially when timetables of different PT lines are well-coordinated at transfer stations. This work addresses the integrated PT timetable coordination and vehicle scheduling problem while ensuring that each PT line is dispatched with an even headway. We first separately formulate two integer linear programming models for the timetable coordination and vehicle scheduling problems. Next, the two models are integrated into a bi-objective integer linear programming model for the integrated timetable coordination and vehicle scheduling problem. For small size PT networks, the model can be solved by using an ɛ-constraint method, together with off-the-shelf optimization solvers. For large-size problems, two constraint-reduction procedures are developed to reduce the number of redundant constraints so as to reduce the computation complexity and improve the solution process. Finally, the models and solution method are applied to a numerical example and a real-world bus rapid transit (BRT) network in Chengdu, China. Computation results show that the solution generated by the sequential optimization approach is usually dominated by the Pareto-optimal solutions generated by the integrated optimization approach. Our findings suggest that it is not a wise decision to use the solution generated by the sequential optimization approach or the solution with the minimum fleet size generated by the integrated optimization approach. For practical implementation, it is recommended to choose the solution that has a fleet size of one more vehicle than the minimum fleet size. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {A coordinated scheduling model based on two-stage distributionally robust optimization (TSDRO) is proposed for integrated energy systems (IESs) with electricity-hydrogen hybrid energy storage. The scheduling problem of the IES is divided into two stages in the TSDRO-based coordinated scheduling model. The first stage addresses the day-ahead optimal scheduling problem of the IES under deterministic forecasting information, while the second stage uses a distributionally robust optimization method to determine the intraday rescheduling problem under high-order uncertainties, building upon the results of the first stage. The scheduling model also considers collaboration among the electricity, thermal, and gas networks, focusing on economic operation and carbon emissions. The flexibility of these networks and the energy gradient utilization of hydrogen units during operation are also incorporated into the model. To improve computational efficiency, the nonlinear formulations in the TSDRO-based coordinated scheduling model are properly linearized to obtain a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model. The Column-Constraint Generation (C&CG) algorithm is then employed to decompose the scheduling model into a master problem and subproblems. Through the iterative solution of the master problem and subproblems, an efficient analysis of the coordinated scheduling model is achieved. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed TSDRO-based coordinated scheduling model is verified through case studies. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TSDRO-based coordinated scheduling model can effectively accomplish the optimal scheduling task while considering the uncertainty and flexibility of the system. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed TSDRO-based coordinated scheduling model can better balance conservativeness and robustness. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Such capability is especially important for the application of smart cities as it increases wireless service offers and quality to end-users. In this paper, we aim to maximize the number of served users in a challenging RIS-Aided smart city street by jointly optimizing the multislot scheduling, precoding, and passive RIS-based beamforming design under quality of service and power constraints. Multislot scheduling is introduced in order to benefit from additional time diversity and thus better exploit the available degrees of freedom. The formulated problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming, which is NP-hard. To solve the problem with affordable complexity, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm based on binary variable relaxation, alternating optimization, and successive convex approximation techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed design over the design without RIS and the design without scheduling, especially in the presence of a large number of users. In addition, results illustrate that by introducing a quality of service margin, the proposed design can improve its robustness to outdated channel state information in mobility scenarios.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

In EV-MEC, a fundamental problem is to jointly decide the charging power of EVs and computation task allocation to EVs, for meeting both the diverse charging demands of EVs and stringent performance requirements of heterogeneous tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a new joint charging scheduling and computation offloading scheme (OCEAN) for EV-MEC. Specifically, we formulate a cooperative two-timescale optimization problem to minimize the charging load and its variance subject to the performance requirements of computation tasks. We then decompose this sophisticated optimization problem into two sub-problems: charging scheduling and computation offloading. For the former, we develop a novel safe deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, and theoretically prove the feasibility of learned charging scheduling policy. For the latter, we reformulate it as an integer non-linear programming problem to derive the optimal offloading decisions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that OCEAN can achieve similar performances as the optimal strategy and realize up to 24% improvement in charging load variance over three state-of-the-art algorithms while satisfying the charging demands of all EVs. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The optimal scheduling of the active distribution network (ADN) is increasingly challenging due to the rising risk of ADN operation and the growth of user-side flexible resources, driven by clean energy and home device popularization. The method proposed in this paper utilizes network-side and user-side flexible resources to lower operating costs and raise system performance levels under the consideration of grid demand and user demand. In this study, mathematical models of the soft open point (SOP) and electric water heater were first constructed, and the optimal power flow model of the ADN with dynamic network reconfiguration (DNR) was established. By utilizing second-order cone relaxation (SOCR), the original mixed integer nonlinear problem (MINLP) is converted into mixed-integer second-order cone problem (MISOCP). Finally, considering the privacy of user information, a distributed optimization method for ADN integrated with SOPs and user side flexible resources is proposed based on the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). An IEEE 33 bus system is used to confirm the viability of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed method can lower the operating cost of the ADN, improve the system voltage quality, and improve system performance. © 2024 The Author(s).

The techno-economic dispatch model is formulated as a mixed-integer optimization problem.

The combination of renewable energy and pumped hydro energy storage reduces energy dependence by decreasing energy costs by 27 % compared with a system without storage to satisfy the required electricity demand.

	abstract = {As the aging population grows, the demand for long-term continuously Attended Home Healthcare (AHH) services has increased significantly in recent years. AHH services are beneficial since they not only alleviate the pressure on hospital resources, but also provide more convenient care for patients. However, how to reasonably assign patients to doctors and arrange their visiting sequences is still a challenging task due to various complex factors such as heterogeneous doctors, skill-matching requirements, continuity of care, and uncertain travel and service times. Motivated by a practical problem faced by an AHH service provider, we investigate a deterministic continuity-skill-restricted scheduling and routing problem (CSRP) and its stochastic variant (SCSRP) to address these operational challenges. The problem is formulated as a heterogeneous site-dependent and consistent vehicle routing problem with time windows. However, there is not a compact model and a practically implementable exact algorithm in the literature to solve such a complicated problem. To fill this gap, we propose a branch-price-and-cut algorithm to solve the CSRP and a discrete-approximation-method adaption for the SCSRP. Extensive numerical experiments and a real case study verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms and provide managerial insights for AHH service providers to achieve better performance. © Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Co-optimizing energy and water resources in a microgrid can increase efficiency and improve economic performance. Energy-water storage (EWS) devices are crucial components of a high-efficient energy-water microgrid (EWMG). The state of charge (SoC) at the end of the first day of operation is one of the most significant variables in EWS devices since it is used as a parameter to indicate the starting SoC for the second day, which influences the operating cost for the second day. Hence, this paper examines the benefits and applicability of a look-ahead optimization strategy for an EWMG integrated with multi-type energy conversion technologies and multi-energy demand response to supply various energy-water demands related to electric/hydrogen vehicles and commercial/residential buildings with the lowest cost for two consecutive days. In addition, a hybrid info-gap/robust optimization technique is applied to cover uncertainties in photovoltaic power and electricity prices as a tri-level optimization framework without generating scenarios and using the probability distribution functions. Duality theory is also used to convert the problem into a single-level MILP so that it can be solved by CPLEX. According to the findings, the implemented energy-water storage systems and look-ahead strategy accounted for, respectively, 4.03% and 0.43% reduction in the total cost. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Within microgrids (MGs), the integration of renewable energy resources (RERs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), combined heat and power (CHP) systems, demand response (DR) initiatives, and energy storage solutions poses intricate scheduling challenges. Coordinating these diverse components is pivotal for optimizing MG performance. This study presents an innovative stochastic framework to streamline energy management in MGs, covering proton exchange membrane fuel cell–CHP (PEMFC-CHP) units, RERs, PHEVs, and various storage methods. To tackle uncertainties in PHEV and RER models, we employ the robust Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) technique. Challenges related to hydrogen storage strategies in PEMFC-CHP units are addressed through a customized mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) approach. The integration of intelligent charging protocols governing PHEV charging dynamics is emphasized. Our primary goal centers on maximizing market profits, serving as the foundation for our optimization endeavors. At the heart of our approach is the Meerkat Optimization Algorithm (MOA), unraveling optimal MG operation amidst the intermittent nature of uncertain parameters. To amplify its exploratory capabilities and expedite global optima discovery, we enhance the MOA algorithm. The revised summary commences by outlining the overall goal and core algorithm, followed by a detailed explanation of optimization points for each MG component. Rigorous validation is executed using a conventional test system across diverse planning horizons. A comprehensive comparative analysis spanning varied scenarios establishes our proposed method as a benchmark against existing alternatives. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is considered one of the most promising solutions to address real-time scheduling in in-vehicle network due to its capabilities for providing deterministic service. The TSN working group proposed various traffic shaping mechanisms, while deterministic scheduling of hybrid traffic is still not effectively solved since the traffic requirements are difficult to satisfy by standalone or combined mechanisms with fixed time slot divisions. This article presents a time-aware multi-cyclicqueuing and forwarding scheduling model, that integrates the no-wait enabled time-aware shaper and multi-cyclic queuing and forwarding shaping models. Then, a scheduling solution, dubbed “TSN scheduling optimizer” (TSO) is proposed that combines optimization methods and incremental techniques. TSO aims to balance the load to maximize flow schedulability while guaranteeing the service requirements of hybrid traffic. Simulation evaluations through OMNeT++ provide a performance assessment of this proposed scheduling model, which can satisfy multiple types of traffic transmission requirements. Furthermore, TSO is compared with other baseline scheduling solutions, and TSO shows efficacy regarding execution time and schedulability. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {In this paper, we address the thesis defence scheduling problem, a critical academic scheduling management process, which has been overshadowed in the literature by its counterparts, course timetabling and exam scheduling. Specifically, we address the single defence assignment type of thesis defence scheduling problems, where each committee is assigned to a single defence, scheduled for a specific day, hour and room. We formulate a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model, which aims to be applicable to a broader set of cases than other single defence assignment models present in the literature, which have a focus on the characteristics of their universities. For such a purpose, we introduce a different decision variable, propose constraint formulations that are not regulation and policy specific, and cover and offer new takes on the more common objectives seen in the literature. We also include new objective functions based on our experience with the problem at our university and by applying knowledge from other academic scheduling problems. We also propose a two-stage solution approach. The first stage is employed to find the number of schedulable defences, enabling the optimisation of instances with unschedulable defences. The second stage is an implementation of the augmented ϵ-constraint method, which allows for the search of a set of different and non-dominated solutions while skipping redundant iterations. The methodology is tested for case-studies from our university, significantly outperforming the solutions found by human schedulers. A novel instance generator for thesis scheduling problems is presented. Its main benefit is the generation of the availability of committee members and rooms in availability and unavailability blocks, resembling their real-world counterparts. A set of 96 randomly generated instances of varying sizes is solved and analysed regarding their relative computational performance, the number of schedulable defences and the distribution of the considered types of iterations. The proposed method can find the optimal number of schedulable defences and present non-dominated solutions within the set time limits for every tested instance. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Hydrogen energy is playing an increasingly important role in integrated energy systems (IES) due to its multiple uses. Green hydrogen can be produced from electricity generated from renewable energy, reducing carbon emissions and environmental pollution. Previous work usually only considers electric vehicles (EVs) as flexible loads, and there are few studies on the production and application process of green hydrogen. In this paper, hydrogen electrolysis centers (HECs) and EVs are simultaneously schedulable loads, integrated into IES, and optimized. The distribution network model is established, and the optimization goal is to minimize network loss while ensuring the safe operation of the power grid. Through the power flow optimization method of mixed-integer second-order cone programming, the space optimization scheduling of EVs in the IES is carried out, and the optimal location of the HEC is reasonably planned and set. A simulation instance of IEEE 33 nodes is used to verify the proposed method. The final results show that this method can minimize network loss in the range of safe operation of the system for the spatial scheduling of electrolytic hydrogen centers and EVs.

	abstract = {We study the practical setting in which regular- and reserve-crew schedules are dynamically maintained up to the day of executing the schedule. At each day preceding the execution of the schedule, disruptions occur due to sudden unavailability of personnel, making the planned regular and reserve-crew schedules infeasible for its execution day. This paper studies the fundamental question how to repair the schedules’ infeasibility in the days preceding the execution, taking into account labor regulations. We propose a robust repair strategy that maintains flexibility in order to cope with additional future disruptions. The flexibility in reserve-crew usage is explicitly considered through evaluating the expected shortfall of the reserve-crew schedule based on a Markov chain formulation. The core of our approach relies on iteratively solving a set-covering formulation, which we call the Robust Crew Recovery Problem, which encapsulates this flexibility notion for reserve crew usage. A tailored branch-and-price algorithm is developed for solving the Robust Crew Recovery Problem to optimality. The corresponding pricing problem is efficiently solved by a newly developed pulse algorithm. Based on actual data from a medium-sized hub-and-spoke airline, we show that embracing our approach leads to fewer flight cancellations and fewer last-minute alterations, compared to repairing disrupted schedules without considering our robust measure. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The increased uptake of variable renewable energy sources has increased electricity price volatility in many energy pool markets, providing an opportunity for storage systems to profit through energy arbitrage. Comparison between the cost or value of storage systems engaging in energy arbitrage should be performed on a levelised basis due to differences in system lifetime. Existing energy arbitrage models with bid/offer curves and imperfect forecasting are typically computationally expensive and are impractical for calculating lifetime levelised cost metrics. In this work, an open-source modular energy arbitrage model with bid and offer curve inputs was developed for a lithium-ion battery energy storage system (BESS) and pumped hydro system (PHS) to analyse lifetime levelised cost and revenue. The mixed integer linear program scheduling module included a new piece-wise linearised description of PHS charging behaviour for rapid optimisation. A one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis indicated that levelised cost and revenue were highly sensitive to discharging efficiency. In a case study based on Australia’s National Electricity Market, imperfect forecasting with no risk hedging was found to increase levelised costs by up to 24% and decrease levelised revenue by up to 50% relative to perfect price forecasting, despite 95% of prices being forecast to be within $35/MWh of the actual trading price. BESS levelised costs were more significantly correlated with consistent low risk bids (Kendall Tau-b of 0.75), since the undiscounted capital costs contribute to a larger proportion of the overall costs than in the PHS systems. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The integrated scheduling of quay cranes, internal vehicles, and yard cranes in container terminals aims to improve port operations and often requires scheduling robustness under uncertainty with cascade effects. In container terminal operations, uncertainty in equipment operating time poses challenges to effective scheduling, as even small fluctuations can create cascade effects throughout the operations, rendering the original schedule ineffective. This research aims to develop a new method that enables a balance between optimization and robustness in container terminal scheduling. Additionally, the double-cycling operation mode and U-shaped port layout, known for their improved efficiency in container terminals, are gaining increasing attention and hence are incorporated into this study. It creates a three-stage hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with bi-directional flows, waiting time, and uncertain operation time. To address the complex problem, a mixed integer programming model is proposed to characterize the integrated scheduling problem, and an index based on complex network structure entropy is designed to evaluate the anti-cascade effect as well as the robustness of the schedule. The index and makespan serve as the bi-objectives, transforming the original problem into a bi-objective optimization one. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-Ⅱ with appropriate coding and decoding rules is utilized to solve the model and obtain a set of Pareto frontier solutions. The feasibility of the new method is verified through a real case analysis. Specifically, comparative analysis with basic stochastic programming, basic robust optimization, triangular fuzzy programming, and maximum gap method are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method. The paper also provides insightful practical implications for port managers, and the genericity of the method could also contribute to its practical values spreading to a wider scope of beneficiaries, such as manufacturing warehousing and distribution management. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {E-mobility represents an important part of the EU’s green transition and one of the key drivers for reducing CO2 pollution in urban areas. To accelerate the e-mobility sector’s development it is necessary to invest in energy infrastructure and to assure favorable conditions in terms of competitive electricity prices to make the technology even more attractive. Large peak consumption of parking lots which use different variants of uncoordinated charging strategies increases grid problems and increases electricity supply costs. On the other hand, as observed lately in energy markets, different, mostly uncontrollable, factors can drive electricity prices to extreme levels, making the use of electric vehicles very expensive. In order to reduce exposure to these extreme conditions, it is essential to identify the optimal way to supply parking lots in the long term and to apply an adequate charging strategy that can help to reduce costs for end consumers and bring higher profit for parking lot owners. The significant decline in photovoltaic (PV) and battery storage technology costs makes them an ideal complement for the future supply of parking lots if they are used in an optimal manner in coordination with an adequate charging strategy. This paper addresses the optimal power supply investment problem related to parking lot electricity supply coupled with the application of an optimal EV charging strategy. The proposed optimization model determines optimal investment decisions related to grid supply and contracted peak power, PV plant capacity, battery storage capacity, and operation while optimizing EV charging. The model uses realistic data of EV charging patterns (arrival, departure, energy requirements, etc.) which are derived from commercial platforms. The model is applied using the data and prices from the Croatian market. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The social and economic development of the islands is generally dependent on the interconnection level with the mainland obtained through maritime transport services. When connecting many islands, the route planning is essential and typically a variety of constraints must be considered. Various optimization methods have been established to improve cost-efficiency but today environmental concerns, like the reduction of CO2 emissions, have become mandatory. This paper proposes a vessel scheduling optimization model able to simultaneously consider compulsory and optional tasks and vehicle-dependent profits. The algorithm was applied to seven islands of the Tyrrhenian Sea located in front of Sicily, named “Aeolian Islands”. Considering the regional requirements in terms of minimum number of routes and maximum fare prices for each season, this research compared the optimal vessels option obtained maximizing the profit with the one obtained minimizing the emissions. In particular, we have conducted three different analyses, in the first one we have considered only the mandatory routes while the second one was carried out identifying a series of potentially attractive additional activities based on historical demand data provided by the company that currently manages the service. Finally, the third analysis addresses a scenario where older fuel-powered vessels were replaced with hybrid electric ones. © 2023},

	abstract = {The Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP) introduced in the early 1980s is the NP-Hard optimization problem of developing the most cost-efficient vehicle schedules for a number of available vehicles that have to start from a depot, pick up and deliver a set of passengers, and return back to the same depot. DARP has been used in many modern applications, including the scheduling of demand-responsive transit and car pooling. This study departs from the original definition of DARP and it extends it by considering an interchange point where vehicles can exchange their picked-up passengers with other vehicles in order to shorten their delivery routes and reduce their running times. In addition to that, this study introduces the concept of generalized passenger travel times in the DARP formulation which translates the increased in-vehicle crowdedness to increased perceived passenger travel times. This addresses a key issue because the perceived in-vehicle travel times of passengers might increase when the vehicle becomes more crowded (i.e., passengers might feel that their travel time is higher when they are not able to find a seat or they are too close to each other increasing the risk of virus transmission or accidents). Given these considerations, this study introduces the Dial-a-Ride Problem with interchange and perceived travel times (DARPi) and models it as a nonlinear programming problem. DARPi is then reformulated to a MILP with the use of linearizations and its search space is tightened with the addition of valid inequalities that are employed when solving the problem to global optimality with Branch-and-Cut. For large problem instances, this study introduces a tabu search-based metaheuristic and performs experiments in benchmark instances used in past literature demonstrating the computation times and solution stability of our approach. The effect of the perceived passenger travel times to the vehicle running costs is also explored in extensive numerical experiments. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Despite the promising outlook, the numerous economic and environmental benefits of offshore wind energy are still compromised by its high Operations and Maintenance (O&M) expenditures. On one hand, offshore-specific challenges such as site remoteness, harsh weather, transportation requirements, and production losses, significantly inflate the O&M costs relative to land-based wind farms. On the other hand, the uncertainties in weather conditions, asset degradation, and electricity prices largely constrain the farm operator’s ability to identify the time windows at which maintenance is possible, let alone optimal. In response, we propose STOCHOS, short for the stochastic holistic opportunistic scheduler—a maintenance scheduling approach tailored to address the unique challenges and uncertainties in offshore wind farms. Given probabilistic forecasts of key environmental and operational parameters, STOCHOS optimally schedules the offshore maintenance tasks by harnessing the opportunities that arise due to favorable weather conditions, on-site maintenance resources, and maximal operating revenues. STOCHOS is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear program, which we solve using a scenario-based rolling horizon algorithm that aligns with the industrial practice. Tested on real-world data from the U.S. North Atlantic where several offshore wind farms are in-development, STOCHOS demonstrates considerable improvements relative to prevalent maintenance benchmarks, across various O&M metrics, including total cost, downtime, resource utilization, and maintenance interruptions. © Copyright © 2023 “IISE”.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a two-stage adaptive robust optimization framework for day-ahead energy and intra-day flexibility self-scheduling of a technical virtual power plant (TVPP). The TVPP exploits diverse distributed energy resources’ (DERs) flexibility capabilities in order to offer flexibility services to wholesale flexibility market as well as preserving the distribution network's operational constraints in the presence of DER uncertainties. The TVPP aims at maximizing its profit in energy and flexibility markets considering the worst-case uncertainty realization. In the proposed framework, the first stage models the TVPP's participation strategy in day-ahead energy market and determines the DERs’ optimal energy dispatch. The second stage addresses the TVPP's strategy in intra-day flexibility market to determine the DERs’ optimal flexibility capability provision by adjusting their energy dispatch for the worst-case realization of uncertainties. The uncertainty characteristics associated with photovoltaic units, electric vehicles, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, and other responsive loads as well as the transmission network's flexibility capability requests are considered using an adaptive robust approach. Adopting the duality theory, the model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and is solved using a column-and-constraint generation algorithm. This model is implemented on a standard test system and the model effectiveness is demonstrated. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Project managers make decisions weighing financial returns (net present value, NPV) and value creation expected by stakeholders. Often, plans maximizing NPV neglect stakeholder benefits while those focused strictly on value creation may reduce financial viability. This paper puts forth a new stochastic optimization model handling this compromise using a mixed integer program solved with reinforcement learning. The model incorporates uncertain activity durations and considers positive and negative cash flows. Our Monte Carlo control method with $\epsilon $ -greedy policies and timed start actions for activities facilitates the simultaneous maximization of NPV and project value. The resulting efficient frontier delineates various project plans, demonstrating the trade-off between maximizing NPV and project value, providing decision makers with visual analysis to select plans that fit organizational needs. Computational experiments demonstrate superior performance over a mathematical solver limited by the problem's complexity and a metaheuristic lacking guided online learning. The results help senior management select satisfactory plans that balance financial returns with stakeholder preferences. The methodology contributes a novel tool for quantitatively incorporating value creation alongside financial objectives in project planning.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With increasing penetration of distributed generators (DG), the uncertainty and intermittence of renewable energy has brought new challenges to the economic dispatch and promotion of environment sustainability of microgrids. Active loads, especially in electric vehicles (EVs), are thought to be an efficient way to deal with the uncertainty and intermittence of renewable energy. One of the most important features of EVs is that their demand will vary in response to the electricity price. How to determine the real-time charging price to guide the orderly charging of EVs and operate with an uncertain renewable energy output represents an important topic for the microgrid operator (MGO). To this end, this paper formulates the optimal pricing and robust dispatch problem of the MGO as a Stackelberg game, in which the upper level minimizes the MGO’s cost, while the lower level minimizes the charging cost of each EV. In the problem, the approximate linear relationship between the node voltage and equivalent load is modeled, and the approximate linear expression of the node voltage security constraint is derived. Using dual optimization theory, the robust optimal dispatch model is transformed into a linear programming model without uncertain variables. Then, the Stackelberg game model is transformed into a mixed integer linear program by using the duality theorem of linear programming. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is proved by simulation within the modified IEEE33-bus system. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Demands for data traffic in high-speed railway (HSR) has increased drastically. The increasing entertainment needs of passengers, safety control information exchanges of trains, etc., make train-To-Train (T2T) communications face the challenge of achieving high-capacity and high-quality data transmissions. In order to greatly increase the communication capacity, it is urgent to introduce millimeter wave (mmWave) technology. Faced with the problem that mmWave link is easy to be blocked, this article leverages the existing equipment to assist relay, and proposes an effective transmission scheduling scheme to improve the robustness of T2T communication systems. First of all, we formulate a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) optimization problem the transmission scheduling in T2T communication systems where mobile relays (MRs) are all working in the full-duplex (FD) mode. Then we propose a low complexity heuristic algorithm to solve the optimization problem, which consists of three components: relay selection, transmission mode selection, and transmission scheduling. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can greatly improve the number of completed flows and system throughput. Finally, we analyze the influence of different design parameters on the system performance. The results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve more data flows and system throughput within a reasonable communication distance threshold in T2T communication with obstacles in different orbits. It can balance the computational complexity and system performance to achieve an efficient and robust data transmission.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The coordinated scheduling of cascade hydropower with photovoltaic (PV) power stations can significantly improve the utilization rate of delivery transmission lines. However, the inherent uncertainty associated with photovoltaic (PV) forecasts challenges the reliable and economic operation of the complementary energy system. Against this background, in this paper, a day-ahead, chance-constrained scheduling for cascaded hydro–photovoltaic complementary generation systems (CHPSs) considering the transmission capacity is proposed. Firstly, the uncertainty of PV forecast errors is simulated by a probability density function fitted using kernel density estimation with historical sampling data. Then, a chance-constrained optimization model considering peak-shaving demands of the receiving-end power grid is developed to determine the day-ahead optimal schedules of CHPSs. Also, complex hydraulic coupling and unit operation constraints of cascade hydropower are considered in the proposed model. To deal with the nonlinear and stochastic constraints, an efficient linearization method is adopted to transform the proposed model into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility are verified by case studies. The results show that the day-ahead schedule optimized by the proposed method can fully balance peak-shaving and photovoltaic accommodation while considering photovoltaic output uncertainty. © 2023 by the authors.},

To reduce the computational complexity of PSU-1UC, this paper constructs the convex hull of PSU-1UC. Focusing on the possible combinations of generating and pumping time intervals, we first establish a dynamic program (DP) model which is solved in polynomial time. Second, a set of public variables were defined to describe the coupling relationship between different consecutive time intervals. Then, we reformulate the DP model into a linear programming (LP) model in a higher-dimensional space, which provides the convex hull formulation of PSU-1UC. Finally, we theoretically prove that the optimal solutions of the proposed convex hull model and the original MIP are the same. The exponential time complexity of PSU-1UC is reduced to polynomial time complexity, which will speed up the PSU self-scheduling/bidding problems and the decomposed algorithm for large-scale hydrothermal UC problems.

Given its high-dimensional and combinatorial nature, developing a precise mathematical optimization technique to solve the entire problem remains challenging, particularly for real-size block models. The primary objective of this study was to propose a method that combines a nested pit strategy with integer programming (IP) models to overcome computational limitations by reducing the problem’s complexity, decreasing solution times, and providing insights into alternative production schedules for large-scale open-pit mines. The proposed algorithm strategically fixes the decision variables based on parametric analysis of the ultimate pit limit to simplify the IP model. The approach was applied to various block models from MineLib, and the results were compared with standard IP solutions and findings from related studies using alternative algorithms. Applying the proposed method demonstrated significant reductions in the solution time (up to 95%) and the ability to solve intractable models. © Hasozdemir K., Erçelebi S. G., 2024.},

	abstract = {The distributed hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (DHFSP), which integrates distributed manufacturing models with parallel machines, has gained significant attention. However, in actual scheduling, some adjacent machines do not have buffers between them, resulting in blocking. This paper focuses on addressing the DHFSP with blocking constraints (DBHFSP) based on the actual production conditions. To solve DBHFSP, we construct a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for DBHFSP and validate its correctness using the Gurobi solver. Then, an advanced iterated greedy (AIG) algorithm is designed to minimize the makespan, in which we modify the Nawaz, Enscore, and Ham (NEH) heuristic to solve blocking constraints. To balance the global and local search capabilities of AIG, two effective inter-factory neighborhood search strategies and a swap-based local search strategy are designed. Additionally, each factory is mutually independent, and the movement within one factory does not affect the others. In view of this, we specifically designed a memory-based decoding method for insertion operations to reduce the computation time of the objective. Finally, two shaking strategies are incorporated into the algorithm to mitigate premature convergence. Five advanced algorithms are used to conduct comparative experiments with AIG on 80 test instances, and experimental results illustrate that the makespan and the relative percentage increase (RPI) obtained by AIG are 1.0% and 86.1% respectively, better than the comparative algorithms.  © 2021 TUP.},

	abstract = {Taichung is the center of the Taiwanese precision optical industry. Optics companies are modernized and automated, with most running 24 h production lines. With machines running around the clock, production lines must be assigned engineers to handle unexpected situations. The optical lens industry depends on precision technology. For fully automated production lines, each production process requires an engineer to be on call to troubleshoot production problems in real-time. However, shifts are currently scheduled manually, and the staff of each unit are responsible for scheduling the various production processes for each month. Administrative staff for each engineering department must take half a day to one day to complete the shift for a month, with results that usually do not ensure the best average workload, often leading engineers to question its fairness. Considering the manpower requirements for the actual production line shift and the fairness of balancing shifts, the scope of this study is the shift scheduling of engineering staff in the assembly line to perform different duties during a fixed cycle. The research aims to provide a solution for Glorytek to increase the efficiency of engineering shift scheduling and optimize the allocation of engineering staff. We will compare the duty allocation and efficiency of the current manual shift scheduling system with a new automated one. The results show that the efficiency of shift scheduling arrangements increased by more than 96%, and the maximum number of days of staff attendance (5 days) is less than that for manual assignment (6 days) while still satisfying the shift limits stipulated by the company. Two factors remain when implementing the proposed system. First, due to technical concerns, the internal process of the scheduling arrangement would be shifted from administrative staff to the IT department. Another concern is the inevitable investment in off-the-shelf optimization software. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key technique for distributed machine learning (ML). Most literature on FL has focused on ML model training for (i) a single task/model, with (ii) a synchronous scheme for updating model parameters, and (iii) a static data distribution setting across devices, which is often not realistic in practical wireless environments. To address this, we develop DMA-FL considering dynamic FL with multiple downstream tasks/models over an asynchronous model update architecture. We first characterize convergence via introducing scheduling tensors and rectangular functions to capture the impact of system parameters on learning performance. Our analysis sheds light on the joint impact of device training variables (e.g., number of local gradient descent steps), asynchronous scheduling decisions (i.e., when a device trains a task), and dynamic data drifts on the performance of ML training for different tasks. Leveraging these results, we formulate an optimization for jointly configuring resource allocation and device scheduling to strike an efficient trade-off between energy consumption and ML performance. Our solver for the resulting non-convex mixed integer program employs constraint relaxations and successive convex approximations with convergence guarantees. Through numerical experiments, we reveal that DMA-FL substantially improves the performance-efficiency tradeoff.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Preventive and corrective maintenance-workforce planning for assets is a growing area of research, given the presence of uncertainty. We model a Simulation-Optimization framework to solve this challenging large-scale maintenance-workforce planning problem while considering its stochastic nature inside both the simulation and optimization models. A holistic simulation model is proposed through multiple modules to imitate different aspects of the maintenance process, i.e., spare facilities/storage and workforce. The workforce module represents technicians’ types, skills and levels, and employment life-cycle, including recruitment, promotion, and separation/retirement. The present uncertainty in the simulation model demands its corresponding optimization model to cope with the nature of the problem and guarantee a degree of confidence level of the optimal decisions. Therefore, a Chance Constraints Programming (CCP) method is integrated with an evolutionary optimization algorithm to limit the risk level of violating the random constraints while minimizing the total maintenance cost. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution assisted with Chance Constraints (SA-DE-CC) algorithm are coupled to solve the current problem. The optimization model is proposed to optimize the preventive maintenance frequency and workforce planning problem while implicitly considering corrective maintenance in the simulation model. The Taguchi method performs scenario and risk analysis for multiple CC probability distributions (i.e., Weibull and Normal), confidence levels, and critical parameter combinations. The model's sensitivity analysis and managerial insights are also discussed. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {This paper presents a model for optimising fleet maintenance management with a particular application to train rolling stock fleets. The proposed model produces a joint schedule for train operations and opportunistic predictive maintenance activities with an aim to maximise operational useful life. The model opportunistically allocates predictive maintenance interventions to existing preventive maintenance schedule considering the estimated remaining useful life (RUL) of critical components whilst ensuring fleet availability to meet operational demands as well as resource and time constraints at the maintenance depots. The proposed methodology is described in three phases: (i) definition of the operating context and maintenance resources; (ii) evaluation of feasible opportunistic maintenance timeslots; (iii) optimal maintenance and operations scheduling. The optimisation model, developed as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming problem, is applied to a real industrial case study on a fleet of high-speed trains in Spain. The results show significant improvement in the utilisation of operational life of components compared to the current policies used by the company. Although the model was developed with particular consideration to the train fleets, it can be adapted for other sectors such as bus fleets and airlines with similar operational constraints. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The planning process in urban rail transportation can be split into several stages, including line planning, timetabling, rolling stock scheduling and so on. The outcome of a stage provides inputs or constraints to the subsequent ones. However, while the output can be good or optimal at each stage, it rarely considers the global quality for the overall planning process. Furthermore, problems tackled at planning phase often use a more aggregate representation of reality, to achieve a more general overview. An integrated approach, while more complex to solve, may mitigate the gap between solution of different stages and a validation of a plan would still be required before its implementation in practice. In this paper, we focus on integrated optimization of train timetabling and rolling stock circulation for urban rail transit line with time-based origin-destination-dependent passenger travel demand and heterogeneous rolling stocks. The aim is to generate a comfortable timetable for passengers and an efficient timetable for operators. The objective is to minimize the total waiting time for passengers and the costs for operators, while constraints regarding train movements, passenger boarding and alighting, available rolling stocks and their capacity are considered. A mixed integer linear programming model is formulated and solved by an iterative programming approach. Computational experiments are performed on the Chongqing Rail Transit Line 2 to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model and solving method. With respect to CPLEX, results show the proposed iterative programming approach has advantages both on computation time and solution quality. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a parcel delivery scheduling problem of minimizing the total duration for a truck-drone distribution system to serve a given set of customers. The single carrier truck plays the role of a mobile depot of multiple identical drones, and the drones with unit capacity perform the last-mile delivery from the carrier truck to each customer. An ordered set of truck stops for launching/retrieving drones is also given, and it constitutes a fixed route of the carrier truck. For the last-mile delivery of a drone to a customer, the launching stop and the retrieving stop of the drone must be the same. We newly introduce an integral parameter of access grade to an underlying parcel delivery model in order to obtain a flight time bound for each customer. By the flight time bound as a threshold, the given set of truck stops is partitioned into two disjoint subsets, namely sets of nearer stops and of farther stops. The carrier truck is required to choose a stop from the set of nearer stops for launching a drone to each customer. The access grade of nearer stops yields a generalized parcel delivery model, since it involves the case with a sufficiently large bound on the flight time as the underlying parcel delivery model with no access restriction to truck stops. In this paper, we first review an integer programming (IP) formulation of the underlying parcel delivery model, and then we modify it into the generalized version with the access grade of nearer stops. We also conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the solution quality of the generalized version by utilizing an IP solver, and report the results. © 2024 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

	abstract = {The significant increase in large-scale wildfire events in recent decades, caused primarily by climate change, has resulted in a growing number of aerial resources being used in suppression efforts. Present-day management lacks efficient and scalable algorithms for complex aerial resource allocation and scheduling for the extinction of such fires, which is crucial to ensuring safety while maximizing the efficiency of operations. In this work, we present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization model tailored to large-scale wildfires for the daily scheduling of aerial operations. The main objective is to achieve a prioritized target water flow over all areas of operation and all time periods. Minimal target completion across individual areas and time periods and total water output are also maximized as secondary and ternary objectives, respectively. An efficient and scalable multi-start heuristic, combining a randomized greedy approach with simulated annealing employing large neighborhood search techniques, is proposed for larger instances. A diverse set of problem instances is generated with varying sizes and extinction strategies to test the approaches. Results indicate that the heuristic can achieve (near)-optimal solutions for smaller instances solvable by the MILP, and gives solutions approaching target water flows for larger problem sizes. The algorithm is parallelizable and has been shown to give promising results in a small number of iterations, making it applicable for both night-before planning and, more time-sensitive, early-morning scheduling. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Dispatching vehicle fleets to serve flights is a key task in airport ground handling (AGH). Due to the notable growth of flights, it is challenging to simultaneously schedule multiple types of operations (services) for a large number of flights, where each type of operation is performed by one specific vehicle fleet. To tackle this issue, we first represent the operation scheduling as a complex vehicle routing problem and formulate it as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. Then given the graph representation of the MILP model, we propose a learning assisted large neighborhood search (LNS) method using data generated based on real scenarios, where we integrate imitation learning and graph convolutional network (GCN) to learn a destroy operator to automatically select variables, and employ an off-the-shelf solver as the repair operator to reoptimize the selected variables. Experimental results based on a real airport show that the proposed method allows for handling up to 200 flights with 10 types of operations simultaneously, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the learned method performs consistently accompanying different solvers, and generalizes well on larger instances, verifying the versatility and scalability of our method. © 1989-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We deal with a challenging scheduling problem on parallel machines with sequence-dependent setup times and release dates from a real-world application of semiconductor work-shop production. There, jobs can only be processed by dedicated machines, thus few machines can determine the makespan almost regardless of how jobs are scheduled on the remaining ones. This causes problems when machines fail and jobs need to be rescheduled. Instead of optimising only the makespan, we put the individual machine spans in non-ascending order and lexicographically minimise the resulting tuples. This achieves that all machines complete as early as possible and increases the robustness of the schedule. We study the application of answer-set programming (ASP) to solve this problem. While ASP eases modelling, the combination of timing constraints and the considered objective function challenges current solving technology. The former issue is addressed by using an extension of ASP by difference logic. For the latter, we devise different algorithms that use multi-shot solving. To tackle industrial-sized instances, we study different approximations and heuristics. Our experimental results show that ASP is indeed a promising knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) paradigm for this problem and is competitive with state-of-the-art constraint programming (CP) and Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solvers.  © The Author(s), 2023.

	abstract = {Multi-agent based small scaled smart grid reinforcement scheme is proposed to manage energy resources by enhancing resilience to supply power to critical loads in peak demand by leveraging demand side management (DSM) for smoothing load profile and optimal energy storage system (ESS) scheduling in response to grid cost. Interconnected microgrids comprise diverse energy resources that allow sharing energy to balance fluctuation by deploying a market that rewards cheap energy. Three stages are defined in this proposed scheme. In the first stage, without DER, consumption charges are reduced to 7.1% through DSM, but customer comfort is compromised. In the second stage, microgrids comprise RER; energy consumption-related charges are reduced to 92.2% by the feed-in tariff (FIT) Program. In the final stage, the inclusion of energy market for trading among microgrids (ESS, diesel and RER) resulting in reduced charges greater than charges incurred from the grid is defined by 122.1%. The findings show that the average power drawn from utility grid increased from 134.7kW to 205.3kW, and peak demand decreased from 591kW to 495kW. Integer linear programming optimization technique is applied to allow the optimal dispatch of microgrids generation to reduce the operation cost to 42.64%. Less reliance on the grid, flexible energy use, and avoiding costly electricity purchases are achieved through DSM, effective resources scheduling, and energy trading.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The methodology described in this article enables a type of holistic fleet optimization that simultaneously considers the composition and activity of a fleet through time as well as the design of individual systems within the fleet. Often, real-world system design optimization and fleet-level acquisition optimization are treated separately due to the prohibitive scale and complexity of each problem. This means that fleet-level schedules are typically limited to the inclusion of predefined system configurations and are blind to a rich spectrum of system design alternatives. Similarly, system design optimization often considers a system in isolation from the fleet and is blind to numerous, complex portfolio-level considerations. In reality, these two problems are highly interconnected. To properly address this system-fleet design interdependence, we present a general method for efficiently incorporating multi-objective system design trade-off information into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) fleet-level optimization. This work is motivated by the authors' experience with large-scale DOD acquisition portfolios. However, the methodology is general to any application where the fleet-level problem is a MILP and there exists at least one system having a design trade space in which two or more design objectives are parameters in the fleet-level MILP. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

The main idea behind time-bucket models is to partition time into fixed-length macroperiods and flexible length microperiods, that lie within the macroperiods. We show that the time-bucket model benefits from advantages of both continuous and discrete time representations. It allows to include important real-world constraints, can be solved with moderate computational effort, and thus promotes MILP for large-scale, industrial problems. We investigate the scalability of the model and apply it to a formulation and filling process from an industrial agrochemical production with 7 formulation lines, intermediate buffer tanks, and 7 filling lines. We optimize a one month period with 50 intermediates, and 83 finished products. A comparison of the MILP solution to a discrete event simulation solution shows that 17% of production capacity can be freed up and significant improvement in on-time delivery. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {High-mobility unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can serve as dual-function aerial service platforms for the Internet of Things (IoT), providing both sensing and communication services for IoT nodes without a base station (BS), particularly in emergency situations. In this paper, a UAV-assisted integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system is proposed for IoT, which simultaneously senses the status information around the IoT and sends the sensing information to both the IoT nodes and a data collection center. In order to assess the sensing performance of ISAC, the radar estimation rate is introduced as a significant metric from the perspective of information theory. Considering the mutual interference between sensing and communications, the radar estimation rate is maximized through the coordinated optimization of UAV task scheduling, transmit power allocation, and 3D flight parameters under the constraint of communication rate. The formulated non-convex mixed-integer programming problem is divided into three subproblems, including UAV task scheduling optimization, UAV sensing and communication power optimization, and UAV 3D flight parameters optimization. The optimal solutions can be achieved by proposing a three-layer iterative optimization algorithm to optimize the three subproblems iteratively. The simulation results show that the radar estimation rate can well measure the sensing performance of the ISAC, which can be effectively improved by optimizing the 3D UAV flight parameters.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The optimization of airport taxi routes is crucial for increasing airport capacity and resource utilization. However, existing methods for preplanning schedules are often time-consuming. To address this, we propose a new approach that reduces the problem scale by predicting the intersection state in the airport taxiway network using a spatial–temporal graph neural network (STGNN) that incorporates a graph convolutional network and recursive neural network with an attention mechanism. A mixed-integer linear problem (MILP) model for taxi route assignment is established based on a subgraph obtained from the prediction results. Our approach treats time as a continuous variable without discretization, allowing aircraft to stop and wait at any node to avoid conflict. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by testing it on actual operation data from Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK). Compared with several baseline algorithms, the method developed in this study has a significant impact on improving airport transportation efficiency. The results indicate that our method not only produces high-quality solutions but also operates in real time. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In project scheduling with uncertain processing times, the decision maker often needs to compute a baseline schedule in advance while guaranteeing that some jobs will not be rescheduled later. Standard robust approaches either produce a schedule with a very large makespan or offer no guarantee on starting times of the jobs. The concept of anchor-robustness is introduced as a middle ground between these approaches. A subset of jobs is said to be anchored if the starting times of its jobs in the baseline schedule can be guaranteed. The Anchor-Robust Project Scheduling Problem(AnchRobPSP) is proposed as a robust two-stage problem to find a baseline schedule of bounded makespan and a maxweight subset of anchored jobs. AnchRobPSP is considered for several uncertainty sets, such as box or budgeted uncertainty sets. Dedicated graph models are presented. In particular, the existence of a compact mixed integer programming reformulation for budgeted uncertainty is proven. AnchRobPSP is shown to be NP-hard even for budgeted uncertainty. Polynomial and pseudopolynomial algorithms are devised for box uncertainty and special cases of budgeted uncertainty. According to numerical results, the proposed approaches solve large-scale instances and outperform classical affine decisions rules for AnchRobPSP. Insights on the price of anchor-robustness are given based on computations. Copyright:  © 2022 INFORMS.},

	abstract = {In modern production- distribution supply chains, decentralization has increased significantly, due to increasing production network efficiency. This study investigates a production scheduling and vehicle routing problem in a make-to-order context under a decentralized decision-making structure. Specifically, two different decision makers hierarchically decide the production and distribution schedules to minimize their incurred costs and we formulate the problem as a bi-level mixed-integer optimization model as a static Stackelberg game between manufacturer and distributor. At the upper level, the manufacturer decides its best scheduling under a flexible job-shop manufacturing system, and at the lower level, the distributor decides its distribution scheduling (routing) which influences the upper-level decisions. The model derives the best production- distribution scheduling scheme, with the objective of minimizing the cost of the manufacturer (leader) at the lowest possible cost for the distributor (follower). As the lower level represents a mixed-integer programming problem, it is challenging to solve the resulting bi-level model. Therefore, we extend an efficient decomposition algorithm based on Duplication Method and Column Generation. Finally, to discuss the decentralization value, the results of the presented bi-level model are compared with those of the centralized approach.  © The authors.

	abstract = {This paper presents an approach for reducing the memory requirements of periodically executed dataflow applications, while minimizing the period when deployed on a many-core target. Often, implementations of dataflow applications suffer from data duplication if identical data has to be processed by multiple actors. In fact, multi-cast (also called fork) actors can produce huge memory overheads when storing and communicating copies of the same data. As a remedy, so-called Multi-Reader Buffers (MRBs) can be utilized to forward identical data to multiple actors in a First In First Out (FIFO) manner while storing each data item only once by sharing. However, using MRBs may increase the achievable period due to contention when accessing the shared data. This paper proposes a novel multi-objective design space exploration approach that selectively replaces multi-cast actors with MRBs and explores actor and FIFO channel mappings to find trade-offs between the objectives of period, memory footprint, and core cost. In distinction to the state-of-the-art, our approach considers (i) memory-size constraints for on-chip memories, (ii) hierarchical memories to implement the buffers, e.g., tile-local memories, (iii) supports heterogeneous many-core platforms, i.e., core-type dependent actor execution times, and (iv) optimizes the buffer placement and overall scheduling to minimize the execution period by proposing a novel combined actor and communication scheduling heuristic for period minimization called Communication-Aware Periodic Scheduling on Heterogeneous Many-core Systems (CAPS-HMS). Our results show that the explored Pareto fronts improve a hypervolume indicator over a reference approach by up to 66 % for small to mid-size applications and 90 % for large applications. Moreover, selectively replacing multi-cast actors with corresponding MRBs proves to be always superior to never or always replacing them. Finally, it is shown that the quality of the explored Pareto fronts does not degrade when replacing the efficient scheduling heuristic CAPS-HMS by an Integer Linear Program (ILP) solver that requires orders of magnitude higher solver times and thus cannot be applied to large scale dataflow network problems. © 2013 IEEE.},

This paper will consider the cold chain distribution of multi-vehicle coexistence, build an integer programming model, design a targeted ACO (Ant Colony Optimization) solution model, and verify it with an example. Based on multi-source visual information fusion technology, these independent heterogeneous data sources are accessed through cloud computing resource integration technology to establish a unified data integration middleware. The pheromone update model selected in this paper is the ant week model, which uses global information to record the optimal path of ants. The results show that the satisfaction of delivery time is far behind, and even the average satisfaction of key customers with high value is only 55.1%, which is 18.3% higher than that of the planning without considering value.

	abstract = {As more uncontrollable renewable energy sources are present in the power generation portfolio, the need of more detailed and reliable tools for the optimal operation of energy systems has increased in the last years. This work presents a multi-stage stochastic Mixed Integer Linear Program with binary recourse for optimizing the day-ahead unit commitment of power plants and virtual power plants operating in the day-ahead and ancillary services markets. Scenarios reproduce the uncertainty of the ancillary services market requests, and production of photovoltaic panels. A novel decomposition algorithm is proposed to tackle the challenging multistage stochastic program. The methodology is tested on three types of large power plants: a natural gas-fired combined cycle, a combined heat and power combined cycle with thermal storage, and a virtual power plant integrating a combined cycle with battery and photovoltaic fields. Compared to the typical deterministic unit commitment approach, the proposed stochastic optimization approach allows to increase the revenues of the conventional power plant up to 13.58% and, for the combined heat and power and virtual power plant case, it allows finding a feasible and efficient operational scheduling. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The present work deals with the multi-product straight pipeline scheduling problem. The considered straight pipeline system is used to transport refined petroleum products from a single source (refinery with storage tanks) to a single destination (distribution center). The main objective is to find a sequence of batches which aims to maximize the total volume to be transported via the pipeline, while meeting the daily customer demands over a fixed time horizon. Each batch contains only one product with a volume between its upper and lower bounds. Constraints related to inventory levels, batch settling periods and forbidden sequences between pairs of products must be respected, and pipeline stoppage periods should also be handled. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP)-like algorithm are proposed to tackle the problem under study. The MILP model is based on the discharging time axis with continuous representation for both time and volume formulation. The GRASP-like algorithm is composed of a construction method and an improvement procedure. The construction method generates a new sequence of batches in a random way with the use of a repair process to obtain an initial solution that satisfies all demands. Then, the improvement procedure is attempted to increase the fill rate of pipeline using volume optimization operators without change the sequence of products. A set of instances was generated from a real case study in order to validate the proposed approach. The performance of our approach is benchmarked against the MILP model (solved using Gurobi Solver), and the numerical experiments proved that the proposed approach obtains very competitive results both in term of solution quality and CPU time. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

An example is represented by the logistics sector, where UAVs have been proven to be able to improve the efficiency of the process itself, as their cooperation with trucks can decrease the delivery time and reduce fuel consumption. In this paper, we first state a mathematical formulation of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) applied to logistic routing, where a truck cooperates synchronously with multiple UAVs for parcel delivery. Then, we propose, implement, and compare different sub-optimal routing approaches to the formulated mFSTSP (multiple Flying Sidekick Travelling Salesman Problem) since the inherent combinatorial computational complexity of the problem makes it unattractable for commercial Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers. A local search algorithm, two hybrid genetic algorithms that permutate feasible and infeasible solutions, and an alternative ad-hoc greedy method are evaluated in terms of the total delivery time of the output schedule. For the sake of the evaluation, the savings in terms of delivery time over the well-documented truck-only TSP solution are investigated for each proposed routing solution, and this is repeated for two different scenarios. Monte Carlo simulations corroborate the results. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) and clean energy play a crucial role in addressing the pressing challenges of climate change, environmental degradation, and energy security. However, the increasing adoption of EVs brings with it several challenges related to the charging load. This paper proposes a new stochastic approach for coordinated charging/discharging of EVs in a parking lot powered with photovoltaic (PV) energy systems. The main aim of the strategy is to schedule the charging/discharging of EVs to satisfy their energy needs while minimizing the operating cost of the parking lot. In this study, the coordinated grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operating modes are compared against the first-come/first-serve (FCFS) charging mode. To obtain practical results, different uncertainties associated with EVs and PV generation are considered using stochastic optimization. The uncertainties are considered using the sample average approximation method by applying the Monte Carlo Simulation. Hence, a mixed integer linear programming problem is formulated and is solved using CPLEX to minimize the expected day-ahead operating cost of the parking lot. Several Scenario studies are simulated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which achieved up to 24% reduction in operating costs on weekdays.  © 2013 IEEE.},

This framework optimizes network performance in terms of user throughput fairness, expressed through the α-fairness metric. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer non-convex program, which is intractable. Hence, we propose an extremal-optimization-based algorithm, Parallelized Alpha-fair Drone Deployment (PADD), which solves the problem online, in low-degree polynomial time. We evaluate our proposal by means of numerical simulations over the real topology of a dense city.

To overcome these challenges, this paper studies the day-ahead scheduling of cascaded hydroelectric systems in a restructured electricity market with the presence of uncertainties in electricity price and natural water inflow. To properly model the uncertainty, we consider the unique characteristics of these two types of uncertainties and capture them via the uncertainty set and stochastic scenarios, respectively. A hybrid robust-stochastic optimization model is developed to simultaneously hedge against these two types of uncertainties, which is formulated as a large-scale non-convex optimization problem with mixed integer recourse. After introducing linearization of nonlinear terms, a tailored hybrid decomposition scheme combining Lagrangian relaxation and Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition is adopted to achieve efficient computation of the proposed model. Two real-world cases are conducted to demonstrate the capability and characteristics of the proposed model and algorithms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper, cross-layer optimization problem is considered, namely, the user scheduling and beamforming are jointly discussed, subjecting to the requirement of per-user quality of service and the maximum allowable transmit power for multicell multiuser joint transmission networks. To achieve the goal, a mixed discrete-continuous variables combinational optimization problem is investigated with aiming at maximizing the sum rate of the communication system. To circumvent the original non-convex problem with dynamic solution space, we first transform it into a 0-1 integer and continuous variables optimization problem, and then obtain a tractable form with continuous variables by exploiting the characteristics of the 0-1 integer constraints. Finally, the scheduled users and the optimized beamforming vectors are simultaneously calculated by an alternating optimization algorithm. We also theoretically prove that the base stations allocate zero power to the unscheduled users. Furthermore, two heuristic optimization algorithms are proposed respectively based on brute-force search and greedy search. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, and the optimization approach gets relatively balanced results compared with the other two approaches. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we address a proactive resource-constrained project scheduling problem where resources have several skills and can switch the selected skill at discrete time instants. The objective of this paper is to simultaneously determine the starting times of activities and select the skills of resources to maximize the schedule robustness, while satisfying constraints of precedence, renewable resources and a project deadline. After defining the problem, an integer linear programming model is constructed and the studied problem is proven to be NP-hard. Considering the NP-hardness of the problem, we develop a tabu search embedded with two special algorithms to solve the problem. Based on the characteristics of the problem, a resource allocation algorithm for determining the skill for resources is proposed. The two special algorithms are regarded as two improvement measures to combine with the basic tabu search, leading to three versions of the tabu search, i.e., TS, TS-IM1, and TS-IM12. A commercial mathematical programming solver, which can optimally solve the model, is used as a benchmark for comparing the developed algorithm. Through a computational experiment performed on a randomly generated dataset, the effectiveness of the designed algorithms and the two improvement measures is verified, and the results for single-skilled resources as well as the skill switching of flexible resources are discussed. In addition, the effects of the key parameters on the objective function are also analysed. From the computational results, we can draw several conclusions. First, among the three developed algorithms, TS-IM12, which is the tabu search embedded with two improvement measures, performs best, and compared with the commercial software, TS-IM12 shows a higher efficiency in solving the studied problem. Second, the increase in the resource flexibility should be moderate. Third, the robustness of the baseline schedule increases with an increase of the resource flexibility, the resource availability and the project deadline. Finally, the improvement of the schedule robustness brought by the increase of the resource flexibility or the resource availability will be further magnified as the project deadline extends, while the improvement of the schedule robustness caused by the increase of the resource flexibility will be reduced as the resource availability augments. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

But shared hardware resources are a problem as they add unpredictable delays that affect the schedulability of multicore hard real-time systems. In recent years much effort has been put into modelling interference and proposing scheduling techniques to mitigate its negative effect. Using one of these models, we propose a scheduling technique, based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) that, in combination with a task to core allocator, not only achieves a feasible schedule but also reduces the interference produced by shared hardware resources in the context of hard real-time multicore systems. The evaluation shows how interference is reduced ( $\approx 83.47$ %) and schedulability is increased ( $\approx 12.25$ %) compared to traditional heuristics.  © 2013 IEEE.},

In this paper, a novel passenger-oriented network model is developed for real-time timetable scheduling that can model time-dependent passenger origin-destination demands with consideration of a balanced trade-off between model accuracy and computation speed. Then, a model predictive control (MPC) approach is proposed for the timetable scheduling problem based on the developed model. The resulting MPC optimization problem is a nonlinear non-convex problem. In this context, the online computational complexity becomes the main issue for the real-time feasibility of MPC. To reduce the online computational complexity, the MPC optimization problem is therefore reformulated into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The resulting MILP problem is exactly equivalent to the original MPC optimization problem and can be solved very efficiently by existing MILP solvers, so that we can obtain the solution very fast and realize real-time timetable scheduling.

The routing scheduling of home-based elderly care (RSHEC) programs is closely related to the quality of the home-based elderly care programs. The structural supply problem faced by home-based elderly care programs is a prominent problem, and the RSHEC programs are an important aspect that has rarely been studied. This paper explores RSHEC programs under uncertainty by comprehensively considering the costs of home-based elderly care, such as the fixed costs, time, and transportation costs. First, a deterministic mixed integer programming (MIP) model was constructed to solve the general routing scheduling problem. In addition, to effectively cope with the uncertainty and risk of the modern market, the robust optimization theory and algorithm model are introduced, namely, the mixed integer box set robust optimization (MIBRO) model and the mixed integer ellipsoid set robust optimization (MIERO) model. Finally, MATLAB and the Gurobi package are applied to obtain the solutions of the models. The case verification shows that the MIP model has the lowest total cost under deterministic conditions. However, the MIERO and MIBRO models can achieve more robust RSHEC programs under uncertain conditions. The results prove the effectiveness and feasibility of the optimization model and algorithm, which provides reference value for management decisions regarding home-based elderly care programs. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study extends the multi-depot vehicle scheduling problem with time windows (MDVSPTW) to the case of electric vehicles which can recharge at charging stations located at any point of the service operation area. We propose a mixed-integer nonlinear model for the electric bus multi-depot vehicle scheduling problem with time windows (EB-MDVSPTW). Our formulation considers not only the operational cost of vehicles, but also the waiting times. In addition, it explicitly considers the capacity of charging stations and prohibits the simultaneous charging of different vehicles at the same charger. Chargers are modeled as task nodes of an extended network and can be placed at any location utilizing the charging infrastructure of a city instead of using only bus-dedicated chargers. Further, we linearize the MINLP formulation of the EB-MDVSPTW by reformulating it to a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that can be solved to global optimality. Because EB-MDVSPTW is NP-Hard, we also introduce valid inequalities to tighten the search space of the MILP and we investigate the trade-off between the compactness and the tightness of the problem in benchmark instances with up to 30 trips. In the numerical experiments, we show that the valid inequalities reduce the problem's compactness by increasing up to three times the number of constraints, but, at the same time, improve tightness resulting in computational time improvements of up to 73% in 20-trip instances. The implementation of our exact approach is demonstrated in a toy network and in the benchmark instances of Carpaneto et al. (1989). © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has been extensively studied to enable distributed and tamper-proof data processing in federated learning (FL). Most existing blockchain assisted FL (BFL) frameworks have employed a third-party blockchain network to decentralize the model aggregation process. However, decentralized model aggregation is vulnerable to pooling and collusion attacks from the third-party blockchain network. Driven by this issue, we propose a novel BFL framework that features the integration of training and mining at the client side. To optimize the learning performance of FL, we propose to maximize the long-term time average (LTA) training data size under a constraint of LTA energy consumption. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem of training client selection and resource allocation (i.e., the transmit power and computation frequency at the client side), and solve the long-term mixed integer non-linear program based on a Lyapunov technique. In particular, the proposed dynamic resource allocation and client scheduling (DRACS) algorithm can achieve a trade-off of [ {O}(1/V) , {O}(V) to balance the maximization of the LTA training data size and the minimization of the LTA energy consumption with a control parameter V. Our experimental results show that the proposed DRACS algorithm achieves better learning accuracy than benchmark client scheduling strategies with limited time or energy consumption. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the rapid growth of pilot studies and the adoption of drone-assisted delivery by many e-commerce companies. In practice, delivery companies usually assemble fleets of drones consisting of heterogeneous configurations to satisfy various customer package demands, and this calls for in-depth research on how to deliver packages via drones efficiently. In this study, we extend the classic vehicle routing problem (VRP) by optimally scheduling the operations in a package depot center with a fleet of drones with different capacities, speeds, and maximum flight ranges. The drones travel multiple sorties to serve customers nearby. We formulate this problem as a mixed integer programming (MIP) model that minimizes the total delivery time for a set of packages. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we first develop a FIFO-based genetic algorithm (FBGA) to solve the problem. In anticipation of multiple trips, we further propose a modified, rescheduling-based genetic algorithm (RBGA) that incorporates a small-scale routing-planning optimization model that “reschedules” drone operations at the end of drone sorties, with the objective of minimizing the completion time. The RBGA features the combination of the knapsack problem, the shortest path problem, and a scheduling problem, from which near-optimal delivery plans are obtained for the fleet of drones. We conduct extensive numerical experiments with different numbers of customers and drones to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. The results suggest that compared with MIP, the proposed algorithms solve the problem efficiently for the testing instances, particularly for large instances that MIP fails to solve in time, indicating the practicality of the proposed methods for real-world implementations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Furthermore, there are three different schemes used in GF scheduling, namely, the reactive, the k-repetitions, and the proactive schemes. We devise a mathematical model for the GF services using the k-repetitions scheme as the first model to define such traffic in a single cell. In addition, the GB scheduling model for eMBB traffic is adapted to fit our problem. We formulate the scheduling problem as a mixed-integer non-linear programming optimization problem. We introduce a complete system model that includes GF and GB subsystems. We introduce a novel mixed scheduler that combines the advantages of two well-known schedulers in the literature. We introduce novel machine-learning-based scheduling algorithms and evaluate them in comparison to well-known algorithms in the literature in addition to the optimal bound that we also derive. The results show that the proposed algorithms produce near-optimal results in real time.  © 2013 IEEE.},

To make full use of the facilities of the China Remote Sensing Satellite Ground Station (RSGS), scheduling optimization of these facilities was studied in this paper, which was not well-solved by the original method in the operation system of RSGS. The problem is formulated as a continuous time-based mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. A decomposition optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the large-scale problem, which is difficult to solve using traditional methods. In the first step, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the multi-ground station relay tasks, and the multi-ground station optimization problem is transformed into several single ground station optimization problems. Next, in two additional steps, optimization of the facilities at a single ground station is performed to further reduce the size of the model. The proposed method has been applied to operations systems of RSGS, and the approach presented in this article has demonstrated stable performance and sufficient efficiency online, resulting in the automation of facility scheduling. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {We propose two distributionally robust optimization (DRO) models for a mobile facility (MF) fleet-sizing, routing, and scheduling problem (MFRSP) with time-dependent and random demand as well as methodologies for solving these models. Specifically, given a set of MFs, a planning horizon, and a service region, our models aim to find the number of MFs to use (i.e., fleet size) within the planning horizon and a route and time schedule for each MF in the fleet. The objective is to minimize the fixed cost of establishing the MF fleet plus a risk measure (expectation or mean conditional value at risk) of the operational cost over all demand distributions defined by an ambiguity set. In the first model, we use an ambiguity set based on the demand’s mean, support, and mean absolute deviation. In the second model, we use an ambiguity set that incorporates all distributions within a 1-Wasserstein distance from a reference distribution. To solve the proposed DRO models, we propose a decomposition-based algorithm. In addition, we derive valid lower bound inequalities that efficiently strengthen the master problem in the decomposition algorithm, thus improving convergence. We also derive two families of symmetry-breaking constraints that improve the solvability of the proposed models. Finally, we present extensive computational experiments comparing the operational and computational performance of the proposed models and a stochastic programming model, demonstrating when significant performance improvements could be gained, and derive insights into the MFRSP.

	abstract = {IoT-based smart agriculture plays a significant role in building a high-yield, sustainable, and intelligent modern agriculture. However, limited battery capacity and low-power processors of sensors cannot accommodate the exponential expansion of data from smart agriculture sensing terminals. To overcome the challenges, we introduced solar harvesting and multiaccess edge computing (MEC) to investigate sustainable monitoring of smart agriculture in solar-powered MEC-enabled WSNs. Considering the cyclical and day-night fluctuations of solar energy, we formulate a joint optimization problem for resource scheduling and computation offloading strategy to maximize the minimum weighted computation capacity across the time slots under solar energy constraints. To solve the mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), we propose a multiply-iterated decoupling optimization algorithm by jointly optimizing a computation offloading strategy, energy provision of the solar-powered hybrid access point (HAP), and local CPU frequency as well as time scheduling. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently use solar energy to balance network calculations, improve network energy efficiency, and realize unmanned and sustainable agricultural WSN. © 2023 Juan Gao et al.},

	abstract = {This paper studies optimal criteria for the appointment scheduling of outpatients in a medical imaging center. The main goal of this study is to coordinate the assignments of radiopharmaceuticals and the scheduling of outpatients on imaging scanners. We study a case of a molecular imaging center that offers services for various diagnostic procedures for outpatient requests. Most procedures in molecular imaging involve several steps limited by strict time windows and require a time-sensitive chemical element, technetium-99m (99mTc) with a limited half-life, to produce the radiopharmaceuticals. We investigate the mathematical dynamics of 99mTc dosages to construct optimal schedules for preparing the radiopharmaceuticals. We develop a rigorous mixed-integer programming model to coordinate the assignment of the radiopharmaceuticals and the scheduling of outpatients on the scanners. The objective is to minimize the total deviation from the scheduled scanning times. We also develop a novel, less conservative robust optimization approach to capture the uncertainty raised by the availability of 99mTc. We propose an uncertainty handling mechanism to reduce the uncertainty interval over time recursively. The proposed mechanism avoids over-conservatism and increases the reliability of mathematical robust models. We evaluate the proposed models by multiple criteria. The final results suggest that the robust model is able to schedule up to 40 outpatients with at most 20 percent of deviation from the scheduled scan times with a decent degree of the constraint violation versus 30 outpatients with at most 50 percent according to the current practice. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This research work presents the tri-level optimization framework for the optimal scheduling of grid-connected and autonomous microgrids to diminish power losses and maximize loadability. Since the network's voltage profile depends on the loading level, the flexible load shaping-based demand-side management strategy is incorporated to investigate its impact on microgrid loadability. With the consideration of uncertain parameters related to renewable power generation, load demand, and power loss, voltage limit constraints, the resultant problem is formulated as a stochastic mixed-integer non-linear problem to enhance microgrid loadability and optimize daily operating costs. The interdependency of demand side management program and microgrid loadability is investigated. The seasonal load profiles covering the weekend and weekday loads in winter, summer, and spring/fall seasons are examined in this research work. The enhanced versions of the distribution networks IEEE-33 and IEEE-69 based microgrid test systems are chosen to evaluate the proposed framework in both off-grid and autonomous modes of operation. Simultaneously, the overall customer satisfaction index is evaluated and improved according to the seasonal load profiles winter weekday, winter-weekend, summer-weekday, summer-weekend, spring-weekday, and spring-weekend by 8.68%, 7.97%, 16.7%, 19.62%, 17.14%, 20.50% respectively. The recently reported Whale Optimization Algorithm is adopted to solve the proposed optimization problem, and the obtained simulation results are validated by comparing them with popular metaheuristic algorithms.

	abstract = {Vehicle-based mobile sensing (a.k.a drive-by sensing) is an important means of surveying urban environment by leveraging the mobility of public or private transport vehicles. Buses, for their extensive spatial coverage and reliable operations, have received much attention in drive-by sensing. Existing studies have focused on the assignment of sensors to a set of lines or buses with no operational intervention, which is typically formulated as set covering or subset selection problems. This paper aims to boost the sensing power of bus fleets through active scheduling, by allowing instrumented buses to circulate across multiple lines to deliver optimal sensing outcome. We consider a fleet consisting of instrumented and normal buses, and jointly optimize sensor assignment, bus dispatch, and intra- or inter-line relocations, with the objectives of maximizing sensing quality and minimizing operational costs, while serving all timetabled trips. By making general assumptions on the sensing utility function, we formulate the problem as a nonlinear integer program based on a time-expanded network. A batch scheduling algorithm is developed following linearization techniques to solve the problem efficiently, which is tested in a real-world case study in Chengdu, China. The results show that the proposed scheme can improve the sensing objective by 12.0%–20.5% (single-line scheduling) and 16.3%–32.1% (multi-line scheduling), respectively, while managing to save operational costs by 1.0%. Importantly, to achieve the same level of sensing quality, we found that the sensor investment can be reduced by over 33% when considering active bus scheduling.

The procedures are compared with a previous one (M02) that merges the operating zones of a unit one by one in order. The experiments of the methods in 11 case studies involving a variety of hydropower plants reveal that the second method (M02) should always be recommended due to its strength, which is even more prominent than any other methods in dealing with large-scale problems, and errors occur when using interpolation to estimate the plant-based operating zones at a water head between two sampling water heads. © 2023 by the authors.},

In this paper, an economic scheduling model of an electric–thermal integrated energy system, including a wind turbine, regenerative electric boiler, solar heat collection system, biomass boiler, ground source heat pump and battery is proposed, and a biomass boiler was selected as the auxiliary heat source of the solar heat collection system. A mixed integer linear programming model was established to take the operating cost of the whole system as the target. A day-ahead optimization scheduling strategy considering the demand side response and improving new energy consumption is proposed. In order to verify the influence of the coordinated utilization of the flexible load and energy storage equipment on the optimal scheduling in the model built, three scenarios were set up. Scenario 3 contains energy storage and a flexible load. Compared with scenario 1, the total cost of scenario 3 was reduced by 51.5%, and the abandonment cost of wind energy was reduced by 43.3%. The use of a flexible load and energy storage can effectively reduce the cost and improve new energy consumption. By increasing the capacity of the energy-storage device, the wind power is completely absorbed, but the operation and maintenance cost is increased, so the capacity of energy storage equipment is allocated reasonably according to the actual situation. © 2023 by the authors.},

The competition's problem consists of constructing a compact double round-robin tournament with 16 to 20 teams while respecting various hard constraints and minimizing the penalties from violated soft constraints. This paper focuses on the organization of the ITC2021 competition, with a particular focus on the generation of a set of artificial though challenging, realistic, and diverse problem instances. For the latter, we present a set of features describing the structure of the problem instances, and use these features to construct the so-called instance space for sports timetabling. Several gaps in this space hint that existing problem instances from the literature are not very diverse. We therefore propose a novel integer programming approach to determine the feature values that cover these gaps, and show how to generate associated problem instances.

In our RATT approach, we extend an existing timetable via train augmentation under the given number of rolling stocks and the managerial constraints of a railway company. To this end, we develop three approaches to solve a real-world problem from a Korean high-speed railway company. First, a generic mixed integer programming model based on the network flow structure is formulated. Second, a train generation technique is adopted to the generic model to enhance the model solvability. Finally, an iterative decomposition scheme is tested to handle large scale problems. Through computational experiments, we show that the train generation technique is essential for the RATT approach, and the decomposition scheme should be considered for large scale problems.  © 2013 IEEE.},

In the studied HES, a pair of photovoltaic and battery storage devices is used to supply the electricity demand, and a boiler system to supply the heat demand directly. In addition, a modified cycle power plant acted as a combined heat and power (CHP) unit to increase the generation capacity and supply reliability. The HES is also able to connect to the electric grid to exchange power according to real-time energy prices. The uncertainty of renewable generation, demand levels, and energy prices challenge the decision-making process. To deal with the uncertainty of these overlapping parameters, a comprehensive information-gap decision theory (IGDT) approach is proposed in this paper that, despite other works, considers the uncertainties in an integrated framework and derives risk-averse and risk seeker strategies in different steps. The problem is modeled as mixed-integer linear programming and solved using the GAMS optimization package. Concerning simulation results, from the viewpoint of a risk-seeking decision maker, the increment of the uncertainty degree by 10.906% results in a reduced operating cost of 8.6%. From the viewpoint of a risk-averse decision maker, the increment of the uncertainty degree by 10.208% results in 8.6% more operating cost. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Electric airplanes are expected to take to the skies soon, finding first use cases in small networks within hardly accessible areas, such as island communities. In this context, the environmental footprint of such airplanes will be strongly determined by the energy sources employed when charging them. This letter presents a framework to optimize aircraft assignment, routing and charge schedules explicitly accounting for the energy availability at the different airports, which are assumed to be equipped with renewable energy sources and stationary batteries. Specifically, considering the daily travel demand and weather conditions forecast in advance, we first capture the aircraft operations within a time-expanded directed acyclic graph, and combine it with a dynamic energy model of the individual airports. Second, aiming at minimizing grid-dependency, we leverage our models to frame the optimal electric aircraft and airport operational problem as a mixed-integer linear program that can be solved with global optimality guarantees. Finally, we showcase our framework in a real-world case-study considering one week of operations on the Dutch Leeward Antilles. Our results show that, depending on weather conditions and compared to current schedules, optimizing flights and operations in a renewable-energy-aware manner can reduce grid dependency from 18 to 100%, whilst significantly shrinking the operational window of the airplanes.  © 2017 IEEE.},

Each robot can carry multiple packages simultaneously within its capacity. Given a sufficiently large robot fleet, the objective is to minimize the robots' total travel time to transport the packages within their respective time-window constraints. The problem is shown to be NP-hard, and we design two group-based distributed auction algorithms to solve this task assignment problem. Guided by the auction algorithms, robots first distributively calculate feasible package groups that they can serve, and then communicate to find an assignment of package groups. We quantify the potential of the algorithms with respect to the number of employed robots and the capacity of the robots by considering the robots' total travel time to transport all packages. Simulation results show that the designed algorithms are competitive compared with an exact centralized Integer Linear Program representation solved with the commercial solver Gurobi, and superior to popular greedy algorithms and a heuristic distributed task allocation method. Note to Practitioners - This work presents two group-based distributed auction algorithms for a sufficiently large fleet of robots to efficiently transport a set of dynamically appearing dispersed packages from their initial locations to corresponding destinations within prescribed time-windows. Each robot can carry multiple packages simultaneously within its capacity, and the objective is to minimize the robots' total travel time to transport all the packages within the prescribed time-windows. The paper's practical contributions are threefold: First, the multi-robot task assignment problem is formulated through a robot-group assignment strategy, which enables complex logistic scheduling for tasks grouped according to their distributions and time-windows. Second, we theoretically show that the multi-robot task assignment problem is an NP-hard problem, which implies the necessity for designing approximate task assignment algorithms. Third, the proposed group-based distributed auction algorithms are efficient and can be adapted for real scenarios.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In unsplittable network flow problems, certain nodes must satisfy a combinatorial requirement that the incoming arc flows cannot be split or merged when routed through outgoing arcs. This so-called no-split no-merge requirement arises in unit train scheduling where train consists should remain intact at stations that lack necessary equipment and manpower to attach/detach them. Solving the unsplittable network flow problems with standard mixed-integer programming formulations is computationally difficult due to the large number of binary variables needed to determine matching pairs between incoming and outgoing arcs of nodes with no-split no-merge constraint. In this paper, we study a stochastic variant of the unit train scheduling problem where the demand is uncertain. We develop a novel decision diagram (DD)-based framework that decomposes the underlying two-stage formulation into a master problem that contains the combinatorial requirements and a subproblem that models a continuous network flow problem. The master problem is modeled by a DD in a transformed space of variables with a smaller dimension, leading to a substantial improvement in solution time. Similar to the Benders decomposition technique, the subproblems output cutting planes that are used to refine the master DD. Computational experiments show a significant improvement in solution time of the DD framework compared with that of standard methods. Copyright: © 2023 INFORMS.},

	abstract = {This work addresses a variant of the job shop scheduling problem in which jobs need to be transported to the machines processing their operations by a limited number of vehicles. Given that vehicles must deliver the jobs to the machines for processing and that machines need to finish processing the jobs before they can be transported, machine scheduling and vehicle scheduling are intertwined. A coordinated approach that solves these interrelated problems simultaneously improves the overall performance of the manufacturing system. In the current competitive business environment, and integrated approach is imperative as it boosts cost savings and on-time deliveries. Hence, the job shop scheduling problem with transport resources (JSPT) requires scheduling production operations and transport tasks simultaneously. The JSPT is studied considering the minimization of two alternative performance metrics, namely: makespan and exit time. Optimal solutions are found by a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. However, since integrated production and transportation scheduling is very complex, the MILP model can only handle small-sized problem instances. To find good quality solutions in reasonable computation times, we propose a hybrid particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing algorithm (PSOSA). Furthermore, we derive a fast lower bounding procedure that can be used to evaluate the performance of the heuristic solutions for larger instances. Extensive computational experiments are conducted on 73 benchmark instances, for each of the two performance metrics, to assess the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed PSOSA algorithm. These experiments show that the PSOSA outperforms state-of-the-art solution approaches and is very robust. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {A large number of researchers have addressed social aspects in hierarchical production planning. This article responds to research gaps identified in our previous literature review. Accordingly, consideration of social aspects and the economic implications of social improvements are required in a longer term planning approach. For this, we integrate work intensity as employee utilization in a general mixed-integer programming model for master production scheduling. Following existing fatigue functions, we represent the relationship between work intensity and exhaustion through an employee-utilization-dependent exhaustion function. We account for the economic implications through exhaustion-dependent capacity load factors. We solve our model with a CPLEX standard solver and analyze a case study based on a realistic production system and numerical data. We demonstrate that the consideration of economic implications is necessary to evaluate social improvements. Otherwise, monetary disadvantages are overestimated, and social improvements are, thus, negatively affected. Moreover, from a certain level of work-intensity reduction, demand peaks are smoothed more by pre-production, which requires more core employees, while temporary employment is reduced. Further potential may arise from considering and quantifying other interdependencies, such as employee exhaustion and employee days off. In addition, the relationship between social working conditions and employee turnover can be integrated. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Energy-intensive production sites are often supplied with energy by on-site energy systems. Commonly, the scheduling of the systems is performed sequentially, starting with the scheduling of the production system. Often, the on-site energy system is operated by a different company than the production system. In consequence, the production and the energy system schedule their operation towards misaligned objectives leading in general to suboptimal schedules for both systems. To reflect the independent optimization with misaligned objectives, the scheduling problem of the production system can be formulated as a bilevel problem. We formulate the bilevel problem with mixed-integer decision variables in the upper and the lower level, and propose an algorithm to solve this bilevel problem based on the deterministic and global algorithm by Djelassi, Glass and Mitsos (J Glob Optim 75:341–392, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10898-019-00764-3) for bilevel problems with coupling equality constraints. The algorithm works by discretizing the independent lower-level variables. In the scheduling problem considered herein, the only coupling equality constraints are energy balances in the lower level. Since an intuitive distinction is missing between dependent and independent variables, we specialize the algorithm and add a procedure to identify independent variables to be discretized. Thereby, we preserve convergence guarantees. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated in two case studies. In the case studies, the production system favors different technologies for the energy supply than the energy system. By solving the bilevel problem, the production system identifies an energy demand, which leads to minimal cost. Additionally, we demonstrate the benefits of solving the bilevel problem instead of solving the common integrated or sequential problem. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Airport Slot Allocation (ASA) is a multi-objective, multi-stakeholder decision process that aims to maximise airport capacity utilisation and mitigate delays. Existing ASA studies have considered objectives associated with the slot scheduling process per se without considering the implications of the alternative schedules, represented by the generated efficient frontier, on the operational delays, i.e., the delays that will be encountered when a selected airport schedule will be implemented. Furthermore, one notes the absence of an integrated methodology that incorporates the preferences of all ASA stakeholders/experts in selecting the most preferable airport schedule. This gap becomes more evident when considering the dearth of empirical data with respect to ASA scheduling performance metrics. The ASA framework proposed herein taps the above gaps by considering operational delays and eliciting airport slot schedules through the integration of multi-stakeholder preferences. Computational results using empirical preference data demonstrate the decision-support in determining the most preferable airport slot scheduling solution (or solutions) and its implications on expected delays. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Real-life parallel machine scheduling problems can be characterized by: (i) limited information about the exact task duration at the scheduling time, and (ii) an opportunity to reschedule the remaining tasks each time a task processing is completed and a machine becomes idle. Robust optimization is the natural methodology to cope with the first characteristic of duration uncertainty, yet the existing literature on robust scheduling does not explicitly consider the second characteristic the possibility to adjust decisions as more information about the tasks duration becomes available, despite that re-optimizing the schedule every time new information emerges is standard practice. In this paper, we develop an adaptive robust optimization scheduling approach that takes into account, at the beginning of the planning horizon, the possibility that scheduling decisions can be adjusted. We demonstrate that the suggested approach can lead to better here-and-now decisions and better makespan guarantees. To that end, we develop the first mixed integer linear programming model for adaptive robust scheduling, and a two-stage approximation heuristic, where we minimize the worst-case makespan. Using this model, we show via a numerical study that adaptive scheduling leads to solutions with better and more stable makespan realizations compared to static approaches. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Freight mileages have been significantly increasing over the past decade, accounting for 11% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Freight electrification and platooning are two promising technologies to mitigate the energy and environmental impacts of freight transportation. Effective coordination of charging and platooning are urgently needed to maximize the benefits of these two technologies, especially considering the current inadequate charging infrastructure, long charging duration, higher energy usage, and tight delivery schedules for long-haul electric freight vehicles (EFVs). In this study, we aim to co-optimize the platooning and charging strategies of EFVs. To achieve this goal, we developed a mixed-integer linear programming model to minimize the total system costs, including en-route charging cost, delivery delay cost, and hub charging cost. The proposed model was tested using a case study of a 595-mile Florida interstate highway route and solved by the state-of-the-art branch-and-cut algorithms, through which we demonstrated the effectiveness of using our model to identify the optimal charging and platooning schedules and quantify the spatial distribution of charging demand and platoon energy savings. We also performed sensitivity analyses to better understand the impacts of some critical factors, including the EFV models, charging station (CS) capacity, number of CSs, charging speed, and departure-time windows. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

While most of the existing approaches are developed from the operator's perspective considering EV aggregated demands at the medium-voltage (MV) level, individual users' comfort and the particularities associated with low-voltage (LV) networks need to be considered to holistically assess the EV effects in an integrated MV/LV network. This article proposes a two-level hierarchical optimization framework for the EV charging coordination (EVCC) that maximizes users' satisfaction, while avoiding operational grid issues in the whole distribution system. The framework is tailored for unbalanced distribution systems with high penetration of EVs and introduces a novel index to measure charging priority-based EV user satisfaction. To reduce the computational burden, the EVCC problem is disaggregated into an upper level for MV network operation, and a lower level for LV network and individual EV scheduling, using mixed-integer linear programming models. This framework is later embedded in a dynamic scheduling approach that copes with unexpected EV arrivals. Benefits (increased overall user satisfaction and reduced strain over distribution assets) are demonstrated via case studies in a 459-node three-phase network in which solutions were achieved under a 60-s threshold.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

This paper proposes a novel mathematical model in a two-stage supply chain scheduling to make a coordination between procurement and manufacturing activities.

The goal is to minimize total tardiness. A linearization method is used to ease tractability of the model. A genetic algorithm is developed due to the NP-hard nature of the problem. The parameters of the genetic algorithm are set and estimated by Taguchi's experimental design.

This algorithm is based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP) with speed-up routines. The model considers station capacities explicitly (i.e., the number of available tracks for meeting and overtaking operations). Because the model is too hard for the solvers (CPLEX in this study) to tackle, three speed-up routines were devised when rescheduling trains. These routines are a greedy heuristic to reduce the solution space, using the lazy constraint attribute of the solver and a multiobjective approach to find a good initial feasible solution that conforms to actual railway operation. The algorithm was tested on a hypothetical rail line for different sizes of timetable instances with disturbed trains in a maximum two-hour time horizon. It managed to solve the hardest instances within a three-minute time limit thus minimizing the total weighted delay of rescheduled trains. The optimality gap metric is used to show the effectiveness and efficiencies of the speed-up heuristics developed. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In the poultry industry, the meat market requires a careful coordination of the broiler chicken supply chain comprising breeders, hatcheries, farms, slaughterhouses, wholesale, and retail vendors. Aside from the inherent challenges of coordinating a supply chain, animal husbandry systems face additional complex tasks. The lack of integrated decisions within the poultry chain could lead to a production plan that (a) does not comply with the biosecurity standards required in meat production for human consumption at the farms; (b) violates the production and inventory capacities at the slaughterhouses; and (c) does not meet the demand of customers. To streamline the supply chain, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming model that supports production planning and scheduling decisions in broiler chicken production facilities. In addition, we embedded the mixed-integer programming model in a rolling-horizon scheme to improve scalability and to avoid the myopic effect of time-indexed optimization models that put too much emphasis on a specific time period. We present the results of a case study in a poultry company in Santa Marta (Colombia), where we reach profit improvements that range from 7% to 57% with a reduction in inventory costs that range from 30% to 60%, while simultaneously meeting stringent technical, tactical, and biosecurity constraints. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Volatile electricity prices make demand response attractive for processes that can modulate their production rate. However, if nonlinear dynamic processes must be scheduled simultaneously with their local multi-energy system, the resulting scheduling optimization problems often cannot be solved in real time. For single-input single-output processes, the problem can be simplified without sacrificing feasibility by dynamic ramping constraints that define a derivative of the production rate as the ramping degree of freedom. In this work, we extend dynamic ramping constraints to flat multi-input multi-output processes by a coordinate transformation that gives the true nonlinear ramping limits. Approximating these ramping limits by piecewise affine functions gives a mixed-integer linear formulation that guarantees feasible operation. As a case study, dynamic ramping constraints are derived for a heated reactor-separator process that is subsequently scheduled simultaneously with its multi-energy system. The dynamic ramping formulation bridges the gap between rigorous process models and simplified process representations for real-time scheduling. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) empowers Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with distributed intelligence of industrial automation thanks to its capability of distributed machine learning without any raw data exchange. However, it is rather challenging for lightweight IIoT devices to perform computation-intensive local model training over large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs). Driven by this issue, we develop a communication-computation efficient FL framework for resource-limited IIoT networks that integrates DNN partition technique into the standard FL mechanism, wherein IIoT devices perform local model training over the bottom layers of the objective DNN, and offload the top layers to the edge gateway side. Considering imbalanced data distribution, we derive the device-specific participation rate to involve the devices with better data distribution in more communication rounds. Upon deriving the device-specific participation rate, we propose to minimize the training delay under the constraints of device-specific participation rate, energy consumption and memory usage. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem of device scheduling and resource allocation (i.e. DNN partition point, channel assignment, transmit power, and computation frequency), and solve the long-term min-max mixed integer non-linear programming based on the Lyapunov technique. In particular, the proposed dynamic device scheduling and resource allocation (DDSRA) algorithm can achieve a trade-off to balance the training delay minimization and FL performance. We also provide the FL convergence bound for the DDSRA algorithm with both convex and non-convex settings. Experimental results demonstrate the derived device-specific participation rate in terms of feasibility, and show that the DDSRA algorithm outperforms baselines in terms of test accuracy and convergence time.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the combined offshore wind farm and hydrogen production plant (COWHP) has been installed all around the world and will play an important role in reducing the carbon dioxide emissions. However, the cooperation of the COWHP, the hydrogen pipeline transportation, the power network transmission, and the hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (HFCEVs) scheduling is still an essential problem. This problem falls into the category of mixed-integer nonlinear optimization, which involves a significant number of decision variables and constraints. Existing methods have often struggled to effectively solve this problem due to its inherent complexity and non-linear nature. In this paper, a price-guided method is proposed to cooperate with this complex system. First, the COWHP model, the hydrogen pipeline network scheduling model, the power network flow model, the HFCEVs refuelling microgrid model, and the HFCEV traffic flow model in real-world transportation networks are presented. Second, the price-based cooperation model is proposed. Third, price strategies are deployed to cooperate with the complex system. The decision making trial and evaluation laboratory-the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (Dematel-TOPSIS) method is deployed to evaluate the real-time performance of different strategies. The simulation results reveal that in the small vehicle flow transportation network cases, deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) has the best real-time evaluation performance; whereas for the large vehicle flow transportation network cases, long short term memory (LSTM) has the best real-time performance. From the posterior evaluation view, LSTM has the best performance for all cases to reduce total operation cost, and also reduce the total waiting time.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To serve various tasks requested by various end devices with different requirements, end-edge-cloud (E2C) has attracted more and more attention from specialists in both academia and industry, by combining both benefits of edge and cloud computing. But nowadays, E2C still suffers from low service quality and resource efficiency, due to the geographical distribution of edge resources and the high dynamic of network topology and user mobility. To address these issues, this paper focuses on task offloading, which makes decisions that which resources are allocated to tasks for their processing. This paper first formulates the problem into binary non-linear programming and then proposes a particle swarm optimization (PSO)based algorithm to solve the problem. The proposed algorithm exploits an imbalance mutation operator and a task rescheduling approach to improve the performance of PSO. The proposed algorithm concerns the resource heterogeneity by correlating the probability that a computing node is decided to process a task with its capacity, by the imbalance mutation. The task rescheduling approach improves the acceptance ratio for a task offloading solution, by reassigning rejected tasks to computing nodes with available resources. Extensive simulated experiments are conducted. And the results show that the proposed offloading algorithm has an 8.93%–37.0% higher acceptance ratio than ten of the classical and up-to-date algorithms, and verify the effectiveness of the imbalanced mutation and the task rescheduling. © 2023 CRL Publishing.

The object of this paper is to provide a survey of state-of-the-art methods for reducing energy consumption via (1) enhanced scheduling and (2) enhanced aggregation of traffic flows using Software-Defined Networks (SDN), focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches. We tackle a gap in the literature for a review of SDN-based energy saving techniques and discuss the limitations of multi-controller solutions in terms of constraints on their performance. The main finding of this survey paper is that the two classes of SDN- based methods, scheduling and flow aggregation, significantly reduce energy consumption in DCNs. We also suggest that Machine Learning has the potential to further improve these classes of solutions and argue that hybrid ML-based solutions are the next frontier for the field. The perspective gained as a consequence of this analysis is that advanced ML-based solutions and multi-controller-based solutions may address the limitations of the state-of-the-art, and should be further explored for energy optimization in DCNs. © 2023 Scientific Association for Infocommunications.

The proposed procedure leverages the energy flexibility of reverse osmosis (RO) desalination tracks. RO tracks can operate alternatively in conjunction with water network storage tanks with variable-speed pumps to optimal satisfy water demand at minimum energy and operating costs. The developed model takes into consideration the essential constraints of both the power and water systems to meet consumer demands. Further, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is proposed for the day-ahead operation of the two integrated systems. The simulation findings show that the suggested technique is successful in scheduling the energy-intensive equipment in the two systems to achieve a 26,993 per day savings compared to a 4.6% decrease in overall operating costs when compared to optimizing each system independently.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Efficient task scheduling plays a key role in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-empowered edge computing due to the limitation in energy supply and computation resource on the UAV platforms. This problem becomes much more complicated when the processing-dependent tasks that can be described as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and each of their components can only be processed on a virtual machine or container that deploys the desired service function (SF). In this paper, we first build an optimization problem that aims to minimize the completion time of all DAG tasks subject to constraints including task dependency, computation resource occupied by the UAVs, etc. To tackle this problem, a genetic algorithm-based joint deployment and scheduling algorithm, named GA-JoDeS, is put forward, since solving the established 0–1 integer programming problem in polynomial time is infeasible. Subtask offloading decision and UAV position are encoded into the chromosome in the GA-JoDeS algorithm, and the fitness value of an individual is decided by the maximum completion time of all DAG tasks. Through selection, crossover, and mutation, the GA-JoDeS algorithm evolves until it determines the individual with the optimal fitness value as the suboptimal solution to the problem. To evaluate the performance of the proposal, a series of simulations is conducted, and three traditional methods are chosen as comparison benchmarks. The results show that the GA-JoDeS algorithm can convergence quickly, and it can effectively reduce the completion time of DAG tasks with different parameter settings. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Preventive maintenance (PM) is a maintenance program with activities created at a determined interval or according to certain principles, designed to reduce the likelihood of failure or deterioration of item performance. This aims to improve overall reliability and system availability. In this research, a preventive maintenance schedule (PMS) was designed for electricity and desalination of water in power plants, subject to meeting relevant constraints. The proposed methodology is used to generate a PMS for the boilers, turbines, and distillers. A nonlinear integer programming (NLIP) model was employed to address this problem. The results of the proposed method were compared with the PMS for a power station in Kuwait. The results were better in terms of the volume of production and in terms of the gap between the available production and demand in order to continue providing consumers with electricity and water without a shortage in the event of a breakdown in equipment. It produces an improvement of 12.12% and 16.58% respectively, for water and electricity. Furthermore, the sensitivity and robustness of the proposed method were analysed by increasing the maintenance duration for some equipment, increasing the demand, and adding various additional conditions. In addition, a comparison of additional conditions with a binary problem method in terms of computer time for the search for an optimal solution was carried out, where the model provided an optimal solution in a reasonable time. Among the most important benefits that the user can obtain for this technique are extending the life of the equipment, increasing efficiency, and reducing expenses. © 2022 by the authors.},

Robots must self-coordinate and self-allocate a set of pickup/delivery tasks while minimizing a given cost figure. This results in a large, challenging mixed-integer linear problem that must be cooperatively solved without a central coordinator. We propose a distributed algorithm based on a primal decomposition approach that provides a feasible solution to the problem in finite time. An interesting feature of the proposed scheme is that each robot computes only its own block of solution, thereby preserving privacy of sensible information. The algorithm also exhibits attractive scalability properties that guarantee solvability of the problem even in large networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to provide a scalable distributed solution to the problem. The algorithm is first tested through Gazebo simulations on a ROS 2 platform, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Finally, experiments on a real testbed with a team of ground and aerial robots are provided.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This article concerns a variant of moving target travelling salesman problem where the number and locations of targets vary with time and realizations of random trajectories. Managerial objectives are to maximize the number of visits to different targets and to minimize the total travel distance. Employing a linear value function for finding supported Pareto-efficient solutions, we develop a two-stage stochastic programming model. We propose an iterative randomized dynamic programming (RDP) algorithm which converges to a global optimum with probability one. Each iteration in RDP involves a randomized backward and forward recursion stage as well as options for improving any given schedule: swaps of targets and optimization of timing for visits. An integer linear programming (ILP) model is developed and solved by a standard ILP solver to evaluate the performance of RDP on instances of real data for scheduling an environmental surveillance boat to visit ships navigating in the Baltic Sea. Due to a huge number of binary variables, the ILP model in practice becomes intractable. For small to medium size data sets, the Pareto-efficiency of solutions found by RDP and ILP solver are equal within a reasonable tolerance; however, RDP is significantly faster and able to deal with large-scale problems in practice. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Distribution network operators and planners face a significant challenge in optimizing planning and scheduling strategies to enhance distribution network efficiency. Using improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO), this paper presents an effective method for improving distribution system performance by concurrently deploying remote-controlled sectionalized switches, distributed generation (DG), and optimal network reconfiguration. The proposed optimization problem’s main objectives are to reduce switch costs, maximize reliability, reduce power losses, and enhance voltage profiles. An analytical reliability evaluation is proposed for DG-enhanced reconfigurable distribution systems, considering both switching-only and repairs and switching interruptions. The problem is formulated in the form of a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, which is known as an NP-hard problem. To solve the problem effectively while improving conventional particle swarm optimization (PSO) exploration and exploitation capabilities, a novel chaotic inertia weight and crossover operation mechanism is developed here. It is demonstrated that IPSO can be applied to both single- and multi-objective optimization problems, where distribution systems’ optimization strategies are considered sequentially and simultaneously. Furthermore, IPSO’s effectiveness is validated and evaluated against well-known state-of-the-art metaheuristic techniques for optimizing IEEE 69-node distribution systems. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing plays an essential role in the development of the Internet of Things, which provides-data processing and storage services. Fog computing, the evolution of cloud computing helps provide solutions to cloud-computing challenges, such as latency, location awareness and real-time mobility support. Fog computing fills the gap between the cloud and IoT devices within the close vicinity of IoT devices. So, computation, networking, storage, data management and decision-making occur along the path between the cloud and the IoT devices. The automatic and intelligent management of fog node resources and achieving an effective scheduling policy in the computing model are necessary requirements and will lead to the improvement of the overall performance of fog computing. Some optimization problems are modeled by mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). In this paper, a model; i.e., an MINLP optimization problem on fog computing, is designed. Our model has two goals: to increase cost performance as well as to reduce energy consumption. Cost performance is the price that users are charged as benefit/revenue. In other words, cost performance is defined as the ratio of the average data rate of each user to its cost. Then, the exact mathematical method with the GAMS program was used to prove its logical process. In the next step, we solved the model with genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), simulated annealing+GA (SA+GA), teaching–learning-based optimization (TLBO), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) and random method. According to the TOPSIS comparison, the SA+GA method with a value of 0.23 is the best one compared to other methods. Then come GWO, GA, TLBO, PSO and GOA methods, respectively. © 2023, Scientific Research Support Fund of Jordan. All rights reserved.},

Traditionally, the airline crew scheduling problem is determined by solving the crew pairing problem (CPP) and the crew rostering problem (CRP), sequentially. In this paper, we propose a new heuristic solver based on the parallel genetic algorithm and an innovative crew scheduling algorithm, which improves traditional crew scheduling by integrating CPP and CRP into a single problem. The innovative scheduling method includes a global heuristic search and an adjustment for flights and crew so as to realize crew scheduling. The parallel genetic algorithm is used to divide the population into multiple threads for parallel calculation and to optimize the randomly generated flight sequence to maximize the number of flights that meet the crew configuration. Compared with the genetic algorithm, CPLEX and Gurobi, it shows high optimization efficiency, with a time reduction of 16.57–85.82%. The experiment shows that our crew utilization ratio is higher than that for traditional solvers, achieving almost 44 flights per month, with good scalability and stability in both 206 and 13,954 flight datasets, and can better manage airline crew scheduling in times of crew scarcity. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Volt/Var optimization (VVO) problem is used for scheduling the voltage regulation and reactive power compensation equipment in distribution networks to minimize power loss and voltage violation. In order to solve the VVO problem for a forthcoming time horizon, it is necessary to predict some parameters such as load demand and renewable energy production. The prediction of these parameters is always accompanied by uncertainty that robust optimization can be used to solve this concern. This paper presents a scenario-based robust Volt/Var optimization (RVO) method that significantly reduces the number of scenarios required for the worst-case approach. Solving the VVO problem with the worst-case scenarios reduces the computational burden and maintains the voltage security of the distribution network against the severe events. The proposed RVO is formulated based on a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model in which Volt/Var control (VVC) equipment is scheduled over a two-stage strategy. The proposed method is validated using modified 33-bus and 69-bus IEEE test systems. The results demonstrate that the proposed RVO method maintains the network's voltage profile within the acceptable range against uncertainties. © 2023 The Authors.

The vanadium redox flow battery represents the most mature chemistry for the technology, and it is the most widely commercialized system thanks to its high chemical stability and performance. This work aims to optimize the scheduling of a vanadium redox flow battery that stores energy produced by a renewable power plant, keeping into account a thorough characterization of the battery performance, with variable efficiencies and capacity fade effects. A detailed characterization of the battery performance improves the calculation of the optimal number of cycles and revenue associated with the battery use if compared to the results obtained using simpler models, which take into account constant efficiencies and no capacity fade effects. The presented problem is nonlinear due to the functions of the battery efficiency, which depend upon charging and discharging powers and state of charge with nonlinear, non-convex correlations. Therefore, as per the state of the art of operation research, the problem is linearized using convex hulls in three dimensions. The optimization program also calculates the progressive battery capacity fade due to undesired secondary electrochemical reactions and the economic impact of capacity restoration through periodic maintenance. The final problem is solved as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) to guarantee the global optimality of the linearized problem. The proposed optimization model has been applied to two different case studies. The first is a case of energy arbitrage, where the electric energy produced by a renewable plant is stored when the energy price is low and sold to the grid when the energy price is high to maximize the profit. The second is a case of load-shifting, balancing electric energy generation and demand from a grid-connected renewable energy community, where storage minimizes the expenses for the energy purchased from the grid. The optimization results have been compared to those obtained with constant battery efficiency models, which do not consider the capacity fade effects. Results show that simpler models overestimate the optimal number of cycles of the battery and the revenue by up to 15% if they do not take into account the degradation model of the battery, and respectively up to 32% and 42% if they also assume constant efficiency for the battery. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Dealing with multi-objective problems has several interesting benefits, one of which is that it supplies the decision-maker with complete information regarding the Pareto front, as well as a clear overview of the various trade-offs that are involved in the problem. The selection of such a representative set is, in and of itself, a multi-objective problem that must take into consideration the number of choices to show the uniformity of the representation and/or the coverage of the representation in order to ensure the quality of the solution. In this study, day-ahead scheduling has been transformed into a multi-objective optimization problem due to the inclusion of objectives, such as the operating cost of multi-energy multi-microgrids (MMGs) and the profit of the Distribution Company (DISCO). The purpose of the proposed system is to determine the best day-ahead operation of a combined heat and power (CHP) unit, gas boiler, energy storage, and demand response program, as well as the transaction of electricity and natural gas (NG). Electricity and gas are traded by MGs with DISCO at prices that are dynamic and fixed, respectively. Through scenario generation and probability density functions, the uncertainties of wind speed, solar irradiation, electrical, and heat demands have been considered. By using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for scenario reduction, the high number of generated scenarios has been significantly reduced. The ɛ-constraint approach was used and solved as mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) to obtain a solution that meets the needs of both of these nonlinear objective functions. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper considers using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to survey important sites across a city. When the sites are relatively far from the UAVs' depot, the UAVs may not be able to reach many of the sites. Suppose that a UAV can take public transportation vehicles (PTVs) like a passenger. Then, it may reach a site that is unreachable by flying only. Based on this UAV-PTV scheme, we investigate a task-UAV assignment problem, which assigns a set of surveillance tasks to UAVs. We formulate a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem that minimizes the overall energy consumption of UAVs, subject to that every site is surveyed by a certain number of UAVs during a given time window, and all UAVs successfully return to the depot. Considering that this problem is NP-hard, we present two sub-optimal solutions. The first solution orders the surveillance tasks according to the starting times of their time windows. Then, starting from the earliest one, it assigns the tasks one by one to UAVs. The second solution breaks the tasks into small non-overlapping groups. It then assigns tasks to UAVs group by group. The former solution quickly addresses the assignment problem, but it lacks the overall management of UAV resources. The latter improves this by assigning a group of tasks simultaneously, and it can control the computation complexity by limiting the group size. The comparison with the brute force method shows that the proposed solutions can achieve competitive performance in a reasonable time. Note to Practitioners-Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in surveillance missions. However, one challenge practitioners often meet is the limited flight duration. Commercial UAVs are in general powered by the onboard battery. Due to the restriction of payload, the battery capacity is constrained, which limits the UAVs' operation time. In this paper, we present the approach exploiting public transportation vehicles (PTVs). In our design, a UAV can take a public transportation vehicles such as buses, trams and trains on the roof and transfer between vehicles when necessary. With this UAV-PTV collaboration scheme, we consider how to efficiently assign surveillance tasks to UAVs. Due to the NP-hardness of the considered problem, two suboptimal algorithms are presented.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

The problem is to assign tasks and determine detailed paths to AGVs to keep the multi-AGV system running efficiently and sustainedly.

A hierarchical planning method is used, which decomposes the integrated problem into two levels: the upper-level task-assignment problem and the lower-level path-planning problem.

	abstract = {Currently, hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (HFCEVs) are becoming more financially accessible as an alternative to petroleum-powered vehicles, while also decreasing carbon dioxide emissions. However, the coordinated scheduling of HFCEVs refuelling with the operations of hydrogen refuelling stations, electrical power network (PN), and transportation network (TN) represents an integral challenge. This complex problem encompasses a combinatorial mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem with a sizeable number of decision variables. Existing methods struggle to adequately solve this problem. In this article, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is deployed to determine the refuelling price to guide the HFCEV refuelling in the TN. First, HFCEV traffic flow model based on the refuelling price in real-world TN is presented. Then, the HFCEVs hydrogen demands in the H2 refuelling station ( H2 RS) microgrid are presented. After that, an IEEE 30 nodes PN exporting electricity to H2 RS microgrids is presented. At last, DRL (DDPG, TD3, SAC, PPO) is deployed to determine the price based on the traffic condition of the TN and the voltage condition of the PN. The simulation results demonstrate that through the DRL price agent, the total travel time of the TN and the total operation costs of the PN are all reduced, and multi agent DDPG and TD3 algorithm have the best performance. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Massification of Electric vehicles (EVs) is becoming a worldwide reality as a means to combat climate change and local pollution. Considering that most of the time vehicles are in parking places, there is an opportunity for using EVs to provide some valuable services to the power network. In particular, EVs can provide ancillary services in electricity markets through an aggregating agent. To this end, EVs aggregators need to develop decision support tools to optimally allocate energy and regulation resources considering power network constraints. Unlike optimization models for EVs aggregators currently available in the literature, in this paper we propose an optimization approach for EVs aggregators that jointly considers the most important aspects influencing EVs profitability, such as uncertainty, drivers’ patterns, capacity constraints, state of charge constraints, regulation demand constraints, regulation offer constraints, regulation bounds constraints, and power-system security constraints. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, thus ensuring global optimality. Results are presented in the form of the hourly allocation for charging/discharging power profiles, distinguishing between day-ahead energy and capacity/energy for regulation, and the profit that can be reached, while accounting for network constraints. The proposed model is illustrated through a case study, which allows us to show that EVs aggregators allow for leading to a more reliable power system operation, avoiding transmission lines congestion, while providing important profits for EV owners who are able to provide regulation services. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Planning for multiple commodities simultaneously is a challenging task arising in divers applications, including robot motion or various forms of traffic management. Separation constraints between commodities frequently have to be considered to ensure safe trajectories, i.e., paths over time. Discrete decisions to ensure at least one of often multiple possible separation conditions renders planning of best possible continuous trajectories even more complex. Hence, the resulting disjoint trajectories optimization problems are mostly solved sequentially or with restricted planning space, potentially leading to losses in the usage of sparse resources and system capacities. To tackle these drawbacks, we develop a graph-based model for disjoint trajectories optimization with general separation requirements. We present a novel technique to derive a discretization for the full available space of motion. This can depict arbitrary, potentially non-convex, restricted areas. This necessitates solving an integer linear optimization program whose size scales with the number of discretization points. Thus, even for moderately sized instances a sufficiently detailed representation of space and time leads to models too large for state of the art hard- and software. To overcome this issue, we develop an adaptive-refinement algorithm: Starting from an optimal solution to the integer program in a coarse discretization, the algorithm re-optimizes trajectories in an adaptively-refined discretized neighborhood of the current solution. This is further integrated into a rolling horizon approach. We apply our approach to the integrated trajectory optimization and runway scheduling in the surrounding of airports. Computational experiments with realistic instances demonstrate the efficiency of the method. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The rise of battery-powered vehicles has led to many new technical and methodological hurdles. Among these, the efficient planning of an electric fleet to fulfill passenger transportation requests still represents a major challenge. This is because of the specific constraints of electric vehicles, bound by their battery autonomy and necessity of recharge planning, and the large scale of the operations, which challenges existing optimization algorithms. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a scalable column generation approach for routing and scheduling in this context. Our algorithm relies on four main ingredients: (i) a multigraph reformulation of the problem based on a characterization of nondominated charging arcs, (ii) an efficient bidirectional pricing algorithm using tight backward bounds, (iii) sparsification approaches permitting to decrease the size of the subjacent graphs dramatically, and (iv) a diving heuristic, which locates near-optimal solutions in a fraction of the time needed for a complete branch-and-price. Through extensive computational experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous algorithms for this setting, leading to accurate solutions for problems counting several hundreds of requests.  © 2023 INFORMS.},

	abstract = {Every day, railways experience disturbances and disruptions, both on the network and the fleet side, that affect the stability of rail traffic. Induced delays propagate through the network, which leads to a mismatch in demand and offer for goods and passengers, and, in turn, to a loss in service quality. In these cases, it is the duty of human traffic controllers, the so-called dispatchers, to do their best to minimize the impact on traffic. However, dispatchers inevitably have a limited depth of perception of the knock-on effect of their decisions, particularly how they affect areas of the network that are outside their direct control. In recent years, much work in Decision Science has been devoted to developing methods to solve the problem automatically and support the dispatchers in this challenging task. This paper investigates Machine Learning-based methods for tackling this problem, proposing two different Deep Q-Learning methods(Decentralized and Centralized). Numerical results show the superiority of these techniques respect to the classical linear Q-Learning based on matrices. Moreover the Centralized approach is compared with a MILP formulation showing interesting results. The experiments are inspired on data provided by a U.S. class 1 railroad. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

However, the considered problems are rarely solved by genetic algorithms (GAs), even though it has successfully solved various complicated combinatorial optimization problems. For the problem, we propose a trajectory-based immigration strategy, where immigrant generation is based on the given information of solution extraction knowledge matrices. We embed the immigration strategy into the GA method to improve the population’s diversification process. To examine the performance of the proposed GA method, two versions of GA methods (the GA without immigration and the GA method with random immigration) and a mixed integer programming (MIP) model are also developed. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GA method by comparing the MIP model with two versions of GA methods. Overall, the proposed GA method significantly outperforms the other GA methods regarding solution quality due to the trajectory-based immigration strategy. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In the context of carbon neutralization, the electric vehicle and energy storage market is growing rapidly. As a result, battery recycling is an important work with the consideration of the advent of battery retirement and resource constraints, environmental factors, resource regional constraints, and price factors. Based on the theoretical research of intelligent algorithm and mathematical models, an integer programming model of urban power battery reverse supply chain scheduling was established with the goal of the highest customer satisfaction and the least total cost of logistics and distribution, to study the influence of the resources and operation status of a built city recycling center and dismantling center on the power battery reverse supply chain. The model includes vehicle load, customer demand point satisfaction range, and service capacity constraints. This study collected regional image data, conducted image analysis, and further designed an improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) optimization algorithm suitable to solve the global optimization problem by introducing the improvement strategy of convergence rate, particle search, and the traditional elite individual retention. The results verified the practicability of the model, the global optimization ability of the algorithm to solve the problem, and the operation speed through comparing the results obtained from the basic algorithm. A reasonable comprehensive solution for the location and path optimization of the urban recycling center was also obtained. Multi-objective optimization was carried out in vehicle scheduling, facility construction, and customer satisfaction construction. The basic algorithm and integrated optimization software were compared. We found that the model and the scheme provided by the algorithm can significantly reduce the operation cost of the enterprise. This research provided new insights for enterprises to effectively utilize resources and optimize the reverse supply chain scheduling of an urban power battery. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The considerable increase in the complexity associated with the formulation of maintenance plans has enabled the development of new techniques to bring maintenance scheduling optimization models to more realistic environments. In this sense, a previous optimization model was proposed considering the use of time windows for the formation of grouping schemes under an opportunistic strategy for maintenance activities considering non-negligible execution times, thus offering the possibility of analysing scenarios with limited resources. This article proposes a risk analysis based on the failure probability of each component involved in the maintenance scheduling optimization model, which has the particularity of enabling a greater number of combinations of grouped PM activities. Moreover, it seeks to identify the general behaviour of the optimization model against different scenarios of periodicities and execution times of each maintenance activity. The proposed optimization model is formulated under a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) paradigm and its objective function seeks to minimize the unavailability of the system associated with the execution times of the activities developed, generating different experimental cases, and varying the start time scheduling under a tolerance factor from 0% up to a maximum of 25% for advance or delay. Results show in contrast with the base optimization model, an 8% less unavailability when the tolerance factor is 10%. Finally, it was possible to quantify the risk present in each maintenance schedule, at the same time a behaviour towards advancing PM activities is evidenced by the optimization model proposed over the delay.  © 2023 Pablo Viveros et al.},

Therefore, several methods have been developed to decrease the operating cost of such microgrids. In this paper, a new method considering the demand response has been developed to minimize the operating cost in microgrids integrated with renewables and ESSs. The demand response allows the operator and consumer to shift some of the load from the high-price periods to the low-price periods. In this case, the operating cost is minimized for operators and the bill prices decrease for consumers. The operating cost has decreased by 2.60% for a horizon of 24 hours and 3.72% for a horizon of one year. Also, there was a big reduction of the peak demand and standard deviation of the load profile of one year. The DR reduces the need to use the ESS to balance supply and demand. This results in increasing the ESS lifetime and leads to a big saving in ESS investment costs. The optimization problem has been solved using the mixed integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP) using the CPLEX solver in the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS).  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Owing to the different quantities and processing times of sub-lots, intermingling sub-lots with each other, instead of fixing the production sequence of sub-lots of a lot as in the existing studies, is a more practical approach to lot-streaming flow shops. Hence, a lot-streaming hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with consistent and intermingled sub-lots (LHFSP-CIS) was studied. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model was established, and a heuristic-based adaptive iterated greedy algorithm (HAIG) with three modifications was designed to solve the problem. Specifically, a two-layer encoding method was proposed to decouple the sub-lot-based connection. Two heuristics were embedded in the decoding process to reduce the manufacturing cycle. Based on this, a heuristic-based initialization is proposed to improve the performance of the initial solution; an adaptive local search with four specific neighborhoods and an adaptive strategy has been structured to improve the exploration and exploitation ability. Besides, an acceptance criterion of inferior solutions has been improved to promote global optimization ability. The experiment and the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test (p = 0) showed the significant advantages of HAIG in effectiveness and robustness compared with five state-of-the-art algorithms. An industrial case study verifies that intermingling sub-lots is an effective technique to enhance the utilization ratio of machines and shorten the manufacturing cycle. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {With the development of microgrids (MGs), an energy management system (EMS) is required to ensure the stable and economically efficient operation of the MG system. In this paper, an intelligent EMS is proposed by exploiting the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique. DRL is employed as the effective method for handling the computation hardness of optimal scheduling of the charge/discharge of battery energy storage in the MG EMS. Since the optimal decision for charge/discharge of the battery depends on its state of charge given from the consecutive time steps, it demands a full-time horizon scheduling to obtain the optimum solution. This, however, increases the time complexity of the EMS and turns it into an NP-hard problem. By considering the energy storage system’s charging/discharging power as the control variable, the DRL agent is trained to investigate the best energy storage control method for both deterministic and stochastic weather scenarios. The efficiency of the strategy suggested in this study in minimizing the cost of purchasing energy is also shown from a quantitative perspective through programming verification and comparison with the results of mixed integer programming and the heuristic genetic algorithm (GA). © 2022 by the authors.},

The data generated by the IoRT devices is collected by the UAVs, which immediately relay the data collected to an MEC device installed on the ground at a nearby location. The MEC device receives the data from the UAVs, and sends the results back to the UAVs, which in turn relay them to IoRT devices. We aim to minimize the energy consumption by the IoRT devices and the UAVs, while maximizing the system throughput subject to bandwidth, power, information-causality, and UAVs’ trajectory constraints. We formulate the problem as a Mixed Integer Non Linear Programming problem, which is a complex and non-convex optimization problem. To make the problem tractable, we use variable relaxation. We further develop an iterative algorithm based on Block Coordinate Descent method, to jointly optimize the connection scheduling, power control, bit transmission scheduling, bandwidth allocation, and trajectories of the UAVs. Numerical results demonstrate the convergence of the algorithm and superiority of the proposed model with respect to conventional methods. Our proposed system model of placing MEC at ground shows 9% improvement in energy consumption when compared to carrying out computations at MEC carried by UAV and a 99% improvement when compared to placing MEC at the satellite. The proposed system model shows a 0.2% lower system throughput on average, compared to placing MEC at UAV, which is tolerable considering gains in terms of energy consumption. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

These two models were further extended by adding resource calendar constraints named also availability constraints; this implies that the tasks should be scheduled only when the machine is available. The different proposed models were compared to each other on a set of generated benchmarks that reflect the specific properties of the industrial partner. Finally, as the studied configuration relies on practical real-world application, where thousands of orders are produced monthly, a novel dedicated heuristic was designed to address the need for quick solutions. The latter outperforms the other proposed algorithms for expected total tardiness minimization. The proposed problem can be readily modified to suit a wide range of real-world situations involving the scheduling of activities that share similar characteristics. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {We propose a solution method for the large-scale stochastic unit commitment (SUC) problem with weekly-dispatched energy storage and significant weather-dependent stochastic generating capacity. Weekly storage facilities that mostly charge during weekends and discharge during weekdays require a weekly scheduling of generating units, which result in a large-scale optimization problem. This SUC problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic model and we use the conditional value-at-risk as a risk measure. Using a Benders framework, the proposed solution method decomposes the problem into a mixed-integer linear master problem and linear and continuous subproblems. The master problem corresponds to the first-stage decisions throughout the week and includes all the commitment (binary) variables and their corresponding constraints. The subproblems correspond to the actual dispatch of the generating units on a weekly basis. Based on the success of column-and-constraint generation algorithms to solve robust optimization problems, we improve the low communication between the master problem and the subproblems in the standard Benders decomposition by adding primal variables and constraints from the subproblems to the master problem, which provides a better approximation of the recourse function. Our computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed decomposition method using an instance of the South Carolina synthetic system with 90 generating units under 40 scenarios. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the electricity retail market, the retailer company aims to determine the optimal time-of-use (ToU) prices to maximize profits resulting from buying energy in organized (long-term, day-ahead, balancing) markets and selling it to consumers. Therefore, the retailer should take into account the consumer's demand response actions to minimize the electricity bill in face of time varying prices. In this paper, this problem is formulated as a bilevel mixed-integer nonlinear programming model in which the retailer is the leader and the consumer is the follower. The consumer's problem encompasses the integrated optimization of all home energy resources, considering re-scheduling appliance operation, charging/discharging of electric vehicle and stationary batteries, local microgeneration and (buying and selling) exchanges with the grid. The accurate physical modelling of appliance operation to generate effective load scheduling solutions imposes a high computational burden. Two algorithms are proposed to address this problem: a deterministic bounding algorithm (DBA) using an optimal-value-function approach for bilevel optimization, and a hybrid meta-heuristic using a particle swarm optimization algorithm to tackle the upper-level problem that calls an exact mixed-integer linear programming solver to deal with the lower-level problem. In the framework of the DBA, three different techniques were implemented to deal with the nonlinearities arising from the products of integer and continuous variables (bilinear terms): 1) solving the (non-convex) subproblems of DBA using a mixed-integer nonlinear solver, 2) using the McCormick envelopes to approximate the bilinear terms by linear ones, and 3) expressing the integer variables by binary ones and linearizing the bilinear terms using an exact form. Computational experiments are presented and discussed for real data settings of the problem under study considering a computational budget to compare the different algorithms and techniques employed. The results showed that the DBA with the approximate linearization technique (2) leads to the best solutions. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Waiting time and idle time are among the main cost sources in production systems. They can also affect the feasibility of operations from a technological perspective; hence, both such times have to be kept as small as possible. This paper studies four single-objective variants of the permutation flowshop scheduling problem, where two objectives are considered: the weighted sum of the makespan and the core waiting time, and the weighted sum of the makespan and the core idle time. For each objective, both the problem with the assumption of semi-active solution and the one without it are considered. A general solution framework for tackling the above-mentioned problems is provided. First, two Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations (based on positional and precedence variables, respectively) and one Constraint Programming (CP) formulation are presented. Second, a MILP-based local search approach based on the positional MILP formulation and the concept of sliding windows are defined. An extensive set of computational experiments on benchmark instances show that the positional MILP formulation strongly outperforms the other two formulations in all the considered cases. The experiments also show that the sliding window local search heuristic achieves much better performances than other state-of-the-art local search heuristics. Indeed, it is able to improve the state-of-the-art in 2384 instances out of 2400. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The ambitious legislation driven by climate change, makes it necessary to focus more strongly on previously untapped greenhouse gas saving potentials, such as the mobile supply of renewable electrical energy which can create geographical flexibility. Consumers are supplied with electrical energy by the mobile energy system, whereby the energy can potentially come from the photovoltaic modules (PV), the diesel generator (DG), the fuel cell (FC) or the battery (EES) contained in the overall system. Exemplary customers of the service can be, e.g., road construction sites, festivals or other temporary events or also local distribution grid balancing applications. Given exogenous PV production and load profiles, this study determines the cost-optimal sizing of the system components (FC, DG, and EES) while deriving the optimal operating strategy for the overall system using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). In addition to investment and fuel costs, emission costs are integrated, which primarily occur in the context of DG operation. The model is implemented in Python in the optimisation environment Pyomo and solved by the Gurobi solver. The simulation is based on three scenarios for different combinations of PV production and load profiles as well as various hydrogen and emission price scenarios. It turns out, that the optimal sizes of the FC and the DG are between 0.5 and 2 kW for 60% and 0% demand coverage through PV respectively. For the battery, an optimal size between 1 and 4.8 kWh can be derived analogously. © 2023 The Authors},

The quality of routing and scheduling decisions is a function of the total operational cost, consisting of customers’ waiting time, and the operator's travel time, idle time and overtime. We propose and rigorously analyze a stochastic programming model and two distributionally robust optimization (DRO) models to solve the problem, assuming known and unknown service and travel time distributions, respectively. We consider two popular types of ambiguity sets for the DRO models: mean-support and 1-Wasserstein ambiguity sets. We derive equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) reformulations of both DRO models that can be implemented and efficiently solved using off-the-shelf optimization software, thereby enabling practitioners to use these models.

	abstract = {A multi-cell cluster-free NOMA framework is proposed, where both intra-cell and inter-cell interference are jointly mitigated via flexible cluster-free successive interference cancellation (SIC) and coordinated beamforming design. The joint design problem is formulated to maximize the system sum rate while satisfying the SIC decoding requirements and users' minimum data rate requirements. To address this highly complex and coupling non-convex mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), a novel distributed auto-learning graph neural network (AutoGNN) architecture is proposed to alleviate the overwhelming information exchange burdens among base stations (BSs). The proposed AutoGNN can train the GNN model weights whilst automatically optimizing the GNN architecture, namely the GNN network depth and message embedding sizes, to achieve communication-efficient distributed scheduling. Based on the proposed architecture, a bi-level AutoGNN learning algorithm is further developed to efficiently approximate the hypergradient in model training. It is theoretically proved that the proposed bi-level AutoGNN learning algorithm can converge to a stationary point. Numerical results reveal that: 1) the proposed cluster-free NOMA framework outperforms the conventional cluster-based NOMA framework in the multi-cell scenario; and 2) the proposed AutoGNN architecture significantly reduces the computation and communication overheads compared to the conventional convex optimization-based methods and the conventional GNNs with fixed architectures. © 1983-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Upon exploiting massive spectrum resources, millimeter-wave (mmW) communication can significantly improve the transmission rate of mobile-edge computing (MEC) offloading, whereas the directional mmW links are constrained by shrunk beam coverage and demand extra phase for beam alignment. To enhance the accessing efficiency, we develop the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme-based mmW MEC mechanism, namely, NOMA-mmW MEC, therefore motivating to minimize the average delay of the MEC offloading, by jointly optimizing the beamwidth, user equipment (UE) scheduling, and transmit power. To tackle the mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem of delay minimization, we develop the alternative optimization (AO) approach-based RA scheme, namely, AO-RA, to obtain the close-optimum solutions. In the AO-RA scheme, we propose the matrix control many-to-one with externality (MC-M2OE) algorithm, to find the best UE scheduling for the NOMA groupings of different types of UEs. Upon the above, we further design the joint beamwidth and transmit power (JBTP) algorithm, which determines the optimal beamwidth and transmit power for the MEC offloading transmissions. Our simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed AO-RA scheme in minimizing the offloading delay, where our MC-M2OE and JBTP algorithms can significantly outperform the existing approaches. From the simulation results, we may conclude that it needs to carefully address the tradeoff between beam alignment overhead and transmission gain while properly balancing the loading among different NOMA groups, for the practical consideration of NOMA-mmW MEC technology.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Charging piles in the bus depot provide charging services to multiple electric bus (EB) routes operating in the area. As charging needs may overlap between independently operated routes, EB fleets often have to wait in line for charging. However, affected by the ambient temperature, the length of the waiting time will cause the battery temperature to change at the beginning of each charging, thereby influencing the charging performance and charging time of the battery. To this end, this paper considers the influence of ambient temperature on battery charging performance, and collaboratively optimizes the number of charging piles in the bus depot and the scheduling problem of EB charging. Aiming at minimizing the cost of laying charging piles in bus stations and the charging costs of bus fleets, as well as minimizing the empty time of electric bus fleets and waiting time for charging in queues, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is established, and the immune algorithm is used to solve it. At last, an actual bus depot and four EB routes are taken as examples for verification. The results show that by optimizing the charging waiting time of the electric bus at the bus station, the rapid decline in charging performance caused by the sharp drop in battery temperature is avoided. Without increasing the charging cost of the electric bus fleet, the established method reduces the charging pile installation cost, improves the bus depot’s service efficiency, and ensures the punctuality and integrity of the regional bus route operation. © 2023 by the authors.},

FP-MEC is suited to meet Industrial Internet (IIN) requirements such as data privacy, low latency, and low-cost industrial scalability in specific scenarios. However, the reliability of virtual network functions (VNFs) deployed on UAVs could impact system performance. Thus, this paper proposes the dynamic task scheduling optimization algorithm (DTSOA) based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for resource allocation design. The formulated execution delay optimization problem is described as an integer linear programming problem and it is an NP-hard problem. To overcome the intractable problem, this paper discretizes it into a series of single-time slot optimization problems. Furthermore, the experimental rigor is improved by constructing a real-time server state update system to calculate the real-time server load situation and crash probability. Theoretical analysis and experiments show that the DTSOA has better application prospects than Q-learning and the recent search method (RSM), and it is closer to the traversal search method (TSM). © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The research of the mutli-UAV assisted NOMA networks has received a lot of attention because of its superior ability to improve spectrum efficiency and high maneuverability simultaneously. In this research, we take into account downlink NOMA networks with multiple tethered UAV assistance, and investigate the joint UAVs location, user scheduling, user pairing and power distribution problem. The design aims to maximize the sum-rate that can be achieved with a minimum rate restriction, as a complex problem involving mixed-integer programming. First, we determine the best user pairing and power distribution methods for established UAVs positions, which gives the closed-form solution for parameters. Afterwards, we formulate the UAV position optimization problem as a local altruistic game from the viewpoint of air-ground cooperation on the bias of interference graphs. It has been shown to be an exact potential game that permits more than one pure approach Nash equilibrium (PNE). A centralized-distributed iterative learning method is proposed to reach the ideal PNE as rapidly as possible, maximizing the specified network utility measure. The proposed algorithm performs better than the current techniques, according to simulation findings, and greatly boosts network utility. Simulation results show that, nearly 5% and 26% networks utility can be enhanced by the proposed method compared with ‘‘head-pairs-tail’’ and random schemes respectively. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Classification yards represent network nodes in the single-wagonload transport system. The processes are complex due to a high number of involved resources and restrictive dependencies. Decisions on job sequencing and resource allocation have a major impact on outbound delays and thus on the quality of service in the network. Due to permanent updates of arrival times and resource availabilities, a constant revision of decisions is necessary. In many cases, considering multiple qualifications of the personnel is crucial for efficient operations. This paper presents an approach for the rescheduling of processes and the assignment of resources in classification yards, which allows to determine best working schedules based on current data such that the cumulative outbound delay of all trains is minimized. Therefore, the paper presents a mixed integer program that includes all essential components (tracks, locomotives and personnel with individual skill patterns). For the real-time capable solution of the optimization problem, four different heuristic approaches based on priority rules are presented. The performance of these approaches is evaluated by a gap analysis with respect to the solutions found by CPLEX. For this purpose, real example data of an operation day of a large classification yard in Germany are used. © 2023 The Author(s)},

In order to alleviate the shortage of caregivers, this paper considers the scheduling problem of home health care, which includes the synchronous access of caregivers and vehicles, and the flexible marchingmatching between caregivers and patients. First of all, we construct a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to characterize the optimization problem. Secondly, an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with elite strategy (INSGA-II) is designed. The initial solution with high quality is obtained through the simultaneous evolution of two populations. The chromosomes are optimized by using improved crossover and mutation operators, and local search strategies are designed on this basis. Finally, several groups of test examples are used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm, and analyze the impact of different visit modes on objective function. The results show that the synchronous access can effectively reduce the costs, and can provide theoretical support for the medical center to make plans. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Using renewable energy sources (RES) and green hydrogen has increased dramatically as one of the best solutions to global environmental issues. Applying demand response programs (DRPs) in this context could enhance the system's efficiency. Evaluating different DRPs’ performances and assessing economic impacts on different parts of the electricity market is essential. The inherent uncertainty of RES and prices is inevitable in electricity markets. As a result of the lack of information, it is crucial to mitigate the risks as much as possible, such as risks related to changes in demand, unit outages, or other traders’ bid strategies. This research introduces a robust multi-objective optimization method to reach the most confident plan for the retailer based on uncertainty in RES and price. The integration of different DRPs is assessed according to the cost to retailers and benefits for consumers using a multi-objective model to survey the impacts of different parts’ decisions on each other. The trade-off among DRPs is considered in this model, and they are traded using a new model to illustrate the daily effect of these programs in monthly operations. This paper uses hydrogen storage (HS) integrated with PV as a distributed energy resource. As the Iranian electricity market has just been established, this research proposes a framework for decision-making in new electricity markets to join future smart energy systems. The mid-term pricing evaluates the system's performance for more accurate monthly results. Also, the operation cost of the hydrogen storage is modeled to assess its performance in non-robust and robust scheduling. Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has been used to model this problem in GAMS. A developed linearizing method is considered with a controllable amount of errors to reduce the volume and time of the computation. Finally, the cost of consumers in non-robust and robust market planning in the presence of DRPs is reduced by 8.77 % and 9.66 %, respectively, and HS has a compelling performance in peak-shaving and load-shifting. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

In the last few years, optimization solvers have gained attention from research communities due to their capability of handling large number of constraints. Recently, some works have used integer linear programming (ILP) for solving mono processor scheduling of real-time systems. In fact, ILP is commonly used for static scheduling of multiprocessor systems. However, two main solvers are used to solve the problem indistinctly. But, which one is the best for obtaining a schedulable system for hard real-time systems?

	abstract = {The increasing unmanned aircraft system (UAS) applications in urban environments pose challenges for safe and efficient low altitude air traffic management. As an essential enabler to meet these challenges, pre-flight 4D routes optimization is required to conduct conflict detection and resolution (CD&R) and to generate conflict-free flight routes before departure. Existing studies on strategic deconfliction cover several types of strategies such as scheduling or rerouting. However, a single type of strategy used to solve different types of conflicts may lead to an unsafe and inefficient way of conflict resolution. This paper proposes an adaptive decision-making framework to optimize the resolution strategies used for different types of conflicts with explainable mechanisms. The proposed framework is formulated as a double-layer optimization problem with the considerations of scheduling, speed adjustment, and rerouting strategies for conflict resolution. The first layer of the framework is established as a probabilistic selection model to make decisions on which strategy should be selected for what type of conflict. The second layer is developed as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model to optimize the decision variables of the strategies selected by the first layer. To solve the proposed double-layer optimization problem, we introduce and improve a novel meta-heuristic stochastic fractal search (SFS) algorithm with two major improvements of a penalty-guided fitness function and an exploitation-exploration balancing scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive conflict resolution framework successfully optimizes the strategies used for each type of flight conflict, which subsequently optimizes the 4D routes with significant reductions in total operational cost, number of flight conflicts, and flight delays. The improved stochastic fractal search (ISFS) algorithm is also proved effective and reliable in solving the proposed optimization problem in different traffic density scenarios. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Only one copy of each type of tools is made available due to economic restrictions, and the tools are stored in a central tool magazine (CTM) shared with and serves for several machines. The problem is to select machines from alternate machines for job-operations, allocation of tools to job-operations, and job-operations’ sequencing on machines for MS minimization. This paper presents a nonlinear mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation to model the combined scheduling of machines and tools with alternate machines and a symbiotic organisms search algorithm (SOSA) built on the symbiotic interaction strategies that organisms employ to continue to exist in the ecosystem for solving the scheduling of machines and tools with alternate machines. The results have been tabulated and analyzed. There will be reduction in MS when the alternate machines are considered for job-operation. © 2022 University of Kuwait. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study presents MANGOret (Multi-stAge eNerGy Optimization — retrofitting), a novel optimization framework and model for the long-term investment planning of existing building retrofits. MANGOret bridges the methodological gaps between energy system modeling and real estate management to present a scalable framework to optimize both energy and non-energy costs while considering building value. With a 2050 horizon, MANGOret is able to harness the strategic value of investment flexibility to optimally phase investments across the multi-objective cost and CO2 emission decision space considering both operational and embodied emissions. From the energy perspective, the model generates long-term investment strategies for decentralized multi-energy systems and envelope retrofits. The model considers the interdependent trade-offs between demand- and supply-side measures for a number of technologies across time. Technology scheduling is informed by condition degradation functions from utilizing the Schroeder method. From the real estate management perspective, the framework digitalizes the multi-year investment planning process. The model is supported by series of automated data retrieval and processing steps to consider each contextual building project. Importantly, we develop an archetypal energy demand database to reference demands of various retrofitting packages. By considering all retrofitting-relevant investments, the model incorporates the critical budgeting elements of rental revenues to calculate building value. We demonstrate the value of the MANGOret framework across various building types and sizes in different Swiss real estate markets. Our results demonstrate relevance for energy engineers and building owners relating to the long-term design, operation, and investment scheduling of existing buildings. We present multiple optimal strategies considering the trade-offs between cost, value, and CO2 emissions. Aligning with previous studies, our results show that higher investment costs are necessary to achieve low-CO2 retrofits relative to minimum cost strategies. Higher costs are, to a large extent, influenced by envelope retrofits and non-energy internal renovations while energy supply systems contribute to a smaller share of the budget. To achieve low-CO2, retrofits utilize lower embodied emission technology choices and are scheduled early on. Nevertheless, we show that these trade-offs do not necessarily have to be weighed at the extremes of the Pareto front, instead presenting ‘minimal regret’ solutions which reduce CO2 at negligible cost increases. Considering both embodied and operational CO2 emissions over the building life-cycle, our results demonstrate that optimal emission reductions necessitate subsequent reductions in energy consumption. Low-CO2 retrofitting strategies are typified by reducing energy demands as much as possible in order to self-consume as much renewable energy as possible, typically by solar PV and heat pump coupled systems with grid reliance. © 2022 The Authors},

Indeed, wireless sensor networks have received particular attention in recent years, as their applications are common today, such as vehicle tracking or battlefield monitoring. In a wireless sensor network, the sensor battery plays an important role. The function of the sensor depends on the battery life. Replacement of batteries becomes impossible once deployed in a remote or unattended location. A set of randomly placed sensors monitors targets moving in an area. Each sensor has a limited lifetime and two states: Active or Inactive. An active sensor can monitor targets in its monitoring sub-area at a necessary energy consumption cost. To model these problems, we use a mathematical model based on linear programming with mixed integer variables. AMPL is used to formulate the model and MINOS for its resolution and the numerical results allowed to obtain an adequate activation scheduling of the sensors by improving their lifetime. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Machine scheduling is a hard combinatorial problem having many manifestations in real life. Due to the schedule followed, the possibility of installations of machines operating sub-optimally is high. In this work, we examine the problem of a single machine with time-dependent capacity that performs jobs of deterministic durations, while for each job, its due time is known in advance. The objective is to minimize the aggregated tardiness in all tasks. The problem was motivated by the need to schedule charging times of electric vehicles effectively. We formulate an integer programming model that clearly describes the problem and a constraint programming model capable of effectively solving it. Due to the usage of interval variables, global constraints, a powerful constraint programming solver, and a heuristic we have identified, which we call the “due times rule”, the constraint programming model can reach excellent solutions. Furthermore, we employ a hybrid approach that exploits three local search improvement procedures in a schema where the constraint programming part of the solver plays a central role. These improvement procedures exhaustively enumerate portions of the search space by exchanging consecutive jobs with a single job of the same duration, moving cost-incurring jobs to earlier times in a consecutive sequence of jobs or even exploiting periods where capacity is not fully utilized to rearrange jobs. On the other hand, subproblems are given to the exact constraint programming solver, allowing freedom of movement only to certain parts of the schedule, either in vertical ribbons of the time axis or in groups of consecutive sequences of jobs. Experiments on publicly available data show that our approach is highly competitive and achieves the new best results in many problem instances. © 2022 by the authors.},

Subject to time windows and precedence constraints, each customer request is associated with a number of containers and must be served via a single body. Bodies are capacitated components that cannot move independently and must therefore be towed by a vessel. Bodies can be transferred between vessels at customer locations or transfer points in order to reduce overall costs. Vessels and bodies can end their routes at any location, meaning they do not need to return to a depot. Moreover, every vessel-body combination is permitted, which greatly expands the size of the solution search space. Although body transfers constitute a fundamental component of this real-world problem, the flexibility such transfers engender poses a huge logistical challenge to the human planners tasked with efficiently scheduling vessel routes. In this paper we model the VSBR as an optimization problem and introduce complementary approaches for solving it. We propose a mixed integer programming formulation and a heuristic approach with tailored neighborhoods for body transfers. To help stimulate further research, a set of instances is introduced based on real-world data and benchmarks are made publicly available. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Our approach combines an Integer Linear Program (ILP) that maximises the number of in-person consultations considering the effect of average early arrival and bridging times and a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) model to include the effect of waiting times due to randomness. We iteratively adapt our parameters in the ILP until the MCS model returns a 95% confidence interval of the number of patients in the waiting area that does not exceed its capacity. Our results reveal the impact of early arrival, bridging and waiting times on the number of in-person appointments that may be included in a blueprint schedule.

However, in integrated gas and electric power networks with a large share of intermittent renewable power supply, it is no longer straightforward to optimally predetermine the gas flow directions. A wrong predetermination of gas flow directions may result in feasible but not necessarily optimal schedules. We propose a mixed-integer linear optimization model to determine the optimal gas flow directions while scheduling the system. This unlocks additional flexibility to power systems, provided that a tight coordination between power and gas systems exists. The increased flexibility, although it comes at the cost of increased computational complexity, is quantified by comparing the total operational cost of the entire system with bidirectional gas flows as opposed to unidirectional gas flows. We numerically show that modeling gas flow directions as state variables may bring added value not only in the meshed but also in the radial gas networks. © 2022 The Authors},

A home requires energy management for home appliances, electric vehicles, energy storage systems, and renewable energy generation. The appliance scheduling problem is decomposed into smaller sequential decision problems that are easier to solve. Renewable generation is predicted and used to mitigate the influence of energy generation uncertainty.

	abstract = {We study a single trade ship routing and scheduling problem for a roll-on roll-off shipping company. Along the given trade, there is a number of contracts for transportation of cargoes between port pairs. Each contract states a minimum service frequency where the services should be evenly separated in time and possibly transit time requirements. Current planning practice is to visit all ports along the trade every time it is serviced. Here, we aim instead at determining the sailing route and schedule of each voyage along the trade, i.e., which ports to visit when, which contracts to serve, and the sailing speeds, so that all contract requirements are satisfied at minimum cost. To solve this problem, we have developed a three-phase MIP-based heuristic, where each phase consists of solving dedicated a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model. The heuristic constructs solutions by first identifying the most promising candidate routes along the trade. Next, a candidate route is allocated to each available vessel. Finally, the heuristic determines the allocation of cargoes between the vessels, as well as sailing speeds and arrival times. Computational tests show that the heuristic outperforms a commercial MIP-solver and provides high-quality solutions to realistically sized instances in reasonable time. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The notion of age of information (AoI) has become an important performance metric in network and control systems. Information freshness, represented by AoI, naturally arises in the context of caching. We address optimal scheduling of cache updates for a time-slotted system where the contents vary in size. There is limited capacity for the cache for making updates. Each content is associated with a utility function that depends on the AoI and the time duration of absence from the cache. For this combinatorial optimization problem, we present the following contributions. First, we provide theoretical results of problem tractability. Whereas the problem is NP-hard, we prove solution tractability in polynomial time for a special case where all contents have the same size, by a reformulation using network flows. Second, we derive an integer linear formulation for the problem, of which the optimal solution can be obtained for small-scale scenarios. Next, via a mathematical reformulation, we derive a scalable optimization algorithm using repeated column generation. In addition, the algorithm computes a bound of global optimum, that can be used to assess the performance of any scheduling solution. Performance evaluation of large-scale scenarios demonstrates the strengths of the algorithm in comparison to a greedy schedule. Finally, we extend the applicability of our work to cyclic scheduling.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

A rich literature concerning their design and optimisation is available, but mainly dedicated to integrated machining systems. This machine architecture is also implemented in the aluminium gravity die casting technology where the specificity of the casting process needs an appropriate design. In particular, the constraints related to processing times and the rigidity of the production sequence impose a specific approach to schedule the production for achieving an optimal cycle time. We approach this problem with an optimisation perspective: first we propose a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for defining the sequencing and scheduling of the machine in order to obtain a specified production with minimum makespan, and discuss strategies for enumerating the variables of the formulation. Second, we describe a heuristic algorithm as an alternative to the solution of the formulation through a general-purpose solver. Eventually, we present extensive computational experiments on a set of instances generated from real data, comparing these alternative approaches. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

In this paper we consider the minimization of both the makespan and the energy consumption in the classical job shop scheduling problem. The energy model considered allows several possible states for the machines: off, stand-by, idle, setup and processing. To solve this multi-objective problem we propose an NSGA-II based evolutionary algorithm combined with local search and a heuristic procedure to improve the energy consumption of a given schedule. We also propose an advanced constraint programming (CP) approach as well as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, to the aim of comparing their performances against those obtained with the NSGA-II. The experimental study is performed against a benchmark set that extends by 41 instances of increasing size, the set tackled in the previous literature against the same problem. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of the NSGA-II algorithm over all other methods, despite the utilization of CP and MILP allows to draw interesting conclusions on the overall solution optimality, revealing that there is still room for further optimization. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

In this paper, we propose a fifth generation (5G) and satellite converged network architecture for power transmission and distribution scenarios, where power transmission and distribution devices (PDs) can choose to forward power data to a cloud server data center via ground networks or space-based networks for power grid regulation and control. We propose a Joint Device Association and Power Control Online Optimization (JDAPCOO) algorithm to maximize the long-term system energy efficiency while guaranteeing the minimum transmission rate requirement of PDs. Since the formulated issue is a mixed integer nonconvex optimization problem with high complexity, we decompose the original problem into two subproblems, i.e., device association and power control, which are solved using a genetic algorithm and improved simulated annealing algorithm, respectively. Numerical simulation results show that when the number of PDs is 50, the proposed algorithm can improve the system energy efficiency by 105%, 545.05% and 835.26%, respectively, compared with the equal power allocation algorithm, random power allocation algorithm and random device association algorithm. © 2022 by the authors.},

A broad range of interrelated scheduling and routing operations and various synchronization aspects of heterogeneous vehicles are considered in this regard. A novel bi-objective mixed-integer programming model is presented, where the first objective function aims to minimize the total costs of the relief logistics network, and the second one minimizes the total operation times of vehicles. Moreover, due to extensive empirical and analytical errors, preliminary travel and service times are inexact and unreliable. Hence, a novel two-stage data-driven approach is rendered to predict reliable travel and service times. In the first stage, a new hybrid machine learning model is rendered to predict these times, and in the second stage, the distributionally robust optimization with φ-divergence is employed to surmount the unreliability of predicted times. A real case study is examined to illustrate the validity of the proposed model and solution approach. In addition, several simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution method in terms of robustness. Finally, the proposed framework can improve the planning by rendering meaningful insights concerning significant parameters' influence over the schedule and routing consequences. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

This article proposes a multiobjective network-constrained framework for the day-ahead scheduling of hydrogen systems (HS), including hydrogen production from water electrolysis by electrolyzers, hydrogen storage, stationary fuel cells, and fueling of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). This framework includes various physical constraints to ensure reliable operation and considers integrated demand response and conservation voltage reduction, and reactive power support from HSs for realistic day-ahead scheduling. It also incorporates the cooperative operation of PV units and HSs to supply power for water electrolysis from stationary HSs equipped with onsite PVs. Moreover, conditional value-at-risk is applied to address the risk of PV output, FCEVs' H2 demand, loads, and market price.

This paper presents a method to fine-tune the periodic timetable to improve the utilization of regenerative energy and to shave power peaks while maintaining the structure and robustness of the original timetable. First, a mixed-integer linear programming model based on the periodic event scheduling framework is proposed. A set of feasible timetables is determined and optimized with the aim of increasing synchronized acceleration and braking events at the same station, and maintaining the timetable robustness at the specified level. Next, a local search algorithm is developed to optimize the timetable such that the power peak value is minimized. The max-plus system model is adopted to estimate the delay propagation. Monte Carlo simulation is used to evaluate the utilization of regenerative energy and power peaks in random delayed circumstances. The proposed method was adopted to fine-tune the 2019 timetable for a sub-network of the Dutch railway. In the case of on- time scenarios, the optimized timetable increases the regenerative energy usage by almost 290% and decreases the 15-minute power peaks by 8.5%. In the case of delay scenarios, the optimized timetable outperforms the original timetable in terms of using regenerative energy and shaving power peaks.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

Reliable load aggregation is critical for LSEs to improve profits in electricity markets. Due to the uncertainty, the actual aggregated response of loads obtained by conventional aggregation methods can experience significant deviations from the bidding value, making it difficult for LSEs to develop an optimal bidding and scheduling strategy. In this paper, a bi-level scheduling model is proposed to maximize the net revenue of the LSE from optimal DR bidding and energy storage systems ESS scheduling by considering the impacts of the uncertainty of demand response. An online learning method is adopted to improve aggregation reliability. Additionally, the net profit for LSEs can be raised by strategically switching ESS between two modes, namely, energy arbitrage and deviation mitigation. With Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) optimality condition-based decoupling and piecewise linearization applied, this bi-level optimization model can be reformulated and converted into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method are verified in a modified IEEE RTS-24 bus system. © 2022 The Author(s)},

The network can consist of multiple river segments, connected by a set of locks, without restrictions on the configuration. To allow scalability towards realistic waterway networks, we also propose a local-search based heuristic to optimize the speed for individual vessels. We evaluate the effectiveness of the heuristic by comparing it to solving the exact mathematical programming formulation. For all computational experiments, we make use of real AIS data from a section of the Dutch river network. We observe that the heuristic is able to construct a high quality solution in realistic problem settings within reasonable amount of computation time. © 2021},

	abstract = {The energy transition into a modern power system requires energy flexibility. Demand Response (DR) is one promising option for providing this flexibility. With the highest share of final energy consumption, the industry has the potential to offer DR and contribute to the energy transition by adjusting its energy demand. This paper proposes a mathematical optimization model that uses a generic data model for flexibility description. The optimization model supports industrial companies to select when (i.e., at which time), where (i.e., in which market), and how (i.e., the schedule) they should market their flexibility potential to optimize profit. We evaluate the optimization model under several synthetic use cases developed upon the learnings over several workshops and bilateral discussions with industrial partners from the paper and aluminum industry. The results of the optimization model evaluation suggest the model can fulfill its purpose under different use cases even with complex use cases such as various loads and storages. However, the optimization model computation time grows as the complexity of use cases grows. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Training deep learning (DL) models in the cloud has become a norm. With the emergence of serverless computing and its benefits of true pay-as-you-go pricing and scalability, systems researchers have recently started to provide support for serverless-based training. However, the ability to train DL models on serverless platforms is hindered by the resource limitations of today's serverless infrastructure and DL models' explosive requirement for memory and bandwidth. This paper describes FuncPipe, a novel pipelined training framework specifically designed for serverless platforms that enable fast and low-cost training of DL models. FuncPipe is designed with the key insight that model partitioning can be leveraged to bridge both memory and bandwidth gaps between the capacity of serverless functions and the requirement of DL training. Conceptually simple, we have to answer several design questions, including how to partition the model, configure each serverless function, and exploit each function's uplink/downlink bandwidth. In particular, we tailor a micro-batch scheduling policy for the serverless environment, which serves as the basis for the subsequent optimization. Our Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming formulation automatically and simultaneously configures serverless resources and partitions models to fit within the resource constraints. Lastly, we improve the bandwidth efficiency of storage-based synchronization with a novel pipelined scatter-reduce algorithm. We implement FuncPipe on two popular cloud serverless platforms and show that it achieves 7%-77% cost savings and 1.3X-2.2X speedup compared to state-of-the-art serverless-based frameworks.  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {In many European metropolitan areas, the urban transit system is a mixture of schedule- and frequency-based services. This study proposes an integrated transit frequency and schedule design problem (ITFSDP), where frequencies and schedules are simultaneously determined, and develops a biobjective model for the ITFSDP to minimize operation costs and total passenger-perceived generalized travel cost. Meanwhile, the passengers' route choice behavior is described by the bounded stochastic user equilibrium (BSUE). The in-vehicle congestion effect is represented using a set of constraints that differ in terms of the sitting and standing costs as sitting and standing passengers perceive crowding differently. This set of constraints captures the realistic behavioral feature that having occupied a seat, users remain seated at subsequent stops in the same vehicle. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, which is subsequently linearized to a mixed integer linear programming problem and solved using a branch and bound algorithm. A column generation and reduction phase is embedded in the solution algorithm to obtain the bounded choice set according to the BSUE constraints. Experiments are conducted to illustrate the model's properties and the performance of the solution method. In particular, we demonstrate a Braess-like paradoxical phenomenon in the context of transit scheduling and highlight that well-synchronized transit services can deteriorate the network performance in terms of the total passengers' generalized travel cost when considering passenger congestion costs because of crowding. © 2022 INFORMS.},

	abstract = {Power systems are shifted from conventional bulk generation toward renewable generation. This trend leads to the frequency security problem due to the decline of system inertia. On the other hand, natural gas-fired units are frequently scheduled to provide operational flexibility due to their fast adjustment ability. The interdependence between the power system and natural gas system is thus intensified. In this context, this paper considers the frequency constrained scheduling problem from the perspective of an integrated electricity-gas system under wind power uncertainty. A distributionally robust (DR) joint chance-constrained optimization model is proposed to co-optimize the unit commitment and virtual inertia provision from wind farm systems. This model incorporates both frequency constraints and natural gas system (NGS) operational constraints and addresses the wind power uncertainty by designing DR joint chance constraints. It is shown that this model admits a mixed-integer second-order cone programming. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method can provide a highly reliable and computationally efficient solution and show the importance of incorporating NGS operational constraints in the frequency constrained scheduling problem.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The paper provides a comprehensive battery storage modeling approach, which accounts for operation- and degradation-aware characteristics and can be used in optimization problem formulations. Particularly, Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) compatible models have been developed for the lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) battery storage using the Special Order Sets 2 to represent the nonlinear characteristics, including efficiency, internal resistance growth, and capacity fade. Such formulation can be used in problems related to various applications, i.e., power systems, smart grid, and vehicular applications, and it allows finding the globally optimal solution using off-the-shelf academic and commercial solvers. In the numerical study, the proposed modeling approach has been applied to realistic scenarios of peak-shaving, where the importance of considering the developed models is explicitly demonstrated. Operation- and degradation-aware techno-economic analysis showed that the optimal battery capacity is driven by operating rather than service requirements. Particularly, a considerable battery over-sizing becomes economically feasible when the battery storage is used more extensively. Another finding suggests that to achieve the maximum value from battery storage, its operation strategy needs to be significantly modified during the course of its lifetime. In the scenarios considered, the charging time gradually increased from four to seven hours, while the average SoC decreased by 20%. Such an adaptable scheduling results in reduced battery degradation and a longer lifetime, which may provide as much as 12.1% of savings in the battery storage system project. © 2022 The Authors},

In the transit network, passenger flow between urban-rural corridors demonstrates directional imbalances and low utilization of scarce resources. Freight transportation, on the other hand, lags due to poor geography, high operating costs, and scattered demand. This paper proposes a new mode of public transit that integrates passenger and freight transport, providing a carrier for logistics while compensating for the low utilization of passenger transport. In this mode, each timetabled round trip is divided into one dedicated passenger trip with high demand and one mixed-flow trip with on-demand requests. A space-time-state network is constructed considering the picking-up time window, loading/unloading service time, and electric bus energy replenishment. A mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to optimize the bus schedule that covers the travel demands and the charging requests with minimized travel costs. A Lagrangian relaxation framework with a dynamic programming algorithm and sub-gradient method is presented for problem-solving. The real-life rural-urban transport instance and a simulated network demonstrate the operation of the new mode and validate the efficiency of the proposed method. The innovative concept and the optimization framework are expected to serve as a reference for public administration to alleviate passenger and freight transportation bottlenecks in the urban-rural context.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The present work refers to two current problems in the context of achieving Greenhouse gas (GHG) neutrality: first the curtailment of renewable, volatile power generation units and secondly the high share of the mobility domain in total GHG-emissions. Both problems can be countered by a decentralised, smart energy system that supplies electricity, gas and heat to a hybrid public transport bus fleet and is simultaneously coupled to the public gas grid, public electricity grid and the district heating grid (Multi-Grid-Coupling). The enabling energy conversion unit is a reversible solid oxide cell (rSOC), which is operated in combined heat and power (CHP) mode or in power-to-gas (P2G) mode. P2G is primarily a solution approach for the first-mentioned problem and can thus successively lead to the replacement of fossil energy sources. Furthermore, by integrating industrial waste gases – as a necessary CO2 source for the P2G process – an additional benefit is gained from the CO2 that is emitted anyhow. The hybrid bus fleet constitutes an ecological alternative concept in public transport and therefore addresses the second-mentioned problem. The system, developed under the current state of the art technologies and the current ecological and economic conditions for Europe and Germany, can be operated profitably from the perspective of the system operator. This applies to the economically and ecologically optimised operating schedule of the controllable system elements such as the electrical, thermal and compressed gas storages, rSOC, compressor and the energy exchange with the public grids. To derive the optimal operating schedule of the cross-sectoral system, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is implemented and simulated under the current legal situation. © 2022 The Authors},

Nonetheless, non-ideal communication links and limited transmission resources may hinder the implementation of fast and accurate FL. In this paper, we study joint optimization of communications and FL based on analog aggregation transmission in realistic wireless networks. We first derive closed-form expressions for the expected convergence rate of FL over the air, which theoretically quantify the impact of analog aggregation on FL. Based on the analytical results, we develop a joint optimization model for accurate FL implementation, which allows a parameter server to select a subset of workers and determine an appropriate power scaling factor. Since the practical setting of FL over the air encounters unobservable parameters, we reformulate the joint optimization of worker selection and power allocation using controlled approximation. Finally, we efficiently solve the resulting mixed-integer programming problem via a simple yet optimal finite-set search method by reducing the search space. Simulation results show that the proposed solutions developed for realistic wireless analog channels outperform a benchmark method, and achieve comparable performance of the ideal case where FL is implemented over error-free wireless channels.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As decentralized energy supply units, microgrids can make a decisive contribution to achieving climate targets. In this context, it is particularly important to determine the optimal size of the energy components contained in the microgrids and their optimal operating schedule. Hence, mathematical optimization methods are often used in association with such tasks. In particular, mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has proven to be a useful tool. Due to the versatility of the different energetic components (e.g., storages, solar modules) and their special technical characteristics, linear relationships can often only inadequately describe the real processes. In order to take advantage of linear solution techniques but at the same time better represent these real-world processes, accurate and efficient approximation techniques need to be applied in system modeling. In particular, nonlinear-bivariate functions represent a major challenge, which is why this paper derives and implements a method that addresses this issue. The advantage of this method is that any bivariate mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation can be transformed into a MILP formulation using this comprehensive method. For a performance comparison, a mixed-integer quadratic constrained programming (MIQCP) model—as an MINLP special case—is applied and transformed into a MILP, and the solution of the transformed problem is compared with the one of the MIQCP. Since there are good off-the-shelf solvers for MIQCP problems available, the comparison is conservative. The results for an exemplary microgrid sizing task show that the method delivers a strong performance, both in terms of approximation error (0.08%) and computation time. The method and its implementation can serve as a general user-tool but also as a basis for further methodological developments and research. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {We study elective surgery planning in flexible operating rooms (ORs) where emergency patients are accommodated in the existing elective surgery schedule. Specifically, elective surgeries can be scheduled weeks or months in advance. In contrast, an emergency surgery arrives randomly and must be performed on the day of arrival. Probability distributions of the actual durations of elective and emergency surgeries are unknown, and only a possibly small set of historical realizations may be available. To address distributional uncertainty, we first construct an ambiguity set that encompasses all possible distributions of surgery durations within a 1-Wasserstein distance from the empirical distribution. We then define a distributionally robust surgery assignment (DSA) problem to determine optimal elective surgery assignment decisions to available surgical blocks in multiple ORs, considering the capacity needed for emergency cases. The objective is to minimize the total cost consisting of the fixed cost related to scheduling or rejecting elective surgery plus the maximum expected cost associated with OR overtime and idle time over all distributions defined in the ambiguity set. Using the DSA model's structural properties, we derive an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) reformulation that can be implemented and solved efficiently using off-the-shelf optimization software. In addition, we extend the proposed model to determine the number of ORs needed to serve the two competing surgery classes and derive a MILP reformulation of this extension. We conduct extensive numerical experiments based on real-world surgery data, demonstrating our proposed model's computational efficiency and superior out-of-sample operational performance over two state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, we derive insights into surgery scheduling in flexible ORs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Security constrained unit commitment is an essential part of the day-ahead energy markets. The presence of discrete and continuous variables makes it a complex, mixed-integer, and time-hungry optimization problem. Grid operators solve unit commitment problems multiple times daily with only minor changes in the operating conditions. Solving a large-scale unit commitment problem requires considerable computational effort and a reasonable time. However, the solution time can be improved by exploiting the fact that the operating conditions do not change significantly in the day-ahead market clearing. Therefore, in this paper, a novel multi-layer data-driven approach is proposed, which significantly improves the solution time (90% time-reduction on average for the three studied systems). The proposed approach not only provides a near-optimal solution (<1% optimality gap) but also ensures that it is feasible for the stable operation of the system (0% infeasible predicted solutions). The efficacy of the developed algorithm is demonstrated through numerical simulations on three test systems, namely a 4-bus system and the IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems, and promising results are obtained. © 2022 by the authors.},

The CARS strategy aims to maximise the tracking performance of MRS, whilst minimising the interference from MRS to communication systems (CSs), whose mechanism is to simultaneously control the revisit frame interval of each target and determine the activation of radar nodes, the radar-target assignment and the allocation of transmitted power. Mathematically, the CARS strategy is formulated as an optimization problem, which contains both the continuous variable and the discrete (integer) variable. To tackle the resultant mixed-integer, non-convex, and non-linear problem efficiently, incorporating with the proposed hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm based on the Kullback–Leibler divergence, a two-stage solution technique is developed to obtain the near-optimal solution. Numerical simulation results are provided to validate the proposed CARS strategy and demonstrate its superiority over the traditional scheduling strategies. © 2022 The Authors.

A battery level-aware task-scheduling framework is proposed to improve the energy efficiency and prolong the operating hours of battery-powered mobile devices. The formulated optimization problem is a typical mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. To solve this nondeterministic polynomial (NP)-hard problem, a decomposition-based task-scheduling algorithm is proposed. Using an alternating optimization technology, the original problem is divided into three subproblems. In the outer loop, task offloading decisions are yielded using a pruning search algorithm for the task offloading subproblem. In the inner loop, closed-form solutions for computational resource allocation subproblems are derived using the Lagrangian multiplier method. Then, it is proven that the transmitted power-allocation subproblem is a unimodal problem; this subproblem is solved using a gradient-based bisection search algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves better energy efficiency than other frameworks. Additionally, the impact of the battery level-aware scheme on the operating hours of battery-powered mobile devices is also investigated. 1225-6463/$ © 2022 ETRI.},

	abstract = {High penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES) and unexpected disruptions (e.g., natural disasters) are fundamental challenges which can threaten the secure operation of microgrids, especially during the islanded condition, with no support from the upstream grid. This paper introduces a hierarchical tri-layer min-max-min joint risk- and security-constrained model predictive control (RSC-MPC) framework for real-time energy scheduling of islanded microgrids (IMGs) under the influence of uncertainty and real-time time-varying contingency conditions. While the first layer processes a pre-scheduling day-ahead optimisation, the second layer detects the worst-case contingency conditions by maximising the load curtailment and the mismatch between pre-scheduling (i.e., first layer) and real-time operation. The third layer implements the corrective security measures to minimise the negative effect of contingency conditions while accounting to the cost associated with the risk of uncertainty in the forecasted inputs. The third layer also explores the economic effects of the RES' uncertainty on the proposed RSC-MPC, considering the risk and energy procurement cost as conflicting objectives. The computational efficiency of the proposed hierarchical control system in terms of accuracy and processing time is guaranteed through a mixed integer conic programming model. The proposed RSC-MPC is tested in different case studies and its efficiency is validated by numerical results.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new problem in the field of production planning, called the production leveling problem. The task is to assign orders to production periods such that the load in each period and for each product type is balanced, capacity limits are not exceeded, and the orders’ priorities are taken into account. Production leveling is an important intermediate step between long-term planning and the final scheduling of orders within a production period, as it is responsible for selecting good subsets of orders to be scheduled within each period. We provide a formal model of the problem and study its computational complexity. As an exact method for solving moderately sized instances, we introduce a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation. For solving large problem instances, metaheuristic local search is investigated. A greedy heuristic and two neighborhood structures for local search are proposed in order to apply them using simulated annealing. Furthermore, three possible extensions that arise from the application in practice are described and implemented, both within the MIP model and within simulated annealing. We make publicly available a set of realistic problem instances from the industry as well as from random instance generators. The experimental evaluation on our test sets shows that the proposed MIP model is well suited for solving instances with up to 250 orders. Simulated annealing produces solutions with less than 3 % average optimality gap on small instances, and scales well up to thousands of orders and dozens of periods and product types. The metaheuristic method presented herein is already being successfully used in the industry. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {As an essential part of the future national energy system, hydrogen energy has the advantages of clean, long-time scale energy storage and good complementary characteristics to electrical power, making it an important player in the low-carbon transformation of energies. However, the long timescale storage characteristics and tradability of hydrogen energy are rarely considered in existing capacity allocation optimization methods for hydrogen integrated energy systems(HIES). Meanwhile, the impact of the physical characteristics of the hydrogen storage equipment is rarely considered in the construction of HIES. Therefore, this paper proposes a new capacity allocation method for HIES in industrial park considering hydrogen trading and long-term hydrogen storage. The proposed capacity allocation optimization method is a bilevel mixed-integer linear programming model, which is solved by the reconfiguration decomposition algorithm. The nonlinear constraint problem due to the physical characteristics of the hydrogen storage device is solved by the Big-M method and the binary method. The proposed method can effectively improve the economy of HIES and reduce the cost of hydrogen production. Meanwhile, the reconstruction decomposition algorithm can effectively solve the bilevel mixed integer programing model. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce hydrogen production economics by 28%. Considering hydrogen trading, the total investment and operating cost of HIES is reduced by 25%, while long-term hydrogen storage can reduce the cost of hydrogen production for HIES and reduce the impact of hydrogen trading fluctuations.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This study examined the flexible assembly job-shop scheduling problem with lot streaming (FAJSP-LS), common in multivariety and small-batch production, such as household electrical appliances. In FAJSP-LS, an assembly stage is appended to the flexible job shop, and jobs in the first stage are processed in a large batch to reduce switching costs, while leading to more waiting time, especially during the assembly stage. This article considered splitting the batch into a few sub-batches of unequal and consistent sizes to allow jobs to efficiently pass the two-stage system. With this objective, the problem was modeled as a mixed-integer linear program comprising the following two subproblems: batch splitting and batch scheduling. As the integrated problem is NP-hard, the improved bioinspired algorithm based on an artificial bee colony was proposed, including a four-layer chromosome–encoding structure to describe the solution, as well as an optimization strategy utilizing different bee colonies to synchronously solve this two-stage problem. To examine the algorithm’s efficiency, a benchmark case was used to show that better solutions can be acquired with the improved algorithm regardless of whether the batch was split into equal or unequal sizes. To promote practical implementation, the algorithm was applied to a real case refrigerator workshop and showed better performance on time efficiency when jobs were split into unequal sizes compared to jobs without splitting or splitting into equal sizes.

	abstract = {In the context of the increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy resources (RES), one of the significant challenges facing traditional bulk power systems and microgrids is the scheduling generation units problem. Many studies have focused on solving the energy management problem for microgrids integrating RES. To address the intermittency caused by RES, flexible components such as battery energy storage systems (BESS) or demand response (DR) are considered. To clarify the problem of integrating these flexible components, a mixed-integer programming (MIP) approach for the unit commitment (UC) problem for microgrids with BESS and DR is proposed in this paper. An incentive-based demand response model as a negative power source and a detailed model for the vanadium redox battery (VRB) are introduced to improve the efficiency and reliability of microgrids. The objective optimization function, including the costs of generation, emissions, and maintenance, is minimized considering the uncertainty of the load and renewable energy sources. The obtained simulation results are compared with the genetic algorithm (GA) method as the basis for verification in different case studies. The obtained results have clarified the effect of using the BESS model and DR program on system operation. © 2022 by the authors.},

These strategies include: (ⅰ) the proposal of a decoding method based on dynamic programming, (ⅱ) the design of dynamic probability crossover and mutation operators, and (ⅲ) the presentation of neighborhood search method. The parameters of the proposed algorithm are optimized by the Taguchi method. Three scales of problems, including 52 instances, are generated to compare the performance of different optimization methods.

	abstract = {Commercial flights nearly halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the second quarter of 2020. Consequently, several countries have had to schedule repatriation flights to return their citizens stranded in other countries. Flight routes and schedules are known in normal circumstances, and passengers buy seats on these flights; however, the reverse steps happen in repatriation. Passengers express their need to travel, and flights are scheduled to satisfy their requests. The problem behind this flight schedule can be called the repatriation scheduling problem (RSP), in which we need to repatriate citizens from different countries. The objective of the RSP is to return the most vulnerable citizens first. The capacity of available airplanes and quarantine locations limit the number of repatriated citizens. To address this problem, we have developed a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to model the RSP. Moreover, we suggest a basic variable neighbourhood search (BVNS) algorithm to solve the problem. We test the BVNS algorithm by creating and solving a set of 108 RSP instances and then comparing the BVNS solutions with the exact ones. Despite allocating only 20 s to run the BVNS algorithm compared to eight hours for a commercial exact solver's branch and bound algorithm, the BVNS algorithm could find better results than the lower bounds for 62 instances and similar values for 17 instances. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Vehicular edge computing (VEC) has emerged in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) as a new paradigm that offloads computation tasks to Road Side Units (RSU), aiming to thereby reduce the processing delay and resource consumption of vehicles. Ideal computation offloading policies for VEC are expected to achieve both low latency and low energy consumption. Although existing works have made great contributions, they rarely consider the coordination of multiple RSUs and the individual Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of different applications, resulting in suboptimal offloading policies. In this paper we present FEVEC, a Fast and Energy-efficient VEC framework, with the objective of realizing an optimal offloading strategy that minimizes both delay and energy consumption. FEVEC coordinates multiple RSUs and considers the application-specific QoS requirements. We formalize the computation offloading problem as a multi-objective optimization problem by jointly optimizing offloading decisions and resource allocation, which is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and NP-hard. We propose MOV, a Multi-Objective computing offloading method for VEC. First, vehicle prejudgment is proposed to meet the requirements of different applications by considering the maximum tolerance delay related to the current vehicle speed. Second, an improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is adopted to obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions with low complexity. Finally, the optimal offloading strategy is selected for QoS maximization. Extensive evaluation results based on real and simulated vehicle trajectories verify that the average QoS value of MOV is improved by 20% compared with the state-of-the-art VEC mechanism. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Due to its proactive impact on the serviceability of components in a system, preventive maintenance plays an important role particularly in systems of geographically spread infrastructure such as utilities networks in commercial buildings. What makes such systems differ from the classical schemes is the routing and technicians' travel times. Besides, maintenance in commercial buildings is characterized by its short tasks’ durations and spatial distribution within and between different buildings, a class of problems that has not been suitably investigated. Although it is not trivial to assign particular duties solely to multi-skilled teams under limited time and capacity constraints, the problem becomes more challenging when travel routes, durations and service levels are considered during the execution of the daily maintenance tasks. To address this problem, we propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming Model that considers the above settings. The model exact solution recommends collaborative choices that include the number of maintenance teams, the selected tasks, routes, tasks schedules, all detailed to days and teams. The model will reduce the cost of labor, replacement parts, penalties on service levels and travel time. The optimization model has been tested using different maintenance scenarios taken from a real maintenance provider in the UAE. Using CPLEX solver, the findings demonstrate an inspiring time utilization, schedules of minimal routing and high service levels using a minimum number of teams. Different travel speeds of diverse assortment of tasks, durations and cost settings have been tested for further sensitivity analysis. © 2022 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.},

	abstract = {Chance-constrained optimization (CCO) has been widely used for uncertainty management in power system operation. With the prevalence of wind energy, it becomes necessary to consider wind curtailment as a dispatch variable in CCO. However, the wind curtailment will cause an impulse for the uncertainty distribution, yielding challenges for explicit modeling of chance constraint. In this paper, a novel data-driven framework is developed to handle this issue. By modeling the wind curtailment as a cap enforced on the wind power output, the proposed framework constructs a data-driven surrogate to describe the relationship between wind curtailment and the tightening boundary of chance constraints. This allows us to reformulate the CCO with wind curtailment as a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MI-SOCP) problem. An error correction strategy is developed by solving a convex linear programming (LP) to improve the modeling accuracy. The notable characteristic of the proposed method is that the chance constraints with wind curtailment can be explicitly and accurately handled without any distribution assumptions, which provides great convenience for the power dispatch under a high percentage of renewables. Case studies performed on the PJM 5-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of accurately accounting the influence of wind curtailment dispatch in CCO. It shows that the proposed method outperforms existing methods by producing more economic and secure solutions for the chance-constrained energy and reserve scheduling problem under uncertainties. © 2022},

	abstract = {This paper identifies the underlying physical mechanisms that frame the flexibility and operation of nuclear technologies, with analysis focused on the effects of two structural characteristics of nuclear fleets, i.e. nuclear schedule optimization and minimal power variations, on simplified French power system simulations. We develop a method to simulate nuclear schedule optimization to reflect how plant managers maximize plant availability during peak-demand periods. Using this schedule optimization, we compute each plant's minimum power level and its variation over time to evaluate the flexibility potential. Three nuclear flexibility hypotheses are considered: one where fleet schedule is considered constant, which is standard practice in the energy systems modeling literature, one with an optimized fleet schedule with constant minimum power, and one with an optimized fleet schedule with physics-induced minimum power variations. Sensitivity analysis highlights the links between the fleet's schedule optimization, minimal power variations, relative share of nuclear and renewables in the capacity mix, and results of simulation models. We find that the nuclear fleet's optimization and associated realistic minimum power variations gain in importance with increasing relative share of nuclear in the capacity mix. The schedule's importance holds as renewables' installed capacities heighten as the residual demand level decreases. This paper highlights the potential benefits of modeling nuclear schedule optimizations and the resulting minimum power evolutions. Both aspects are crucial for evaluating nuclear flexibility characteristics in simplified low-carbon electric systems that use a significant share of renewable energy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) user scheduling and resource allocation problem for a generic downlink single-cell multiple input and single output (MISO) millimeter wave (mmWave) system. The larger number of packed antennas and the highly directional property of mmWave communications enable directional beamforming to achieve spatial diversity. Toward this end, we consider two different hybrid precoding schemes which are based on orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). Users are assigned into different clusters and the base station (BS) transmits superposed signals that share the same precoding vector. Moreover, both fixed number of users per cluster and dynamic number of users per cluster are investigated. We aim to jointly optimize the user clustering, service scheduling, and power allocation strategy, in maximizing the proportional fairness (PF) among the users and exploring the multiuser diversity and multiplexing gain. Since the formulated joint user clustering, scheduling and power allocation problem is a mixed integer non-convex optimization problem, we propose a two-fold methodology. First, we apply a hybrid precoding and user clustering scheme, where the hybrid precoder is constructed by singular vector division (SVD) or minimum mean square error (MMSE). Then, with the obtained result, we approximate the proportional fairness power allocation problem by a sequence of Geometric Programming (GP) problems which are solved iteratively. The proposed scheme strikes a balance between the spectral efficiency and service fairness. Results show that the proposed MISO-NOMA scheme which is based on MMSE hybrid precoder and the proposed user scheduling and power allocation strategy under proportional fairness metric can outperform various conventional MISO schemes. Furthermore, our proposed dynamic number of users per cluster scheme outperforms the fixed scheme and can be considered as an upper bound in several aspects, including spectral efficiency and fairness. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave self-backhauled small cells are a key component of next-generation wireless networks. Their dense deployment will increase data rates, reduce latency, and enable efficient data transport between the access and backhaul networks, providing greater flexibility not previously possible with optical fiber. Despite their high potential, operating dense self-backhauled networks optimally is an open challenge, particularly for radio resource management (RRM). This paper presents, RadiOrchestra, a holistic RRM framework that models and optimizes beamforming, rate selection as well as user association and admission control for self-backhauled networks. The framework is designed to account for practical challenges such as hardware limitations of base stations (e.g., computational capacity, discrete rates), the need for adaptability of backhaul links, and the presence of interference. Our framework is formulated as a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program, which is challenging to solve. To approach this problem, we propose three algorithms that provide a trade-off between complexity and optimality. Furthermore, we derive upper and lower bounds to characterize the performance limits of the system. We evaluate the developed strategies in various scenarios, showing the feasibility of deploying practical self-backhauling in future networks.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

To enhance the distribution network resilience against typhoon attacks, this paper proposes a resilience-oriented two-stage robust optimization model, in which resilience-constrained unit commitment schemes and planning-operational restoration measures are incorporated into a prevention and emergency response framework. In the prevention response stage, line hardening, flexible devices deployment, and unit commitment are performed before the typhoon attacks. During the typhoons, the emergency response is conducted to mitigate power outages by regulating soft open points, battery storage systems, and generation units. Moreover, considering the time-varying behaviors of typhoon path, the simulation technique for a sequential typhoon attack is developed to construct the spatially and temporally extended N-k uncertainty set for overhead line status. Thereafter, a tight approximation method is introduced to allow the proposed model to be a tractable mixed-integer linear programming problem, which can be easily solved by a nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm. Numerical results show that the comprehensive resilience-oriented strategies can respond rapidly to the worst-case scenario of typhoon attacks with cost-effective performance. © 2022},

	abstract = {With the explosive growth of mobile data, the demand of high-speed railway (HSR) passengers for broadband wireless access services urgently needs the support of ultra-high-speed scenario broadband wireless communication. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) can achieve high data transmission rates, but it is accompanied by high propagation loss and vulnerability to blockage. To address this issue, developments of directional antennas and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enhance the robustness of the mmWave train-ground communication system. In this paper, we propose a UAV and MRs relay assistance (UMRA) algorithm to effectively overcome link blockage, which can maximize the number of transmission flows on the premise of meeting QoS requirements and channel qualities. First, we formulate a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem for UAV trajectory design and transmission scheduling in the full-duplex (FD) mode. Then, in UMRA, the relay decision algorithm and transmission scheduling algorithm based on graph theory are proposed, which make a good tradeoff between computation complexity and system performance. Extensive simulation results show that a suitable UAV position will greatly improve the performance of the UMRA algorithm and make it close to the optimal solution. Compared with the other two existing benchmark schemes, with the high channel quality requirements and large-area blockage, UMRA can greatly improve the number of completed flows and system throughput.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

For this purpose, the identical parallel machine scheduling is integrated with the vehicle routing problem. Considering the highly intractable solution spaces of the integrated problem, hybrid metaheuristics based on the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithms are developed to solve the PRP-TWST problem. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed algorithms considering the total delay time as the objective function. The results are supportive of the VNS-based CS algorithm's effectiveness; the developed metaheuristics can be considered strong benchmarks for further developments in the field.

The approach produces an automated solution for the membrane cleaning scheduling, which also obviates the need for any form of combinatorial optimisation. Two different simulations, for 26 and 52 periods of operation (each period with a duration of one week), are carried out to illustrate the application of the proposed framework and the total cost is 1.17 and 2.48 107 €, respectively.

	abstract = {This research focuses on the home health care optimization problem that involves staff routing and scheduling problems. The considered problem is an extension of multiple travelling salesman problem. It consists of finding the shortest path for a set of caregivers visiting a set of patients at their homes in order to perform various tasks during a given horizon. Thus, a mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed to minimize the overall service time performed by all caregivers while respecting the workload balancing constraint. Nevertheless, when the time horizon become large, practical-sized instances become very difficult to solve in a reasonable computational time. Therefore, a new Learning Genetic Algorithm for mTSP (LGA-mTSP) is proposed to solve the problem. LGA-mTSP is composed of a new genetic algorithm for mTSP, combined with a learning approach, called learning curves. Learning refers to that caregivers’ productivity increases as they gain more experience. Learning curves approach is considered as a way to save time and costs. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed approach and the impact of learning curve strategy to reduce service times. © 2023 CRL Publishing. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In supply chain literature, production coordination and vehicle routing have received a lot of attention. Even though all functions in the supply chain are interrelated, they are normally handled independently. This disconnected approach might lead to less-than-ideal outcomes. Increasing total efficiency by integrating manufacturing and delivery scheduling processes is popular. This study focuses on synchronic production–distribution scheduling difficulties, particularly permutation flow shop scheduling in production and sequence-dependent setup time (SDST) and vehicle routing alternatives in distribution. To create a cost-effective distribution among the placement of geographically separated clients and hence to minimize delivery costs, batch delivery to customers employing a succession of homogenized capacity limitation vehicles is examined here. However, this might result in the failure to complete multiple client orders before their deadlines, raising the cost of lateness. As a result, the goal of this study is to lower the overall cost of tardiness and batch distribution in the supply chain. To accomplish so, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is developed, and the model is solved using a suggested genetic algorithm (GA). Because there is no established benchmark for this issue, a set of genuine problem scenarios is created in order to assess the proposed GA in a viable and difficult environment. Ruiz's benchmark data, which is derived from Taillard's benchmark cases of permutation flow shops, was supplemented with SDSTs in the production of test examples. In comparison to an exact method, the results show that the proposed GA can rapidly seek solutions to optimality for most small-sized instances. Furthermore, for medium and large-scale cases, the proposed GA continues to work well and produces solutions in a fair amount of time in comparison to GA without the local search. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This study aims at reducing energy consumption in supply chain networks by providing optimal integrated production and transportation scheduling. The considered supply chain consists of one main manufacturing center, multiple production units (i.e., suppliers), and multiple heterogeneous vehicles as the transportation fleet. To schedule this complex supply chain network in an energy-efficient way, several decisions should be made concerning the assignment of orders to suppliers and determining their production sequence, splitting orders, assigning orders to vehicles, and assigning delivery priority to orders. To cope with the problem, a mixed-integer linear programming model is presented. Due to the complexity of the problem, a novel development of the genetic algorithm named the Multiple Reference Group Genetic Algorithm (MRGGA) is also proposed. Four objectives are considered to be optimized to meet both suitability and energy-efficiency aspects in the supply chain network. These optimization objectives are to minimize the total orders' delivery times to the manufacturing center, fuel consumption by the vehicles, energy consumption at supplies, and maximize orders' quality. To analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm, a real case and a set of generated instances are solved. The results obtained by the proposed algorithm are compared with an existing genetic algorithm in the literature. Moreover, the results are also compared with the optimal solutions obtained from the mathematical model for small-size problems. The results of the comparisons show the efficiency of the proposed MRGGA in finding energy-efficient solutions for the considered supply chain network. © 2022 The Authors.

The new requirements enforce to (i) provide teachers with the same idle times, (ii) avoid consecutive days with heavy workload, (iii) limit multiple daily lessons for each class, (iv) introduce shorter time units to differentiate entry and exit times. We present an integer programming model for this problem, which is denoted by Italian High School Timetabling Problem (IHSTP). However, requirements (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) cannot be expressed according to the current XHSTT standard. Since the IHSTP model is very hard to solve by an off-the-shelf solver, we present a two-step optimization method: the first step optimally assigns teachers to lesson times and the second step assigns classes to teachers. An extensive experimentation is performed on the model by realistic and real instances from Italian schools, as well as benchmark instances from the literature. Finally, the experiments show that the method is effective in solving both this new problem and the simplified problem without the new requirements. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

First, a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear programming model is used to obtain the VPP's generation and reserve schedule and the opportunity cost of the energy stored in the battery. The model has an hourly resolution and a look-ahead period beyond the markets’ scheduling horizon and considers the hourly battery degradation costs as a function of both the depth of discharge and the discharge rate. Different strategies are evaluated to forecast the real-time use of the committed secondary regulation reserves. Second, a deterministic MILP model is used to determine the redispatch of the VPP using as input the generation and reserve schedule and the VPP's storage opportunity cost provided by the former model and is executed on an hourly rolling basis. The results obtained show that the proposed models are effective for the short-term scheduling and redispatch of the VPP used with a low computational time, making them tractable and practical for their daily use. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

One possible formulation is the generalized assignment problem, where the goal is to find a maximum payoff while satisfying capability constraints. We propose a purely distributed branch-and-price algorithm to solve this problem in a cooperative fashion. Inspired by classical (centralized) branch-and-price schemes, in the proposed algorithm, each agent locally solves small linear programs, generates columns by solving simple knapsack problems, and communicates to its neighbors a fixed number of basic columns. We prove finite-time convergence of the algorithm to an optimal solution of the problem. Then, we apply the proposed scheme to a generalized assignment scenario, in which a team of robots has to serve a set of tasks. We implement the proposed algorithm in a Robot Operating System testbed and provide experiments for a team of heterogeneous robots solving the assignment problem.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Optimizing the railway timetable to increase synchronous accelerating and braking processes can lead to an improvement in the usage of regenerative energy. However, such a synchronized timetable might result in little or unsuitable transfer connections for the passengers. This paper focuses on the optimization of railway periodic timetables, to increase usage of regenerative energy while ensuring passenger satisfaction. We work by extending the traditional Periodic Event Scheduling Problem (PESP) formulation, to address the problem of synchronization of acceleration and braking phases, (and re-used energy) and including passenger-related events (and their satisfaction). Three objectives are identified, in a resulting Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model: maximizing the overlapping times of accelerating and braking trains to achieve increased usage of regenerative energy, minimizing the total passengers’ generalized travel times (global passenger dissatisfaction), and minimizing the maximum increase in individual's generalized travel time (local passenger dissatisfaction). A multi-step approach solves the trade-offs among three conflicting objectives. Results on a realistic case study show that the proposed approach can find optimized timetables, which compared to the currently-in-use timetable, can increase the usage of regenerative energy by over 1.5 times, save the average generalized travel time per passenger by 2 min, with only a minor increase on specific individual generalized travel time (up to 4 min). A detailed results analysis imply that to achieve a higher usage of regenerative energy, it is required to have a higher tolerance for the maximum increase in individual generalized travel time, while this is not necessary for the overall passenger generalized travel time, which can even be reduced when the maximum increase in individual generalized travel time becomes larger. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The dynamic nature of wastewater treatment and the significant number of energy conversion and recovery technologies applicable to the process, require a modelling framework that can be used for optimization and planning. This paper introduces a dynamic energy dispatch optimization framework with a combination of energy recovery and reserve options for water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs). Energy potentials, including biogas, electricity, and heat, were assessed for 15 large-scale WRRFs, which serve approximately 80% of the Irish population. The framework was applied by simulation of the national electrical system on an hourly basis for 2030 using mixed-integer programming (MIP) for eight scenarios. The simulation enabled automatic operational command scheduling for the production, conversion, storage, and supply over a year at an hourly time resolution. Meanwhile, the significance of several energy resources was assessed, and the impact of dynamic energy dispatch examined. A total potential cost saving of €46.35 M was possible through implementation of dynamic economic dispatch optimization (54% from biogas cogeneration, 40 %from thermal energy recovery, and 6% from micro-hydropower electricity). In addition, reductions in carbon emissions (2%), fossil fuel consumption (3%), startup costs (18%) and outsourcing dependency (5%) were possible. Up to 0.5% of whole system power demand and 90% of considered heat demand at peak periods could be provided by the proposed framework through dynamic economic dispatch. Therefore, this study suggests that WRRFs can participate into energy system through the dynamic economic dispatch of recovered energy, and provide potential energy flexibility, as well as adding value to overall sustainability of energy system. © 2022 The Author(s)},

We develop two general solution procedures: a cutting-plane method that leverages the submodularity in the models and a customized dichotomic search procedure with a decision version of a bin packing variant under uncertainty solved in each iteration. A branch-and-price algorithm is designed to solve the bin packing problems. The efficiency of our methods is shown through extensive computational tests.

	abstract = {In this study, we address workload balancing in Emergency Department Physician Rostering Problems. We propose a two-phase approach to deal with two common workload balancing issues: (1) the even distribution of worked weekends and weekend night shifts across physicians in the long term, and (2) the even distribution of morning and afternoon shifts in the medium term. To implement such an approach, we have developed two Integer Linear Programming (ILP) models, one for each phase. In the first phase, we determine the weekends that each physician will be on duty over the long term planning horizon (6-months) while evenly distributing the workload (worked weekends and weekend night shifts) across physicians. In the second phase, month by month, we iteratively determine the workday shifts of each physician while pursuing the even distribution of workload (morning and afternoon shifts) across physicians. The second phase relies on the solution of the first phase, i.e., the weekend shifts assigned to each physician in the first phase are considered preassigned shifts in the second phase. In both phases, we consider the constraints deriving from collective as well as individual contractual agreements (e.g. constraints limiting the maximum number of night shifts each physician can work every month, their maximum weekly and monthly workload, etc.) as well as individual physician’s preferences and desiderata. The problems addressed in the two phases differ in terms of the planning horizon, objective function, and constraints, yet they are both modeled as multicommodity ow problems and share the same network structure. Also, we define some families of simple yet effective, valid inequalities that are crucial to address the computational complexity of the first-phase problem. The proposed optimization models have been tested on real data from a leading European Hospital and on benchmark instances from the literature. The models’ effectiveness has been assessed through six key performance indicators purposely defined. Results demonstrate that the presented models allow considering the complex nature of physicians rostering problems and obtaining well-balanced and thus equitable work schedules. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Demand response (DR) of large industrial electricity consumers is a promising option to balance the fluctuating supply by renewable energies in the electricity grid. Renewable energy technologies themselves depend on copper as a key material. At the same time, the production of copper is a power-intensive process but its DR potential has not yet been quantified in detail via process scheduling. Here, we analyze the DR potential of copper production by optimally scheduling the batch and continuous tasks of a representative copper process. To determine the optimal schedule, we formulate a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) based on the resource-task network (RTN) formulation approach. We first optimize the production volume to define a reference case and then minimize the electricity costs under time-varying electricity prices while retaining the production target. A sensitivity analysis evaluates the impact of task capacities on the production volume and DR potential. The results indicate a significant DR potential, as optimal scheduling can reduce the annual electricity costs by up to 14.2% while still producing the maximum copper output as the reference process schedule. The power-intensive electrolytic refining shows the largest potential for reducing costs. Offgas handling, air separation, and air compression further show significant cost reduction potentials. These tasks must process large material streams that are directly connected to operating the smelting and refining tasks. Our model shows the potential of considering these interlinked tasks in one scheduling model that focuses on DR. The results suggest that DR scheduling in copper production has a significant economic potential without compromising production goals. Further, the DR scheduling shifts large amounts of electricity demand by responding to fluctuating electricity prices, which enables flexibility of the demand side and can thus support the integration of renewable energy into the electric grid. © 2022 The Author(s)},

According to the limited historical sample data, under the condition of satisfying a certain confidence level, based on the imprecise Dirichlet model (IDM), an ambiguity set is constructed to describe the uncertainty of transmission line fault probability. Through the identification of the worst probability distribution in the ambiguity set, the adaptive robust optimal scheduling problem is transformed into a two-stage robust optimization decision model under the condition of deterministic probability distribution. The CSP flexibility column and constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm is used to process the model and the main problem and subproblem are solved by using the Big-M method, linearization technique, and duality principle. Then, a mixed integer linear programming problem (MILP) model is obtained, which effectively reduces the difficulty of solving the model. Finally, case studies on the IEEE 14 bus system and the IEEE 118 bus system demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, such as enhancing the ability of power systems to cope with occasional line fault disturbances and reducing the conservatism of the robust optimization method. © 2022 by the authors.},

Based on the concept of budgeted uncertainty, the objective is to obtain a robust scheduling that minimizes the makespan of the restricted worst-case scenario, where only a subset of job processing times will oscillate to their worst-case values. To our knowledge, this is the first work to obtain optimal solutions to this problem, by extending two classical MILP formulations for the deterministic case and combining them with a Column-and-Constraint Generation framework. For this purpose, a dynamic programming algorithm was also developed, allowing the identification of worst-case scenarios in polynomial time.

	abstract = {Nowadays there exists a wide variety of automatic machines that perform analytical tests on liquid samples, such as water, blood, urines, saliva, etc. A test can be modelled as a set of activities with given precedences and through sharing a set of limited resources. A scheduling process is therefore required to find a feasible or optimal execution of a set of tests. An important particularity of the machines performing tests are their storage areas of limited capacity. For instance, one activity may require a sample to be moved to an observation area, while another activity may later remove this sample from that observation area. In this paper, we introduce a real problem encountered in the analytical instrument industry known as the Sample Analysis Machine Scheduling Problem (SAMSP). We show that the SAMSP is a particular case of the Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem with Cumulative Resources (RCPSP-Cu), and present a successful application of optimization techniques for it. We are interested in exact approaches, since the models presented will be used to prove the maximum throughput of the selected machine layouts.

	abstract = {With the growing adoption of renewable energy resources in the power grid, co-optimizing the operation of water and power distribution networks (WDNs and PDNs) increases the flexibility of both systems. The optimal water power flow problem (OWPF) is formulated to manage resource utilization across the WDNs and multi-phase PDNs. The nonlinear WDN hydraulic constraints and PDN ac power flow equations render the OWPF problem nonconvex. This paper formulates a convex optimal water power flow (C-OWPF) problem adopting successive approximations in WDNs and branch-flow relaxations in PDNs. The C-OWPF problem is a mixed-integer semidefinite program, which is computationally challenging even for small instances. Additionally, privacy considerations of WDN and PDN operators motivate the need for solving the C-OWPF in a distributed fashion. This paper develops a C-OWPF solver based on Benders decomposition that overcomes computational complexity challenges and preserve the privacy of the respective operators. The merits of the Benders decomposition-based solver are demonstrated on the IEEE 4-bus PDN coupled with a 3-node WDN and the IEEE 123-bus PDN coupled with the 36-node WDN. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Optimization problems with uncertain black-box constraints, modeled by warped Gaussian processes, have recently been considered in the Bayesian optimization setting. This work considers optimization problems with aggregated black-box constraints. Each aggregated black-box constraint sums several draws from the same black-box function with different decision variables as arguments in each individual black-box term. Such constraints are important in applications where, e.g., safety-critical measures are aggregated over multiple time periods. Our approach, which uses robust optimization, reformulates these uncertain constraints into deterministic constraints guaranteed to be satisfied with a specified probability, i.e., deterministic approximations to a chance constraint. While robust optimization typically considers parametric uncertainty, our approach considers uncertain functions modeled by warped Gaussian processes. We analyze convexity conditions and propose a custom global optimization strategy for non-convex cases. A case study derived from production planning and an industrially relevant example from oil well drilling show that the approach effectively mitigates uncertainty in the learned curves. For the drill scheduling example, we develop a custom strategy for globally optimizing integer decisions. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This article discusses optimum designs of photovoltaic (PV) systems with battery energy storage system (BESS) by using real-world data. Specifically, we identify the optimum size of PV panels, the optimum capacity of BESS, and the optimum scheduling of BESS charging/discharging, such that the long-term overall cost, including both utility bills and the PV system, is minimized. The optimization is performed by considering a plethora of parameters, such as energy usage, energy cost, weather, geographic location, inflation, and the cost, efficiency, and aging effects of solar panels and BESS. To capture the impacts of long-term factors such as aging effects, inflation, and discounted economic returns, the problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem over the time horizon covering the entire life cycles of solar panels and BESS of the order of ten years or longer, whereas almost all existing works on PV system designs consider much shorter time horizons of the order of days or weeks. The MINLP is transformed into mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and solved by branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm. The complexity of MILP is high due to the long time horizon. A new low-complexity algorithm is then proposed by using dynamic programming, where it is shown that the MINLP problem can be transformed into one that satisfies Bellman's principal of optimality. Applying the newly developed algorithms on real-world data from a commercial user in San Francisco reveals that the system achieves the break-even point at the 66th month and achieves a 29.3% reduction in total system cost.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

Showing such correlations is one of the aims of this paper. For some of the derived problems having exponential time complexity, the question arises of their solvability for larger instances. Instead of the traditional approach based on the use of approximate or stochastic heuristic methods, we focus here on the direct use of mixed integer programming models in the GAMS environment, which is now capable of solving instances much larger than in the past and does not require complex parameter settings or statistical evaluation of the results as in the case of stochastic heuristics because the computational core of software tools, nested in GAMS, is deterministic in nature. The source codes presented may be an aid because this tool is not yet as well known as the MATLAB Optimisation Toolbox.

In particular, a branch-and-check variant of LBBD can be faster by several orders of magnitude, allowing significantly larger instances to be solved. This is due primarily to computational overhead incurred by the integer L-shaped method while generating classic Benders cuts from a continuous relaxation of an integer programming subproblem. To our knowledge, this is the first application of LBBD to two-stage stochastic optimization with a scheduling second-stage problem and the first comparison of LBBD with the integer L-shaped method.

	abstract = {Context: In software engineering practice, fixing bugs in a timely manner lowers various potential costs in software maintenance. However, manual bug fixing scheduling can be time-consuming, cumbersome, and error-prone. Objective: In this paper, we propose the Schedule and Dependency-aware Bug Triage (S-DABT), a bug triaging method that utilizes integer programming and machine learning techniques to assign bugs to suitable developers. Methods: Unlike prior works that largely focus on a single component of the bug reports, our approach takes into account the textual data, bug fixing costs, and bug dependencies. We further incorporate the schedule of developers in our formulation to have a more comprehensive model for this multifaceted problem. As a result, this complete formulation considers developers’ schedules and the blocking effects of the bugs while covering the most significant aspects of the previously proposed methods. Results: Our numerical study on four open-source software systems, namely, ECLIPSEJDT, LIBREOFFICE, GCC, and MOZILLA, shows that taking into account the schedules of the developers decreases the average bug fixing times. We find that S-DABT leads to a high level of developer utilization by a fair distribution of the tasks among the developers and efficient use of the free spots in their schedules. Via the simulation of the issue tracking system, we also show how incorporating the schedule in the model formulation reduces the bug fixing time, improves the assignment accuracy, and utilizes the capability of each developer without much comprising in the model run times. Conclusion: We find that S-DABT decreases the complexity of the bug dependency graph by prioritizing blocking bugs and effectively reduces the infeasible assignment ratio due to bug dependencies. Consequently, we recommend considering developers’ schedules while automating bug triage. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Hurricane, as one of the most frequent natural events, causes damage to the infrastructure of the upstream networks of multiple energy carrier microgrids (MECMs). Thus, the supply continuity of critical loads is threatened due to sudden islanding of MECMs from the upstream networks. Therefore, providing a framework to enhance the resilience of MECMs against this threat is necessary. In response to this issue, this paper presents a proactive optimal operation scheduling approach that is constrained to the feasible islanding of MECM from the upstream networks as well as the continuous suppling of the critical loads until the return of the upstream networks. Proposed resiliency constraint proactive scheduling is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) that considers the interdependence between all three electric, gas and heat networks. The demand responsibility of all three electric, thermal and gas loads is used to consider the satisfaction of the consumer beside economic and resilient operation. Furthermore, both normal operation and contingency-based uncertainties are taken into account and captured using a robust optimization method. Then in order to evaluate the resilience of the MECM, feasible islanding and preparedness indices are proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed approach is illustrated using an MECM test. © 2022 The Authors.

The goal program converts the tedious monthly tasks of the head of the radiology department of a leading hospital to a simple goal optimization problem that abides to the regulations of the Ministry of Health and avoids conflicting issues that may arise among coworkers. The optimization problem which is designed for the tactical level can also be used at the strategic level (i.e., account for a long time horizon) to plan for longer term constraints such vacations, medical and study leaves, recruitment, retirement, etc. Despite its large size, the problem is herein solved using an off-the-shelf solver (CPLEX). Empirical tests on the design of timetables for the case study prove the efficiency of the obtained schedule and highlights the time gain and utility of the developed model. They reflect the practical aspects of timetabling and radiologists'availability. Specifically, not only does the model and its solution reduce the effort of the Department head in this design stage, but it also promotes social peace among the technicians and a sense of fairness/unbiasedness. In addition, the designed model can be used at the operational level as a rescheduling tool by those technicians wishing to trade their shifts, and as a sensitivity analysis tool by managers wishing to study the effect of some phenomena such as absenteeism, increasing or decreasing the workforce, and extending work hours on the welfare of patients.  © The authors.

	abstract = {The increasing share of volatile renewable electricity production motivates demand response. Substantial potential for demand response is offered by flexible processes and their local multi-energy supply systems. Simultaneous optimization of their schedules can exploit the demand response potential, but leads to numerically challenging problems for nonlinear dynamic processes. In this paper, we propose to capture process dynamics using dynamic ramping constraints. In contrast to traditional static ramping constraints, dynamic ramping constraints are a function of the process state and can capture high-order dynamics. We derive dynamic ramping constraints rigorously for the case of single-input single-output processes that are exactly input-state linearizable. The resulting scheduling problem can be efficiently solved as a mixed-integer linear program. In a case study, we study two flexible reactors and a multi-energy system. The proper representation of process dynamics by dynamic ramping allows for faster transitions compared to static ramping constraints and thus higher economic benefits of demand response. The proposed dynamic ramping approach is sufficiently fast for application in online optimization. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper investigates a new energy-efficient scheduling problem of automated container terminals, in which quay cranes (QCs) and lift automated guided vehicles (AGVs) cooperate to handle inbound and outbound containers. In our scheduling problem, operation times and task sequences are both to be determined. The underlying optimization problem is mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). To deal with its computational intractability, a customized and efficient genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to solve the studied MINLP problem, and lexicographic and weighted-sum strategies are further considered. An $\epsilon $ -constraint algorithm is also developed to analyze the Pareto frontiers. Comprehensive experiments are tested on a container handling benchmark system, and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed lexicographic GA, compared to results obtained with two commonly-used metaheuristics, a commercial MINLP solver, and two state-of-the-art methods.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Fog computing-based radio access network (Fog-RAN) leveraging the software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) is the most promising solution to offer real-time support for the massive number of connected devices in the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks. However, designing an optimal dynamic radio resource allocation to handle the fluctuating traffic loads is critical. In this article, a novel architectural design of an SDN-based virtual Fog-RAN is proposed, in which we jointly study radio resource allocation and transmit beamforming to improve resource utilization and IIoT users' satisfaction, by minimizing the network power consumption (NPC) and maximizing the achievable sum-rate (ASR), simultaneously. To this end, we first formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear problem to optimize the physical resource block allocation, the assignment of user equipments, and radio unit, and the downlink transmit beamforming, by considering imperfect channel state information. To solve the ntractable MINLP, we exploit the successive convex approximation approach. Then, we formulate a multiple knapsack problem (MKP) to optimize the assignment between RUs and virtual baseband units, by exploiting the set of active RUs minimized in the previous problem. We solve the formulated MKP by decomposing the dual problems and solving them through the dual descent method. Through performance analysis, we show the proposed approach provides a high users' satisfaction rate, maximizes the ASR and minimizes the NPC, and provides better savings, in terms of the number of radio and baseband resources utilized, than its counterparts.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

This paper aims to seek a well-coordinated last train timetable that can transport as many passengers as possible to their destinations (referred to as reachable passengers) and also transport those passengers who cannot reach their destinations (referred to as unreachable passengers) to the stations as close as possible to their destinations. A bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed to maximize the number of reachable passengers and minimize the total remaining travel distance of all passengers. The augmented ε-constraint method is applied to generate all Pareto optimal solutions of the bi-objective MILP model. Numerical experiments were implemented in the Chengdu URT network. Results indicate that compared to the current-in-use timetable, the optimized timetable by our methods significantly increased the number of reachable passengers and meanwhile reduced the average remaining travel distance of unreachable passengers. In addition, we discussed two possible strategies to improve passengers’ destination reachability, which are encouraging passengers to arrive early at their origin stations, and optimizing the timetable of last trains and non-last trains at the same time. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Demand response programs are essential to enable accommodating larger shares of variable power generation based on renewable sources, the deployment of which is imperative for decarbonizing the economy and mitigating global warming. Consumers/prosumers are increasingly exposed to and may benefit from time-differentiated energy prices aimed to induce changes in regular consumption patterns. These changes are also beneficial for retailers and grid operators in face of the variability of wholesale market prices, renewable energy availability and grid conditions. The optimization models to be implemented in autonomous home energy management systems require a rigorous modeling of appliance operation to generate effective load scheduling solutions, respecting their physical operation principles and use patterns in everyday life. A balance should be sought between the detail level of optimization models and the computational requirements to generate usable solutions having in mind their implementation in low-cost processors. This paper presents a comprehensive and modular set of mixed-integer linear programming models aimed at enabling their seamless incorporation in home energy management systems, allowing for the integrated optimization of all energy resources (exchanges with the grid, load management, electric vehicle and stationary battery, local microgeneration). Detailed energy consumption optimization models for shiftable, interruptible and thermostatic loads are presented, also including the power cost component and ways of dealing with user's discomfort. The modular models are presented in a building block manner enhancing the flexibility of their utilization in overall models with different objective functions encompassing the economic and comfort dimensions. Computational results are presented for a case study using actual data, which considers a time-of-use tariff with six periods. In addition to comparing with a plain tariff scheme, different consumer profiles are simulated to assess the impact of comfort requirements on cost. These results show that whenever consumers have the flexibility to change their consumption patterns, they are able to lower the net electricity bill by having an energy management system endowed with the models herein proposed to make optimized decisions on their behalf. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Batteries, hydrogen or pumped hydro storage systems can be combined to form hybrid storage facilities to not only manage the intermittent behavior of renewable sources, but also to store surplus renewable energy in a practice known as ‘green’ storage. On the other hand, demand-response programs are devoted to encouraging a more active participation of consumers by pursuing a more efficient operation of the system. In this context, proper scheduling tools able to coordinate different storage systems and demand-response programs are essential. This paper presents a stochastic mixed-integer-lineal-logical framework for optimal scheduling of isolated microgrids. In contrast to other works, the present model includes a logical-based formulation to explicitly coordinate batteries and pumped hydro storage units. A case study on a benchmark isolated microgrid serves to validate the developed optimization model and analyze the effect of applying demand-response premises in microgrid operation. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the developed method, and it is found that operation cost and fuel consumption can be reduced by ~38% and ~82% by applying demand-response initiatives. © 2022 by the authors.},

Assigning a container to its affinity machine can reduce communication and transport costs while assigning it to the anti-affinity machine may affect the proper operation of the container. Existing container scheduling methods cannot accommodate these two types of requirements. In order to reduce the operation and maintenance cost of data centers, this article focuses on the container instance allocation problem in heterogeneous server cluster, and proposes a global cost-aware scheduling algorithm (GCCS) to solve it. The purpose is to minimize the total power consumption of the cluster from a global perspective, while trying to meet the affinity/anti-affinity requirements of applications. We study the number of containers per server selected by the application, model it as an integer linear program (ILP), and then propose a heuristic search algorithm to repair the relaxation solution of the ILP into a suboptimal feasible solution. In particular, we use Bayesian optimizer to perform a number of automated development and exploration processes for the selection of the cost coefficient. The experiments are carried out with the best cost coefficient recommended by Bayesian optimizer. Finally, the results demonstrate that GCCS can significantly reduce the total power consumption of the cluster, while maintaining a high affinity satisfaction ratio. © 1990-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the problem of minimizing the age of information (AoI) in cellular vehicle-to-everything communications. To provide minimal AoI and high reliability for vehicles' safety information, non-orthogonal multiple access is exploited. We reformulate a resource allocation problem that involves half-duplex transceiver selection, broadcast coverage optimization, power allocation, and resource block (RB) scheduling. First, to obtain the optimal solution, we formulate the problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem and then study its NP-hardness. The negative result of NP-hardness motivates us to design efficient sub-optimal solutions. Consequently, we model the problem as a single-agent Markov decision process (MDP). The MDP model helps in solving the problem efficiently using fingerprint deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques such as deep-Q-network (DQN) methods. Nevertheless, applying DQN is not straightforward due to the curse of dimensionality implied by the large and mixed action space that contains discrete RB scheduling decisions and continuous power and coverage optimization decisions. Therefore, to solve this mixed discrete/continuous problem efficiently simply and elegantly, we propose a decomposition technique that consists of first solving the discrete subproblem using a matching algorithm based on state-of-the-art stable roommate matching and then solving the continuous subproblem using DRL algorithm that is based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). We validate our proposed method through Monte Carlo simulations where we show that the decomposed matching and DRL algorithm successfully minimizes the AoI and achieves almost 66% performance gain compared to the best benchmarks for various vehicles' speeds, transmission power, or packet sizes. Further, we prove the existence of an optimal value of broadcast coverage at which the learning algorithm provides the optimal AoI.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Demand Response (DR) is proven very efficacious in load mitigation, especially in peak time period. DR benefits both consumers and system operators so that they can reduce their payment and system operating cost, respectively. The proposed cost minimization is currently used as a clearing mechanism with locational marginal pricing scheme to determine consumers' payment. These clearing and pricing mechanisms are inconsistent as the system cost is minimized, but the final payments are calculated based on marginal prices. Payment Cost Minimization (PCM) auction as a price-based clearing mechanism is envisaged to be an effective alternative to solve the issue. This paper demonstrates how to include DR in PCM mechanism to further reduce the consumers' payment. It facilitates utilizing price responsive consumers for Load Shifting DR (LSDR) in PCM auction. The optimization problem is modeled as a mixed-integer nonlinear bi-level programming. Duality theorem, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, and integer algebra are used to convert such a problem into a single-level mixed-integer linear programing problem. This problem is then solved by CPLEX solver in GAMS. The impacts of LSDR are studied using the proposed formulation to solve the clearing problem in the case studies, deriving promising numerical results.  © 2022 Sharif University of Technology.

	abstract = {In light of the Industry 5.0 trend towards human-centric and resilient industries, human-robot collaboration (HRC) assembly lines can be used to enhance productivity and workers’ well-being, provided that the optimal allocation of tasks and available resources can be determined. This study investigates the assembly line balancing problem (ALBP), considering HRC. This problem, abbreviated ALBP-HRC, arises in advanced manufacturing systems, where humans and collaborative robots share the same workplace and can simultaneously perform tasks in parallel or in collaboration. Driven by the need to solve the more complex assembly line-balancing problems found in the automotive industry, this study aims to address the ALBP-HRC with the cycle time and the number of operators (humans and robots) as the primary and secondary objective, respectively. In addition to the traditional ALBP constraints, the human and robot characteristics, in terms of task times, allowing multiple humans and robots at stations, and their joint/collaborative tasks are formulated into a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. A neighborhood-search simulated annealing (SA) is proposed with customized solution representation and neighborhood search operators designed to fit into the problem characteristics. Furthermore, the proposed SA features an adaptive neighborhood selection mechanism that enables the SA to utilize its exploration history to dynamically choose appropriate neighborhood operators as the search evolves. The proposed MILP and SA are implemented on real cases taken from the automotive industry where stations are designed for HRC. The computational results over different problems show that the adaptive SA produces promising solutions compared to the MILP and other swarm intelligence algorithms, namely genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and artificial bee colony. The comparisons of human/robot versus HRC settings in the case study indicate significant improvement in the productivity of the assembly line when multiple humans and robots with collaborative tasks are permissible at stations. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {We introduce a new class of distributionally robust optimization problems under decision-dependent ambiguity sets. In particular, as our ambiguity sets, we consider balls centered on a decision-dependent probability distribution. The balls are based on a class of earth mover's distances that includes both the total variation distance and the Wasserstein metrics. We discuss the main computational challenges in solving the problems of interest and provide an overview of various settings leading to tractable formulations. Some of the arising side results, such as the mathematical programming expressions for robustified risk measures in a discrete space, are also of independent interest. Finally, we rely on state-of-the-art modeling techniques from machine scheduling and humanitarian logistics to arrive at potentially practical applications, and present a numerical study for a novel risk-averse scheduling problem with controllable processing times.

We present a unified modeling framework along with a discussion on possible ways to specify the key model components, and discuss the main computational challenges in solving the complex problems of interest. Special care has been devoted to identifying the settings and problem classes where these challenges can be mitigated.

	abstract = {Given its ability to control and manipulate wireless environments, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), also known as intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), has emerged as a key enabler technology for the six-generation (6G) cellular networks. In the meantime, vehicular environment radio propagation is negatively influenced by a large set of objects that cause transmission distortion such as high buildings. Therefore, this work is devoted to explore the area of RIS technology integration with vehicular communications while considering the dynamic nature of such communication environment. Specifically, we provide a system model where RoadSide Unit (RSU) leverages RIS to provide indirect wireless transmissions to disconnected areas, known as dark zones. Dark zones are spots within RSU coverage where the communication links are blocked due to the existence of blockages. In details, a discrete RIS is utilized to provide communication links between the RSU and the vehicles passing through out-of-service zones. Therefore, the joint problem of RSU resource scheduling and RIS passive beamforming or phase-shift matrix is formulated as an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the minimum average bit rate. The formulated problem is mixed integer non-convex program which is difficult to be solved and does not account for the uncertain dynamic environment in vehicular networks. Thereby, we resort to alternative methods based on Deep Reinforcement Learning to determine RSU wireless scheduling and Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) to solve for the phase-shift matrix, i.e., passive beamforming, of the RIS. The Markov Decision Process (MDP) is defined and the complexity of the solution approach is discussed. Our numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over baseline techniques.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Vessels face uncertain factors during a voyage, such as bad weather and harsh sea conditions along a route in container liner shipping. As such, the real vessel speed during each leg of a voyage often deviates from the planned one, which may lead to fluctuations in vessel schedule and bunker consumption. This paper investigates the problem of vessel scheduling and bunker management with speed deviations (VSBMSD) for liner shipping in the presence of collaborative agreements. By establishing the worst-case scenario of the maximum bunker consumption function with vessel sailing speed as an independent variable, we develop a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model to minimize the total liner shipping route service cost. A piecewise linear secant approximation method is designed, and then a CPLEX solver is used to solve the problem. The results of the computational experiments conducted for the AEMX route indicate that VSBMSD in the presence of collaborative agreements can enable shipping companies to design vessel schedules reasonably and reduce the total cost of liner shipping route service by at least 2.95% compared to the results from similar studies.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Planning in public transportation is traditionally done in a sequential process: After the network design process, the lines and their frequencies are planned. When these are fixed, a timetable is determined and based on the timetable, the vehicle and crew schedules are optimized. After each step, passenger routes are adapted to model the behavior of the passengers as realistically as possible. It has been mentioned in many publications that such a sequential process is sub-optimal, and integrated approaches, mainly heuristics, are under consideration. Sequential planning is not only common in public transportation planning but also in many other applied problems, among others in supply chain management, or in organizing hospitals efficiently. The contribution of this paper hence is two-fold: on the one hand, we develop an integrated integer programming formulation for the three planning stages line planning, (periodic) timetabling, and vehicle scheduling which also includes the integrated optimization of the passenger routes. This gives us an exact formulation rewriting the sequential approach as an integrated problem. We discuss properties of the integrated formulation and apply it experimentally to data sets from the LinTim library. On small examples, we get an exact optimal objective function value for the integrated formulation which can be compared with the outcome of the sequential process. On the other hand, we propose a mathematical formulation for general sequential processes which can be used to build integrated formulations. For comparing sequential processes with their integrated counterparts we analyze the price of sequentiality, i.e., the ratio between the solution obtained by the sequential process and an integrated solution. We also experiment with different possibilities for partial integration of a subset of the sequential problems and again illustrate our results using the case of public transportation. The obtained results may be useful for other sequential processes. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Railway station plays an important role in improving the operation efficiency of rail-sea intermodal container terminal. The cooperative scheduling of multiple gantry cranes (GCs) can reduce the production and operation cost of railway station. Most studies look into discarding the conflict schemes of GCs, which may obtain excellent scheduling results. These existing conflict-free strategies can not contribute to enhancing the cooperative scheduling performance of multiple GCs. This study integrates container trucks into multiple GCs scheduling environment to eliminate those conflicts, and proposes a mixed-integer programming model considering cooperation between multiple GCs and trucks. The model aims to simultaneously minimize the makespan of the container handling system in station, the total empty travel time of GCs and the total energy consumption of both cranes and trucks. To solve the proposed model, a conflict-free operation strategy for multiple GCs based on hybrid indirect loading and unloading (CFHI) is proposed. CFHI strategy is implemented according to the cooperation between GCs and trucks. An effective multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm (EMOABC) based on CFHI and fuzzy correlation entropy (FCE) is developed. Within the developed algorithm, an encoding/decoding method based on CFHI is designed to represent and decode the population solutions. The FCE is adopted to evaluate and select the better solutions for next iteration evolution. The effectiveness of the proposed CFHI strategy is verified by comparing it with two popular equipment allocation strategies. Extensive experimental results show that proposed EMOABC is effective to the proposed model. Our findings here have significant implications for the cooperative operation of multiple GCs considering energy consumption in container terminal.  © 2013 IEEE.},

The Branch-and-Cut algorithm is based on an implicit Benders decomposition scheme, where we generate cutting planes as outer approximation cuts from the projection of the feasible region on suitable subspaces. The size of the master problem in our scheme is much smaller than the deterministic reformulation of the chance-constrained problem. We apply the Branch-and-Cut algorithm to the mid-term hydro scheduling problem, for which we propose a chance-constrained formulation. A computational study using data from ten hydroplants in Greece shows that the proposed methodology solves instances faster than applying a general-purpose solver for convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems to the deterministic reformulation, and scales much better with the number of scenarios. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature and Mathematical Optimization Society.},

	abstract = {This study addresses the traffic light scheduling problem for pedestrian–vehicle mixed-flow networks. A macroscopic model, which strikes an appropriate balance between pedestrians’ needs and vehicle drivers’ needs, is employed to describe the traffic light scheduling problem in a scheduling framework. The objective of this problem is to minimize the total network-wise delay time of vehicles and pedestrians within a given finite-time window, which is crucial to avoid traffic congestion in urban road networks. To achieve this objective, the present study first uses a well-known optimization solver called GUROBI to obtain the optimal solution by converting the problem into mixed-integer linear programming. The obtained results indicate the computational inefficiency of the solver for large network sizes. To overcome this computational inefficiency, three novel metaheuristic methods based on the sine–cosine algorithm are proposed. These methods are denoted by discrete sine–cosine algorithm, discrete sine–cosine algorithm with local search operator, and discrete sine–cosine algorithm with local search operator and memory utilization inspired by harmony search. Each of these methods is developed hierarchically by taking the advantages of previously developed method(s) in terms of a better search process to provide more accurate solutions and a better convergence rate. To validate all these proposed metaheuristics, extensive computational experiments are carried out using the real traffic infrastructure of Singapore. Moreover, various performance measures such as statistical optimization results, relative percentage deviation, computational time, statistical analysis, and convergence behavior analysis have been employed to evaluate the performance of algorithms. The comparison of the proposed SCA variants is done with GUROBI solver and other metaheuristics namely, harmony search, firefly algorithm, bat algorithm, artificial bee colony, genetic algorithm, salp swarm algorithm, and harris hawks optimization. Overall comparison analysis concludes that the proposed methods are very efficient to solve the traffic light scheduling problem for pedestrian–vehicle mixed-flow networks with different network sizes and prediction time horizons. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

To overcome the performance limitations of near-term QC, utilizing the current quantum computers to complement classical techniques for solving real-world problems is of utmost importance. In this article, we develop QC-based solution strategies that exploit quantum annealing and classical optimization techniques for solving large-scale scheduling problems in manufacturing systems. The applications of the proposed algorithms are illustrated through two case studies in production scheduling. First, we present a hybrid QC-based solution approach for the job-shop scheduling problem. Second, we propose a hybrid QC-based parametric method for the multipurpose batch scheduling problem with a fractional objective. The proposed hybrid algorithms can tackle optimization problems formulated as mixed-integer linear and mixed-integer fractional programs, respectively, and provide feasibility guarantees. Performance comparison between state-of-the-art exact and heuristic solvers and the proposed QC-based hybrid solution techniques is presented for both job-shop and batch scheduling problems. Unlike conventional classical solution techniques, the proposed hybrid frameworks harness quantum annealing to supplement established deterministic optimization algorithms and demonstrate performance efficiency over standard off-the-shelf optimization solvers.  © 2020 IEEE.},

This research aims to address an energy-efficient scheduling problem of production and shipping for minimizing both makespan and energy consumption. It contributes to an integrated energy-efficient production and shipping system, which is separately studied in most existing research. The production stage allocates jobs onto unrelated parallel machines that can be shut off and adjust their cutting speed to save energy. The shipping stage aims to allocate jobs to vehicles of various sizes with varied unit energy consumption. The problem is modelled as a mixed-integer quadratic program. Considering its complexity, a memetic algorithm (MA) is proposed to incorporate a knowledge-driven local search strategy considering the balance between exploration and exploitation. Two dominance rules are derived from the characteristics of the specific problem and embedded into the proposed MA to enhance its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MA outperforms two other population-based algorithms, genetic algorithm and traditional MA, in terms of performance and computing time.

	abstract = {Problem definition: We consider the intraday scheduling problem in a group of orthopaedic clinics where the planner schedules appointment times, given a sequence of appointments. We consider patient re-entry-where patients may be required to go for an x-ray examination, returning to the same doctor they have seen-and variability in patient behaviours such as walk-ins, earliness, and no-shows, which leads to inefficiency such as long patient waiting time and physician overtime. Academic/practical relevance: In our data set, 25% of the patients are required to go for x-ray examination. We also found significant variability in patient behaviours. Hence, patient re-entry and variability in behaviours are common, but we found little in the literature that could handle them. Methodology: We formulate the problem as a two-stage optimization problem, where scheduling decisions are made in the first stage. Queue dynamics in the second stage are modeled under a P-Queue paradigm, which minimizes a risk index representing the chance of violating performance targets, such as patient waiting times. The model reduces to a sequence of mixed-integer linear-optimization problems. Results: Our model achieves significant reductions, in comparative studies against a sample average approximation (SAA) model, on patient waiting times, while keeping server overtime constant. Our simulations further characterize the types of uncertainties under which SAA performs poorly. Managerial insights: We present an optimization model that is easy to implement in practice and tractable to compute. Our simulations indicate that not accounting for patient re-entry or variability in patient behaviours will lead to suboptimal policies, especially when they have specific structure that should be considered. © 2021 INFORMS},

In this paper, we study two issues of these networks: first, the scheduling of freight trains in a single-line corridor while ensuring safe interactions and second, the allocation of freight-to-freight trains regarding the release dates of freight, weight of freight, and weight capacity of the trains. Both of these issues must be addressed when examining real-world freight train scheduling problems. The objective functions of this study are the minimization of a train's travelling time, the allocation of freight-to-freight trains, and the reduction of tardiness of freight at destination. Both scheduling and allocation problems are presented using integer linear programming models. In addition, an integrated novel heuristic algorithm has been proposed to solve them. Computational results demonstrated through a generated dataset show both model validation and efficiency of the heuristic algorithm. The heuristic algorithm has been designed to incorporate the practical operational railway rules with modest modification. Although its outputs slightly differ from the exact solutions, it can solve both models simultaneously in large-scale problems.  © 2022 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.},

The substance of some parameters in the mentioned problems is uncertain. Ignoring the uncertainty of these parameters in the pavement maintenance scheduling problems may lead to suboptimal solutions and unstable pavement conditions. In this study, annual budget and pavement deterioration rate are considered uncertain parameters. On the other hand, pavement agencies generally face large-scale pavement networks. The complexity of the proposed stochastic model increases exponentially with the number of network sections and scenarios. The problem is solved using the Progressive Hedging Algorithm (PHA), which is suitable for large-scale stochastic programming problems, by achieving an effective decomposition over scenarios. A modified adaptive strategy for choosing the penalty parameter value is applied that aims to improve the solution process. A pavement network including 251 sections is considered the case study for this investigation, and the current study seeks optimal maintenance scheduling over a finite analysis period.

	abstract = {As the energy demand keeps growing with the world's increasing population, concerns have arisen about the carbon emissions that contribute to critical environmental issues. These environmental concerns drive many nations to commit themselves in pursuing sustainable energy resources. Different process integration techniques have been developed to achieve a viable energy planning sector. In reference to the literature review, the use of time-sliced based models in optimization problems is still sparse. Hence, this paper aims to develop a time-sliced based optimization model that can be integrated into energy integration models. With that, a multi-period pinch-based methodology (targeting, scheduling, and optimization) for electric power systems with the hybridization of renewables and fossil-based energy is proposed. The prospective framework is designed to meet the emissions limit, fulfil energy demand, and minimize the electricity bill. An illustrative case study in Malaysia incorporated with an actual billing system is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that it is capable of reducing the total electricity bill by 35% and achieving a 71% reduction of emissions by using solar PV as the renewables. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The vehicles have a homogeneous limited capacity and have their starting point and return in a warehouse or initial node, in addition, multiple variants of the classic VRP vehicle routing problem are considered, where computational complexity increases with the increase in the number of customers to visit, as a characteristic of an NP-hard problem. The solution method used consists of two connected phases, the first phase makes the allocation through a mixed-integer linear programming model, from which the visit program and its frequency in a determined planning horizon are obtained. In the second phase, the customers are grouped through an unsupervised learning algorithm, the routing is carried out through an Ant Colony Optimization metaheuristic that includes local heu-ristics to make sure compliance with the restrictive factors. Finally, we test our algorithm by performance measures using instances of the literature and a comparative model, and we prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2022 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of distributed machine learning (ML) frameworks, which exploit the massive parallelism of computing clusters to expedite ML training. However, the proliferation of distributed ML frameworks also introduces many unique technical challenges in computing system design and optimization. In a networked computing cluster that supports a large number of training jobs, a key question is how to design efficient scheduling algorithms to allocate workers and parameter servers across different machines to minimize the overall training time. Toward this end, in this paper, we develop an online scheduling algorithm that jointly optimizes resource allocation and locality decisions. Our main contributions are three-fold: i) We develop a new analytical model that considers both resource allocation and locality; ii) Based on an equivalent reformulation and observations on the worker-parameter server locality configurations, we transform the problem into a mixed packing and covering integer program, which enables approximation algorithm design; iii) We propose a meticulously designed approximation algorithm based on randomized rounding and rigorously analyze its performance. Collectively, our results contribute to the state of the art of distributed ML system optimization and algorithm design.  © 2013 IEEE.},

By taking the operation of the Chinese high-speed railway EMU trains as the actual background and using the actual situation that the first-level inspection and repair cycle time is twice the cycle of a high-speed railway train timetable, based on the establishment of a 48-hour continuous network, a 0-1 type integer linear programming model is constructed. While obtaining the rolling stock scheduling of EMU trains, the EMU train passing station route scheme is obtained. The experimental results show that, compared with solving the problem in two stages, the comprehensive optimization according to the method in this paper can better ensure the feasibility of the passing station route scheme and provide decision support for the actual operation.  © 2022 Yajing Zheng et al.},

To alleviate increasingly serious congestion and further reduce the risk of cross-infection, a novel two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model is explicitly constructed, in which the probability distribution of stochastic scenarios is only partially known in advance. In the proposed model, the mean-conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) criterion is employed to obtain a tradeoff between the expected number of waiting passengers and the risk of congestion on an urban rail transit line. The relationship between the proposed DRO model and the traditional two-stage stochastic programming (SP) model is also depicted. Furthermore, to overcome the obstacle of model solvability resulting from imprecise probability distributions, a discrepancy-based ambiguity set is used to transform the robust counterpart into its computationally tractable form. A hybrid algorithm that combines a local search algorithm with a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) solver is developed to improve the computational efficiency of large-scale instances. Finally, a series of numerical examples with real-world operation data are executed to validate the proposed approaches. © 2021 THE AUTHORS},

	abstract = {Over the last years, there have been initiated several pilots with autonomous minibusses. Unlike regular bus services, autonomous minibusses serve a limited number of stops and have more flexible schedules since they do not require bus drivers. This allows the operation of a line through a flexible combination of sublines, where a subline serves a subset of consecutive stops in the same order as the original line. This paper studies the subline frequency setting (SFS) problem under uncertain passenger demand. We present a frequency setting model that assigns autonomous minibusses to sublines in order to exploit the available resources as much as possible and minimize the operational and passenger waiting time costs. Passenger waiting time costs may depend on the combination of several lines whose frequencies cannot be perfectly aligned for each passenger journey. We present a new estimation of the expected waiting time for passengers to improve the accuracy of the passenger waiting time costs in the case of sublines. Our SFS model is originally formulated as a MINLP and reformulated as a MILP that can be solved to global optimality. Further, we explicitly consider the uncertainty of passenger demand in the optimization process by formulating a stochastic optimization model. The performances of our stochastic and deterministic models that assign minibusses to sublines are tested under various passenger demand scenarios in the 14-stop autonomous minibus line in Eberbach, Germany and a fictional bus line with 20 bus stops. Results show potential improvements in operational costs in the range of 10%–40% depending on the passenger demand profile. © 2021 The Author(s)},

Mixed-integer linear programming is leveraged to find the optimal operations of the servicers over a given period, whereas the rolling horizon approach is used to consider a long time horizon accounting for the uncertainties in service demand.

A fleet of transporters is given, each of which can only process a limited volume at a time. After processing its share, a transporter must rest for a short time before being able to process another part. This time is only dependent on the assigned job, not on the transporter. Other transporters can take over the processing while a transporter rests. Transporters assigned to the same job wait for their turn in a queue. A transporter can only be assigned to one job. Our goal is to simultaneously minimize the maximum job completion time and the number of assigned transporters by computing the frontier of Pareto optimal solutions. In general, we show that it is NP-hard in the strong sense to compute even a single point on the Pareto frontier. We provide exact methods and heuristics to compute the Pareto frontier for the general problem and compare them computationally. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

We propose a mixed-integer linear programming formulation based on the weighted sum method to obtain the Pareto front. We also developed an NSGA-II method to address large instances of the problem since the formulation cannot solve it in an acceptable computational time for decision-making. The results showed that the proposed NSGA-II is able to find a good approximation for the Pareto front when compared with the weighted sum method in small instances. In a large number of instances, NSGA-II outperforms, with a 95% confidence level, the MOGA and NSGA-I multi-objective techniques concerning the hypervolume and hierarchical cluster counting metrics. Thus, the proposed algorithm finds non-dominated solutions with good convergence, diversity, uniformity, and amplitude. © 2022 Rego et al. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {A mathematical model is introduced to solve a mobile workforce management problem. In such a problem there are a number of tasks to be executed at different locations by various teams. For example, when an electricity utility company has to deal with planned system upgrades and damages caused by storms. The aim is to determine the schedule of the teams in such a way that the overall cost is minimal. The mobile workforce management problem involves scheduling. The following questions should be answered: when to perform a task, how to route vehicles—the vehicle routing problem—and the order the sites should be visited and by which teams. These problems are already complex in themselves. This paper proposes an integrated mathematical programming model formulation, which, by the assignment of its binary variables, can be easily included in heuristic algorithmic frameworks. In the problem specification, a wide range of parameters can be set. This includes absolute and expected time windows for tasks, packing and unpacking in case of team movement, resource utilization, relations between tasks such as precedence, mutual exclusion or parallel execution, and team-dependent travelling and execution times and costs. To make the model able to solve larger problems, an algorithmic framework is also implemented which can be used to find heuristic solutions in acceptable time. This latter solution method can be used as an alternative. Computational performance is examined through a series of test cases in which the most important factors are scaled. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The coordination of interconnected elements across the different layers of the supply chain is essential for all industrial processes and the key to optimal decision-making. Yet, the modeling and optimization of such interdependent systems are still burdensome. In this paper, we address the simultaneous modeling and optimization of medium-term planning and short-term scheduling problems under demand uncertainty using mixed-integer bi-level multi-follower programming and data-driven optimization. Bi-level multi-follower programs model the natural hierarchy between different layers of supply chain management holistically, while scenario analysis and data-driven optimization allow us to retrieve the guaranteed feasible solutions of the integrated formulation under various demand considerations. We address the data-driven optimization of this challenging class of problems using the DOMINO framework, which was initially developed to solve single-leader single-follower bi-level optimization problems to guaranteed feasibility. This framework is extended to solve single-leader multi-follower stochastic formulations and its performance is characterized by well-known single and multi-product process scheduling case studies. Through our data-driven algorithmic approach, we present guaranteed feasible solutions to linear and nonlinear mixed-integer bi-level formulations of simultaneous planning and scheduling problems and further characterize the effects of the scheduling level complexity on the solution performance, which spans over several hundred continuous and binary variables, and thousands of constraints. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

In particular, the resulting model is linear in the max-plus algebra, and SMPL systems can switch between modes, an interesting feature due to the presence of vessel routing and ordering constraints in the model. Moreover, SMPL systems can be transformed into mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems, for which efficient solvers are available.

	abstract = {This paper presents the development and mathematical implementation of a production scheduling model utilizing mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). A simplified model of a real-world multi-product batch plant constitutes the basis. The paper shows practical extensions to the model, resulting in a digital twin of the plant. Apart from sequential arrangement, the final model contains maintenance periods, campaign planning and storage constraints to a limited extend. To tackle weak computational performance and missing model features, a condensed mathematical formulation is introduced at first. After stating that these measures do not suffice for applicability in a restrained time period, a novel solution strategy is proposed. The overall non-iterative algorithm comprises a multi-step decomposition approach, which starts with a reduced scope and incrementally complements the schedule in multiple subproblem stages. Each of those optimizations holds less decision variables and makes use of warmstart information obtained from the predecessor model. That way, a first feasible solution accelerates the subsequent improvement process. Furthermore, the optimization focus can be shifted beneficially leveraging the Gurobi solver parameters. Findings suggest that correlation may exist between certain characteristics of the scheduling scope and ideal parameter settings, which yield potential for further investigation. Another promising area for future research addresses the concurrent multi-processing of independent MILPs on a single machine. First observations indicate that significant performance gains can be achieved in some cases, though sound dependencies were not discovered yet. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {It is commonly seen that buses are blocked by the ones in front serving passengers and have to queue outside a curbside bus stop although there are vacant berths at the stop. The resultant bus delays degrade the service level of urban public transportation. A potential solution is to reschedule the arrivals of the buses at the stop for full utilization of the berths with the aid of connected vehicle technologies. This study proposes a mixed-integer linear programming model to optimize the scheduling of bus arrivals and the bus-berth matching at a curbside stop under the connected vehicle environment. The objective is the minimization of the bus delays weighted by the number of passengers on the buses. Bus arrival times at the stop and the assignment of berths are optimized together with bus departure times from the stop. Bus punctuality is also taken into consideration. The proposed model could be applied dynamically to cater to time-varying traffic conditions. Numerical studies validate the advantages of the proposed model over the "first-come-first-service"strategy and the relaxed model without bus punctuality in terms of weighted bus delays and bus punctuality. Sensitivity analyses show that (1) the proposed model is robust to the fluctuation of bus service time and (2) a smaller number of berths may be preferred on the condition that the bus demand does not exceed the stop capacity. © 2022 Shiqi Ou et al.},

Specifically, the model quantifies aircraft electrical load based on passenger' travel behavior, establishes a corresponding APU load characteristic model, and establishes an EV charging load profile based on the flight schedule and sequencing algorithm. A mixed-integer linear programming optimization method based on life cycle theory was proposed to minimize the total costs of hydrogen-integrated energy systems for airports (HIES). However, the resilience advantages of hydrogen energy concerning power failure are little explored in existing academic research. Thus, a resilience assessment method and improvement measure were proposed for HIES.

By individuals sharing their commutes, vehicle occupancy increases and congestion is reduced. We develop a dynamic ADL (Arnott, de Palma, Lindsey)–Vickrey approach for a corridor monocentric city à la Hotelling. First, we formulate the matching problem of heterogeneous users in carpooling as an MILP problem and we discuss its analytical properties when there is no congestion. Next, we construct a bi-level optimization problem involving matching (first stage) and dynamic traffic congestion with scheduling preferences (second stage) when congestion is endogenous. We provide a heuristic to attain an optimal matching for a dynamic traffic equilibrium with congestion.

	abstract = {In this paper we consider the train unit shunting problem extended with service task scheduling. This problem originates from Dutch Railways, which is the main railway operator in the Netherlands. Its urgency stems from the upcoming expansion of the rolling stock fleet needed to handle the ever-increasing number of passengers. The problem consists of matching train units arriving on a shunting yard to departing trains, scheduling service tasks such as cleaning and maintenance on the available resources, and parking the trains on the available tracks such that the shunting yard can operate conflict-free. These different aspects lead to a computationally extremely difficult problem, which combines several well-known NP-hard problems. In this paper, we present the first solution method covering all aspects of the shunting and scheduling problem. We describe a partial order schedule representation that captures the full problem, and we present a local search algorithm that utilizes the partial ordering. The proposed solution method is compared with an existing mixed integer linear program in a computational study on realistic instances provided by Dutch Railways. We show that our local search algorithm is the first method to solve real-world problem instances of the complete shunting and scheduling problem. It even outperforms current algorithms when the train unit shunting problem is considered in isolation, that is, without service tasks. Although our method was developed for the case of the Dutch Railways, it is applicable to any shunting yard or service location, irrespective of its layout, that uses self-propelling train units and that does not have to handle passing trains.

	abstract = {Home healthcare, a novel type of health treatment provided at residents' homes for specific populations (elderly, disabled), is typically less expensive, more convenient, and efficient. The purpose of this article is to offer a paradigm for scheduling medical professionals from various medical institutes. With the need for home health care likely to expand significantly, future work is critical to lowering costs and ensuring service quality. The high expense of hiring nurses and doctors in this home health system (HHS) necessitates optimization approaches. To handle choice difficulties, we present a new algorithm that generates numerous scenarios, including current nurse schedules, the new demand under discussion, and future requests generated by the system. By analyzing several real-life factors and a new algorithm that produces numerous situations involving nurses' schedules to solve three problems, the model offered is integer number programming. The results indicate which center each nurse is dispatched from, and each nurse returns to the original routing point. Finally, average daily visits increase by roughly 20%, while daily travel times of each visit drop by 50%.  © 2022 Ali Ala et al.},

	abstract = {Timetabling for railway services often aims at optimizing travel times for passengers. At the same time, restricting assumptions on passenger behavior and passenger modeling are made. While research has shown that discrete choice models are suitable to estimate the distribution of passengers on routes, this has not been considered in timetabling yet. We investigate how to integrate a passenger distribution into an optimization framework for timetabling and present two mixed integer linear programs for this problem. Both approaches design timetables and simultaneously find a corresponding passenger distribution on available routes. One model uses a linear distribution model to estimate passenger route choices. The other model uses an integrated simulation framework to approximate a passenger distribution according to the logit model, a commonly used route choice model. We compare both new approaches with three state-of-the-art timetabling methods and a heuristic approach on a set of artificial instances and a partial network of Netherlands Railways (NS). Our experiments provide insights into the impact of considering multiple routes instead of a single route, and of integrated route choice versus predetermined route assignment with respect to the solution quality. © 2021 The Author(s)},

To provide more feasible schedules with respect to the DSN requirements, \Delta -MILP incorporates new sets of constraints including 1) splitting larger tracks into shorter segments and 2) preventing overlapping between tracks on different antennas. Additionally, \Delta -MILP leverages a heuristic to balance mission satisfaction and allows to prioritize certain missions in special scenarios including emergencies and landings. Numerical validations demonstrate that \Delta -MILP now satisfies 100% of the requested constraints and provides fair schedules amongst missions with respect to the state-of-The-Art for the most oversubscribed weeks of the years 2016 and 2018. © 2013 IEEE.},

These reforms raise questions regarding the roles of market operators in energy-storage management and the design of market-participation models and offer parameters for energy storage. This paper examines the market implications of energy-storage participation models and state-of-energy (SOE) management. To this end, we develop a bi-level stochastic optimization model, wherein the upper level represents a profit-maximizing energy-storage firm offering into a wholesale market. Lower-level problems represent market clearing under different uncertain operating conditions. Using complementarity theory and binary expansion, this model is recast as a single-level mixed-integer linear optimization problem, which can be solved using off-the-shelf software packages. We apply the model to an illustrative example and a comprehensive case study. We demonstrate that with uncertainty, self scheduling energy storage is suboptimal for the energy-storage firm. Relying on only the energy-storage firm to manage SOE can yield strategic behavior, whereby infeasible offers are submitted to affect dispatch and market prices. These findings can guide ongoing market-design reforms.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Deep Space Network (DSN) is responsible for communication and navigation for several NASA and international missions. The DSN comprises three complexes located in Goldstone (California, USA), Cambera (Australia), and Madrid (Spain). This distribution in longitude guarantees a full sky coverage. Each complex has one 70-m and several 34-m antennas. The network routinely serves a few dozen missions. The scheduling of the DSN is complex and involves human interventions as well as automated solutions. In order to increase the level of automation, different computing paradigms have been explored. In this article, we report on the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation of the DSN scheduling, as well as a custom classical solver designed around some of the unique features of this scheduling problem. Thanks to a hybrid framework that extends the size of the problems that can be solved with a quantum annealer, we are able to generate a schedule from the QUBO formulation of the problem for one week's worth of user antenna requests, which represents the time period scheduled during operation. In other words, this work describes a real-world application of quantum annealing using real-world, operational data. We compare the resulting schedules' quality to solutions obtained using a mixed-integer linear programming formulation on a commercial solver. Our custom solver, based on a quantum-inspired optimization technique called substochatic Monte Carlo, while much faster in generating schedules, could only treat a subset of requests, and hence, we report its results independently.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the increasing uptake of electric vehicles (EVs), the need for efficient scheduling of EV charging is becoming increasingly important. A charging station operator needs to identify charging/discharging power of the client EVs over a time horizon while considering multiple objectives, such as operating costs and the peak power drawn from the grid. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are a popular choice when faced with problems involving multiple objectives. However, since the objectives and constraints of this problem can be expressed using linear functions, it is also possible to come up with improvised multi-objective formulations which can be solved with exact techniques such as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). With both approaches having their potential strengths and pitfalls, it is worth investigating their use to inform the algorithmic choices, which this study aims to address. In doing so, it makes a number of contributions to the topic, including extension of an existing EV charging problem to a multi-objective form; observing some interesting properties of the problem to improve both the MILP and EA solution approaches; and comparing the performance of MILP and EA. The study provides some useful insights into the problem, initial results and quantitative basis for selecting solution approaches, and highlights some areas of further development.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Airport ferry vehicles are used to transport passengers between the far apron and terminals. During the peak hours of flight arrival or departure, the demand for ferry vehicles will increase, and improper scheduling will result in significant delays. In this study, we construct a 0-1 integer programming scheduling model for ferry vehicles with multiple objectives: minimize flight delays and vehicle travel distances and balance vehicle workloads when there is an insufficient number of ferry vehicles. To solve the multiobjective model, this study selects the second version of the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II as the main framework and designs a modified coding and decoding scheme to solve the constraint problem in the model. The proposed model and algorithm are verified using actual data from Kunming Changshui International Airport, China. Compared with the scheduling method of manual first come first serve, the total delay time of the proposed model is reduced by 24.52%, the transit distance by 6.63%, and the balance index by 24.05%, which helps the airport solve the problem of insufficient ferry vehicles during peak hours. Comparison results show that the proposed model has a shorter calculation time and better distribution of solution sets than three state-of-the-art multiobjective optimization algorithms: MOPSO, MOACO, and SPEA-II. This research can help airports reduce flight delays, vehicle purchases, and operation costs.  © 2022 Jun Bi et al.},

	abstract = {The garment industry in Vietnam is one of the country's strongest industries in the world. However, the production process still encounters problems regarding scheduling that does not equate to an optimal process. The paper introduces a production scheduling solution that resolves the potential delays and lateness that hinders the production process using integer programming and order allocation with a make-to-order manufacturing viewpoint. A number of constraints were considered in the model and is applied to a real case study of a factory in order to view how the tardiness and lateness would be affected which resulted in optimizing the scheduling time better. Specifically, the constraints considered were order assignments, production time, and tardiness with an objective function which is to minimize the total cost of delay. The results of the study precisely the overall cost of delay of the orders given to the plant and successfully propose a suitable production schedule that utilizes the most of the plant given.

	abstract = {With the industry sustainable development and increasing awareness of energy conservation, many manufacturing enterprises prefer to develop the operation and maintenance (O&M) with high production throughput and low energy consumption. In reality, many manufacturing systems are required to conduct a sequence of predefined missions with finite breaks between any two consecutive missions. To successfully complete the next mission production, maintenance actions are arranged and performed on machines during each scheduled break. In this paper, an energy-oriented selective maintenance policy (ESMP) for series–parallel systems is investigated. At each break, multiple maintenance actions with different impacts on machine degradation are available under limited maintenance resources. To obtain the throughput-and-energy based maintenance scheme, we first model the system energy efficiency based on system throughput and energy consumption. Then, we integer the energy efficiency modeling, production throughout analysis, and selective maintenance scheduling into an optimization model. And the model objective is to find the appropriate maintenance action for each machine at each break subject to cost and duration constraints. Numerical examples have been addressed to demonstrate the performance and adaptability of our proposed ESMP in long-term selective maintenance scheduling. Finally, a comparative analysis with traditional reliability-oriented policy shows the significant improvement of energy efficiency. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The scheduling and optimization of short-term hydrothermal operation utilize the water resources efficiently and magnify the benefits of hydro energy while reducing the fuel and operation cost of thermal power plants. Short-term hydrothermal operation is a complex non-linear and non-convex optimization problem, which reflects thermal valve point effects, load balances, generation bounds and water transport delay. It is highly important and significant to figure out these problems to maximize the benefits of hydrothermal joint operation for energy saving, emission reduction and efficient resources management. This article presents a 1D linearization technique to deal with the non-linear function of two variables, a combined mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and non-linear programming (NLP) method to solve this problem. The applied method introduces integer variables to linearize the original model into a MILP one; the solution by MILP is then corrected and re-optimized to formulate a feasible solution to warm start NLP. The 1D linearization method is efficient for MILP as it avoids the coupled relationships of integer variables, and the NLP local search is used to correct the influence of linearization errors and search further. The case studies show that the result derived by the 1D linearization-based MILP-NLP method is superior to that of previous works. The method is tested with different linearization accuracy, and the results demonstrate that the method is stable. The presented technique is promising for real-world hydrothermal operation and related problems.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

	abstract = {Distributed generation (DG) is becoming increasingly important due to the serious environmental pollution caused by conventional fossil-energy-based generation and the depletion of non-renewable energy. As the flexible resources in the active distribution network (ADN), battery energy system (BES) and responsive load (RL) are all able to assist renewable DG integration in day-ahead dispatch. In addition, the security and economic level can be significantly improved by adjusting network topology. Therefore, in this paper, a coordinated day-ahead scheduling method incorporating topology reconfiguration, BES optimization and load response is presented to minimize the total day-ahead operational costs in the ADN. Linearized current injection models are presented for renewable DG, RL and BES based on the linear power flow model, and an extensible linear switching operations calculation (ELSOC) method is proposed to address the network reconfiguration. Thus, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed for optimal coordinated operation of an ADN. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated by simulations on a modified test system. In addition, the combined scenario and Monte-Carlo method is used to handle the uncertainties of loads and DGs, and the results of different uncertainties can further verify the feasibility of the proposed model.  © 2015 CSEE.},

	abstract = {Under the modern environment, the reconstruction of enterprise's core competitiveness depends not only on capital and technical strength, but also on the overall strength of its human resources. At the same time, effective allocation and rational use of talents are needed to create good performance for enterprises. Enterprise human resource management is the key part of the whole enterprise management. At the same time, it is also a necessary preparation for the continuous development and innovation of enterprises. In the whole process of human resource management, the core work is person-post matching. Only by promoting the reasonable implementation of person-post matching can other management work be carried out smoothly. This paper expounds two major elements in human resource management, namely, the concept and measurement of person-post matching and the principle of person-post matching. And the factors in the matching of people and posts are analyzed. This paper probes into the implementation of person-post matching in enterprise human resource management. Based on this, this paper puts forward a depth model of accurate matching between people and posts based on ability perception. On the basis of studying the optimization of human resource scheduling, this paper takes into account three factors: resource constraints, heterogeneity of employee efficiency and time sequence relationship, and uses integer linear programming theory to model the system with the shortest construction period as the goal. The research shows that the accuracy of this algorithm can reach about 94%, which is about 8% higher than the traditional algorithm. It has certain superior performance. This will provide some reference for related researchers.  © 2022 Shaoze Zhang.},

	abstract = {Cloud service providers consistently leverage their computing infrastructures by adding reconfigurable hardware platforms such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to their existing infrastructures. Adding FPGAs to a cloud environment involves non-trivial challenges. The first challenge is virtualizing FPGAs as part of the cloud resources. As a standard virtualization framework is lacking, there is a need for an efficient framework for virtualizing FPGAs. Furthermore, FPGA resources are used in conjunction with central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate the execution of tasks. Therefore, to gain the benefits of these powerful accelerating platforms, the second challenge is to optimize the allocation of tasks into the capable resources within a cloud data center. This work proposes an FPGA virtualization framework that abstracts the physical FPGAs into virtual pools of FPGA resources. The work further presents an integer linear programming (ILP) optimization model to minimize the makespan of tasks where FPGA resources are part of the cloud data center. Given the complex nature of the problem, a simulated annealing (SA) metaheuristic is developed to achieve gains in performance compared to the exact method and to scale up and handle many tasks and resources while providing near-optimal solutions. Experimental results show that SA has reduced the makespan of a large dataset with 1000 tasks and 100 resources by up to 30% when compared to first-come-first-served (FCFS) and shortest-deadline-first (SDF) algorithms. Lastly, to quantify the performance of FPGA-enabled cloud datacenters, the work extends the CloudSim simulator (an open-source cloud simulator) to enable FPGA as a resource in its environment. The proposed virtualization framework and the SA scheduler are integrated into the environment. Simulation results show that the execution time of tasks is reduced by up to 78% when FPGA accelerators are used.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Day surgery scheduling allocates hospital resources to day surgical cases and decides on the time to perform the surgeries in the day surgery center (DSC). Based on the day surgery service process of large public hospitals in China, we found that the service efficiency of the process depends on the utilization of hospital resources efficiently and could be optimized through day surgery scheduling. We described it as a flexible flow shop owing to the three-station nature of surgery. Allocating all types of hospital resources to the three stations and determining the length of time for each stage during surgery are crucial to improving the efficiency of DSC. This paper integrates a three-station job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) into the day surgery scheduling and optimization problem. The JSSP was formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model, and the elicitation of the model for scheduling surgeries with different priorities in the DSC is discussed. The model illustrated a case study of the DSC within West China Hospital (WCH). Numerical experiments based on the genetic algorithm design were conducted. Compared to the other optimization strategies, we proposed that the three-station job shop scheduling strategy (TSJS) could not only improve the efficiency and reduce the waiting time of the patients of the DSC in large public hospitals in China but also allow for timely scheduling adjustments during the advent of emergency surgeries.  © 2022 Xue Bai et al.},

A novel mixed integer formulation is proposed with the objective of optimizing different normalized criteria related to the inventory and service level performance. Based on this mathematical formulation, a problem-based matheuristic method that solves the lot sizing and assignment problems separately is proposed to solve the industrial case. A computational study and sensitivity analysis are carried out based on real-world data with up to 170 products, 70 unrelated parallel machines and 42 periods. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach on improving the company's solution.

Existing works only focused on one or two of three sub-problems (offloading decision, task assignment and task ordering), leading to a sub-optimal solution. To address this issue, we first formulated the problem as a binary nonlinear programming, and proposed an integer particle swarm optimization method (IPSO) to solve the problem in a reasonable time.

	abstract = {The stochastic and intermittent nature of renewable energy poses grave challenges to the energy scheduling of micro-grids. The exploitation of batteries has been considered as an effective way to cope with such challenges. However, fluctuation in renewable process causes batteries to charge/discharge frequently, reducing the lifetime and increasing the maintenance cost. This paper presents a hierarchical two-layer energy management, a combination of battery and supercapacitor, to lessen daily energy costs. The upper layer is equipped with a battery to minimize the economic cost, optimizing the energy usage by employing a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model; the lower layer is equipped with a supercapacitor to treat the uncertain nature of renewable energy. The optimization process includes load shifting and battery degradation costs. The upper layer determines the optimal schedule of interruptible appliances and the profile for energy storage for the next 24 hours. The schedule results are then passed to the lower layer, which deals with the forecast uncertainties with a supercapacitor with a 15 minutes interval. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is examined by a single-layer scheduling system without forecast errors and a two-layer scheduling system with forecast errors.

	abstract = {Nowadays the steel market is becoming ever more competitive for European steelworks, especially as far as flat steel products are concerned. As such competition determines the price products, profit can be increased only by lowering production and commercial costs. Production yield can be significantly increased through an appropriate scheduling of the semi-manufactured products among the available sub-processes, to ensure that customers' orders are timely completed, resources are optimally exploited, and delays are minimized. Therefore, an ever-increasing attention is paid toward production optimization through efficient scheduling strategies in the scientific and industrial communities. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to improve the flexibility of production scheduling in steelworks producing flat steel products. Such approach combines three methods holding different scopes and modelling different aspects: an auction-based multi-agent system is applied to face production uncertainties, multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming is used for global optimal scheduling of resources under steady conditions, while a continuous flow model copes with long-term production scheduling. According to the obtained simulation results, the integration and combination of these three approaches allow scheduling production in a flexible way by providing the capability to adapt to different production conditions.  © 2022 - The authors.

	abstract = {We propose an energy management algorithm for isolated industrial power systems that integrate uncertain renewable generation and energy storage. The proposed strategy is designed to ensure sustainable and cost-effective operations by managing the energy flows in the grid, and is structured so to cope with: (1) high levels of renewable power penetration, and (2) load profiles characterized by non-smooth patterns and irregular events (i.e., events such as those occurring from connections/disconnections of large scale equipment, or from large wind speed ramps). The proposed algorithm leverages a stochastic economic model predictive control (MPC) scheme capable of dealing simultaneously with the dispatch and scheduling of the local generation units. More precisely, the scheme embeds a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimal control policy formulation together with a stochastic programming approach. Moreover, the optimization problem accounts for multiple techno-economical objectives, such as minimization of operational costs, battery degradation, and non-utilized energy. We test the algorithm on a case study of an isolated offshore Oil & Gas platform producing energy onsite with conventional gas turbines and a local wind farm, while integrating a battery energy storage system. The results show that the proposed approach can issue ensemble predictions that successfully capture the potential irregular variations just by using recent past information of the associated random variable, even when no particular sudden events are anticipated in the near-future (i.e., step changes/trend reversals). In this way, the approach provides useful future information for the optimal management of the grid. This effect is numerically quantified via simulations that compare the performance of the proposed stochastic optimization approach against its deterministic MPC version in several realistic operating conditions. The empirical results suggest that the stochastic version leads to better scheduling of the conventional generators, with up to 12.86% reductions of the operating cost, 2.56% reduction in fuel consumption and emissions, and 35.29% reduction in status transitions (on/off) of the gas turbines, while keeping dumped energy and battery degradation as low as possible. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and Terahertz (THz) technology are envisioned to play paramount roles in next-generation wireless communications. In this paper, we present a novel secure UAV-assisted mobile relaying system operating at THz bands for data acquisition from multiple ground user equipments (UEs) towards a destination. We assume that the UAV-mounted relay may act, besides providing relaying services, as a potential eavesdropper called the untrusted UAV-relay (UUR). To safeguard end-to-end communications, we present a secure two-phase transmission strategy with cooperative jamming. Then, we devise an optimization framework in terms of a new measure $-$ secrecy energy efficiency (SEE), defined as the ratio of achievable average secrecy rate to average system power consumption, which enables us to obtain the best possible security level while taking UUR's inherent flight power limitation into account. For the sake of quality of service fairness amongst all the UEs, we aim to maximize the minimum SEE (MSEE) performance via the joint design of key system parameters, including UUR's trajectory and velocity, communication scheduling, and network power allocation. Since the formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex optimization and computationally intractable, we decouple it into four subproblems and propose alternative algorithms to solve it efficiently via greedy/sequential block successive convex approximation and non-linear fractional programming techniques. Numerical results demonstrate significant MSEE performance improvement of our designs compared to other known benchmarks.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This study addresses a high-speed railway train timetable rescheduling (TTR) problem with a complete blockage at the station and train operation constraints. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that minimizes the weighted sum of the total delay time of trains. A memetic algorithm (MA) is proposed, and the individual of MA is represented as a permutation of trains’ departure order at the disrupted station. The individual is decoded to a feasible schedule of the trains using a rule-based method to allocate the running time in sections and dwell time at stations. Consequently, the original problem is reformulated as an unconstrained problem. Several permutation-based operators are involved, including crossover, mutation, and local search. A restart strategy was employed to maintain the the population diversity. The proposed MA was compared with the first-scheduled-first-served (FSFS) algorithm and other state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MA in solving the TTR through permutation-based optimization in terms of constraint handling, solution quality, and computation time. © Fuji Technology Press Ltd},

	abstract = {The complexity of current electricity wholesale markets and the increased volatility of electricity prices because of the intermittent nature of renewable generation make independent power producers (IPPs) face significant challenges to submit offers. This challenge increases for those owning traditional coal-fired thermal generators and renewable generation. In this paper, an integrated stochastic optimal strategy is proposed for an IPP using the self-scheduling approach through its participation in both day-ahead and realtime markets (i.e., two-settlement electricity markets) as a price taker. In the proposed approach, the IPP submits an offer for all periods to the day-aheadmarket for which amultistage stochastic programming setting is explored for providing real-time market offers for each period as a recourse. This strategy has the advantage of achieving overall maximum profits for both markets in the given operational time horizon. Such a strategy is theoretically proved to bemore profitable than alternative self-scheduling strategies as it takes advantage of the continuously realized scenario information of the renewable energy output and real-time prices over time. To improve computational efficiency, we explore polyhedral structures to derive strong valid inequalities, including convex hull descriptions for certain special cases, thus strengthening the formulation of our proposed model. Polynomial-time separation algorithms are then established for the derived exponentialsized inequalities to speed up the branch-and-cut process. Finally, both numerical and real case studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed strategy. © 2022 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences. All rights reserved.},

This problem was posed in the 2021 “IEEE-CIS Technical Challenge on Predict + Optimize for Renewable Energy Scheduling”. The target was to solve the two subtasks of forecasting the base load and of computing an optimal schedule of a list of energy intensive activities with inter-dependencies. We describe our approach to this challenge, which resulted in the third place of the leaderboard. For the prediction of the base load, we use a combination of a statistical and a machine learning approach. For the optimization of schedules, we employ a tuned mixed integer linear programming approach.

	abstract = {Due to the proliferation of requests in heterogeneous resources in edge computing, the existence of a large number of tasks and workloads in virtual machines in the edge computing environment is inevitable. Thus, load balancing strives to facilitate an even distribution of workload across available resources. Its purpose is to provide continuous service and to ensure fair load distribution among resources. Load balancing, with the aim of minimizing response time for tasks and improving resource efficiency, tries to do the proper mapping of tasks among virtual machines at a lower cost. Flow scheduling, on the other hand, assigns a task (group of tasks) to computational resources by prioritizing tasks, so that the relationship between them is maintained. Therefore, in this research, a hierarchical control framework for load balancing and assignment of tasks in edge computing services is presented in order to create load balancing. In the proposed method, in the first level, the genetic algorithm receives a set of tasks in a workflow. Genetic algorithm prioritizes and assigns tasks to resources according to time constraints, resource processing power, resource availability, and task cost. For this purpose, the integer linear programming optimization in the evaluation function of the genetic algorithm will be utilized. In the second level, considering the past load distribution in edge resources, we estimate the probability of load distribution among sources according to hidden Markov model (HMM). Finally, in order to optimally map tasks to the virtual machines in each host, we will use game theory with service quality factors as an evaluation function. Previous methods have provided a hierarchical control framework that aims to achieve conflicting goals within a data center, but does not use linear programming. Considering the use of service quality criteria as evaluation function parameters in heuristic and optimization methods in this research, it is expected that the results of this research will improve compared to previous methods.  © 2022 Rui Zhang et al.},

	abstract = {With the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, the problem of supply chain emergency scheduling has had a great influence on economic benefits of enterprises. The uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty of supply chain have made the problem of emergency scheduling more complicated. In this study, a multiobjective multiperiod mixed-integer programming optimization model was developed, in which two conflicting benefit factors, cost and service level were taken as the optimization target of the model. Cost and service level were normalized, and the weighted sum was taken as the objective function, which transformed the problem into a multiperiod nonlinear one. Two algorithms of Bi-level Modified Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (BMHGA) and Bi-level Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (BHGA) were designed to solve the model. Three emergency strategies have been proposed, including enabling alternative suppliers, repairing failure nodes and enabling internal suppliers' flexibility. The parameter of disruption scenario and its solution method were designed. Finally, the practicability of the proposed model and algorithm was demonstrated through application to a case study of an electronics supply chain. The results indicated that the optimal solution of two algorithms was between 2%-5%, and BMHGA could obtain a better optimal solution.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Network slicing is a promising technology that network operators can deploy the services by slices with heterogeneous quality of service (QoS) requirements. However, an orchestrator for network operation with efficient slice resource provisioning algorithms is essential. This work stands on Internet service provider (ISP) to design an orchestrator analyzing the critical influencing factors, namely access control, scheduling, and resource migration, to systematically evolve a sustainable network. The scalability and flexibility of resources are jointly considered. The resource management problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem. A solution approach based on Lagrangian relaxation (LR) is proposed for the orchestrator to make decisions to satisfy the high QoS applications. It can investigate the resources required for access control within a cost-efficient resource pool and consider allocating or migrating resources efficiently in each network slice. For high system utilization, the proposed mechanisms are modeled in a pay-as-you-go manner. Furthermore, the experiment results show that the proposed strategies perform the near-optimal system revenue to meet the QoS requirement by making decisions. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Today's IoT devices rely on batteries, which offer stable energy storage but contain harmful chemicals. Having billions of IoT devices powered by batteries is not sustainable for the future. As an alternative, batteryless devices run on long-lived capacitors charged using energy harvesters. The small energy storage capacity of capacitors results in intermittent on-off behaviour. Traditional computing schedulers can not handle this intermittency, and in this article we propose a first step towards an energy-aware task scheduler for constrained batteryless devices. We present a new energy-aware task scheduling algorithm that is able to optimally schedule application tasks to avoid power failures, and that will allow us to provide insights on the optimal look-ahead time for energy prediction. Our insights can be used as a basis for practical energy-aware scheduling and energy a vailability prediction algorithms. We formulate the scheduling problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program. We evaluate its performance improvement when comparing it with state-of-the-art schedulers for batteryless IoT devices. Our results show that making the task scheduler energy aware avoids power failures and allows more tasks to successfully execute. Moreover, we conclude that a relatively short look-ahead energy prediction time of 8 future task executions is enough to achieve optimality. © 2013 IEEE.},

Nuclear power plants, with a large ratio of capital to variable costs, have historically operated as base load energy suppliers but the need for more flexible operation is increasing. We simulate the techno-economic performance of a 950 MWt nuclear power plant, based on the Westinghouse lead-cooled fast reactor, coupled with molten salt thermal storage as a method for flexible energy dispatch. We use the System Advisor Model to model the nuclear reactor thermal power input and power cycle operating modes. We combine this robust engineering model with a mixed-integer linear program model for optimized dispatch scheduling. We then simulate the coupled nuclear and thermal storage system under different market scenarios with varying price volatility. We find that the coupled plant outperforms the base plant under markets where energy price peaks fluctuate by a factor of two or more about the mean price. We show that a calculated power purchase agreement price for the plant improves by up to 10% when operating under California energy market conditions.

	abstract = {Compared to a charging scheduling and management problem characterized by predetermined trip assignment, this study takes bus and driver scheduling into account, and mealtime windows must be guaranteed as one of the major labor regulations. A discretized mixed-integer linear programming (MIPL) model is developed based on a single electric bus route. We aim to obtain fast and high-quality global solutions for this problem, and the model can be easily executed by bus operators by directly invoking an available optimization solver such as IBM ILOG CPLEX. We test our model on a real round-trip bus route. Numerical experiments show that CPLEX takes approximately 6 sec to obtain an optimal solution. The model can not only reasonably arrange daily trips for each electric bus and driver but also effectively determine the optimal charging schedule and management for an electric bus line. Besides, we analyze the sensitivity of the key parameters in the model. With the increase in the drivers' maximum workload, the drivers' average idle time decreases by approximately 11.25%. The objective value decreases by approximately 38.71% and 40.04% with increases in the battery capacity and fleet size, respectively, and the objective value increases by approximately 30.06% with the decrease in the initial battery driving range. In addition, we compare the effectiveness of our time discretization modeling method in solving the same case study to that from other similar studies, and the validity of our method can be verified by the calculation time. We also compare the computational efficiency of CPLEX in solving the same case study problem with and without implementing valid inequalities, and the computational efficiency of the valid inequality method is greatly improved. Finally, through the testing of a multiline network, the potential application of the model to a large-scale traffic network is verified.  © 2022 Yang Jiang and Tong He.},

The proposed model incorporates corresponding loading factors for each type of electrical, heating, and cooling loads. This is done to assess the maximum loadability of the whole system. In this respect, the chance-constrained approach is implemented for the feasibility assessment of the operation problem with uncertainties. The uncertainties which are assumed here include the forecast errors of electrical, heating, and cooling load demands, and the volatile solar power generation. The overall problem formulation is developed in the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework. The standard chance-constrained approach is converted to a deterministic optimization model by utilizing the Big M method. The main objective of the proposed model is to maximize the loadability index with uncertainties while addressing the permissible risk index of the decision-maker. The studied energy hub comprises electrical, heating, and cooling loads, and the energy flow technique is adopted in this paper to model the load balance equations.

	abstract = {With the emergence of innovations associated with public transport (PT) services, such as Mobility-as-a-Service, demand responsive transit, and autonomous vehicles, the door-to-door PT journey is achievable via multiple transfers between and within different PT modes. As such, seamless transfers between different modes of public transportation become an increasingly important factor for the attractiveness of PT services. At the same time, recent developments in travel time prediction methodologies offer new, reliable data sources for the optimization of PT operations. This work, with the consideration of these two elements, develops a mixed integer linear programming model for the PT schedule synchronization problem. The novelty is threefold. First, a novel concept of path-oriented scheduling is proposed. The path transfer time is explicitly formulated and minimized to provide a seamless travel experience considering that the emerging multimodal mobility inevitably induces multiple transfers. Second, time-dependent travel time data is also utilized in the model, which allows us to harness new and more representative data sources for improving PT services. Third, in order to complement the increase in computational complexity as a result of the utilization of time-dependent travel time data, three novel valid inequalities (VIs) are derived. Numerical studies show that the use of time-dependent travel time data is beneficial in terms of reducing path transfer times, when compared to using the mean historical travel times. The numerical study also reveals a tradeoff between the maximum allowable path transfer time and trip time. Using simulation studies on three bus lines in Copenhagen, we demonstrate that the valid inequalities could reduce the computation time by 8.5% on average, where the maximum reduction of computation time could reach 54.0%. The proposed valid inequalities are benchmarked against two classes of valid inequalities in the literature. It is found that the proposed valid inequalities could outperform those in the literature. We also found that further improvement in computational performance can be attained by using a combination of the proposed valid inequalities. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {With the development of technology, shared autonomous vehicles may become one of the main traffic modes in the future. Especially, shared autonomous vehicle reservation system, commuting, and other trips with fixed departure time mostly submit their travel requests in advance. Therefore, it is important to reasonably match shared autonomous vehicles and reservation demands. In this paper, reservation requests are divided into short-term and long-term requests by inputting requests in a more realistic way. An integer linear programming model considering operator scheduling cost and system service level is established. A detailed scheme considering rolling horizon continuity and ridesharing is used to improve the dispatching result. Based on traffic data in Delft, the Netherlands, 164 scenarios are tested in which the parking cost, fuel cost, ridesharing effect, service level, and network size are analyzed. The results show that a better relocation and ridesharing matching scheme can be obtained when the rolling horizon is small, while the overall effect is better when the rolling horizon is large. Moreover, the buffer time, distance, and travel time limit for vehicle relocation should be selected according to the request quantity and the calculation time requirement. The result can provide a suggestion for the dispatching of shared autonomous vehicle reservation system with ridesharing.  © 2022 Yizhe Yang et al.},

The instances used in this paper were constructed under a new approach which results in tighter due dates than the previous generation method for this problem. The proposed MILP formulation was able to solve instances of up to 150 jobs and 20 machines. Regarding the ILS, it yielded high-quality solutions in a reasonable time, solving instances of a size up to 400 jobs and 20 machines. Experimental results confirm that both approaches are efficient and promising. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Regional air mobility refers to the transportation of passengers aboard small aircraft over short distances. These operations are challenging due to low passenger volumes, competing transportation modes, and high operating costs. Nevertheless, the recent convergence of new technologies for electric propulsion and autonomy brings the promise of step-changes in both operating efficiency and sustainability. The next challenge is to define concepts of operations that best use these advanced aircraft. We develop a modeling and optimization environment to address this challenge by first estimating the passenger demand for regional air mobility, and then by concurrently optimizing the fleet assignment and scheduling of these operations. This helps identify the optimum fleet composition and the network of routes that best serve this demand. The contribution of this research is the formulation of the optimization as a half-leg half-itinerary mixed-integer linear program using a hierarchical multi-objective approach that provides insights about trade-offs between profitability and emissions. We demonstrate the ability of this environment to solve large fleet assignment and scheduling problems to near optimality by applying it to the United States Northeast Corridor using a fleet of electric and hybrid-electric regional aircraft. Results highlight that the transition to an electrified fleet allows serving twice the number of communities currently served, while reducing the carbon emissions per passenger by fifty percent. With improving battery specific energy density, many more untapped markets can be served profitably and sustainably, and many smaller communities can get connected to the rest of the National Airspace System. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The widescale consumer adoption of hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (HFCEVs) is currently hindered by the high cost of small-scale hydrogen generation and the lack of extensive hydrogen refueling infrastructure. Natural gas-based hydrogen is cheaper when produced in large volumes but is also associated with high CO2 emissions. To counter these challenges, we propose a hybrid approach where both natural gas and renewables are integrated in a synergistic manner using a dynamic process intensification technology that can be deployed on-site for meeting local demands of refueling stations. The technology is based on sorption enhanced steam methane reforming (SE-SMR) that utilizes a combination of reaction with in-situ CO2 adsorption for enhancing process modularity, productivity and efficiency thereby outperforming conventional SMR at small scale. We develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based optimization framework for simultaneous design and scheduling of the SE-SMR process. The simultaneous optimization provides a synergistic combination whereby the renewables allow sustainable hydrogen manufacturing and the dynamic SE-SMR allows optimal use of the intermittency of the renewables. The U.S. nationwide analysis indicates that for futuristic renewable prices and a hydrogen production capacity of 2 ton/day, hydrogen can be produced at 50% less cost compared to the current cost of small-scale hydrogen generation. The city-wise analysis with varying hydrogen demand shows that even with just 5% HFCEV market penetration level, hydrogen production cost less than $3/kg can be obtained at small scales across the United States with even cheaper hydrogen for large cities. © 2022},

	abstract = {The problem of integrated scheduling of supply chains has a huge impact on operational efficiency and cost effectiveness. Increasing number of the nodes, different time window constraints for customers, and a variety of uncertain scenarios complicate supply chain scheduling. In the study a multi-objective multi-period mixed-integer programming optimization model was developed. We comprehensively considered the effects of demand uncertainty, time window constraints, constraints of node capability, and multi-period and sub-period factors. The conflicting benefit factors, cost and service level are the two optimization objectives. The first objective function aims to minimize the total cost in all periods. The second objective function considers service level by minimizing the material flow of out-of-stock items in all periods to maximize service level. Suppliers' capacity, selection of suppliers, manufacturers' productivity, transaction relationship, sub-period time, inventory capacity and lead time for delivery are also considered. Subsequently the total costs and service levels are normalized, whose sum is the objective function. The problem was transformed into a multi-period non-linear optimization problem. An improved mixed Genetic Algorithm was designed to solve the model. Finally, the practicability of the proposed model and algorithm is demonstrated through its application to an electronics supply chain case study. The results indicate that the proposed model and algorithm can provide a promising approach for fulfilling a multi-objective multi period integrated scheduling plan under uncertain demand scenarios.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Short-term scheduling of oil refinery operations is a complicated optimization problem that requires a high level of detail and needs efficient approaches and software tools. Oil refineries are naturally categorized as continuous process industries due to their production processes, which have essentially different characteristics and constraints from discrete manufacturing processes. It is a significant problem to design effective approaches for oil refinery scheduling optimization. Therefore, this paper aims to provide solutions to the above very challenging problem by proposing a novel methodology. The problem is how to optimize crude oil unloading to charging tanks and charging schedules for different types of crude oils to distillation units (CDUs). Several realistic operational features are considered, such as different arrival times for crude oils, continuous operation of CDUs, no rework of crude oils, and the ability to perform preventative maintenance on CDUs. To solve this problem effectively, a new mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is developed. Industrial case studies are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formulation. The computational results show that the case studies are effectively solved with the proposed solution approach.  © 2022 Abdulrahman Al-Ahmari et al.},

	abstract = {A combined heating and power (CHP) microgrid has high flexibility and economy, but the output of renewable energy is uncertain. Meanwhile, excessive flexible load adjustment in the demand response process will increase user dissatisfaction. In order to solve the above problems, this paper quantifies uncertainty with the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of relative disturbance. Additionally, a multi-objective optimal scheduling model that takes into account both the operating economy and the demand-side power consumption satisfaction is established. In order to solve the multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem well, we propose an improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA), which solves the problem that the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) is prone to low accuracy, insufficient in population diversity and easy to be trapped in local optimum. Combined with the non-dominated solution ranking method, ISSA has the ability of multi-objective optimization. Finally, simulation on a typical CHP microgrid is performed. The optimization results under different confidence levels and risk preference coefficients are compared and analyzed. When the risk preference coefficient is 0.1, 2 and 5, the minimum rotating reserve capacity is 75.17 kW, 82.83 kW, and 105.70 kW in the electric part and 40.08 kW, 59.89 kW, and 61.94 kW in the thermal part.

In particular, Reconfigurable networks, such as distribution systems or microgrids, as smart electricity systems are more controllable and flexible compared to traditional systems. In this study, we integrate network reconfiguration decisions into a multi-period grid operation scheduling problem to minimize the operational costs while taking into account both technical and inter-temporal constraints for distributed energy resources, physical constraints on alternating current (AC) network, and system reliability constraints. We develop a comprehensive optimization model for the grid operation planning problem by taking into account the operation scheduling and economic dispatch decisions from earlier cycles and grid operational constraints while determining the optimal network topology. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, we introduce a two-stage decomposition algorithm where the solution of the operation scheduling problem (without switching variables) feeds the network reconfiguration problem embedding the dispatch problem for each time period. The performance of the proposed two-stage decomposition algorithm is demonstrated on three different available IEEE testbeds against CPLEX and COUENNE solvers for benchmarking purposes. The selected IEEE testbeds have been widely adopted by previous literature for the aforementioned grid operation planning problem due to their capability in reproducibility. The proposed decomposition algorithm outperforms CPLEX in terms of both solution quality and computational times, particularly our algorithm provides 0.5% and 3.17% better solutions in mid-size and large-size networks, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Railway line planning and train timetabling are two key planning steps that determine the operating cost and passenger service quality of a railway operator under the infrastructure capacity limitations. Traditionally, the line planning and train timetabling problems are solved sequentially at the strategic and tactical level, respectively. In this study, by introducing two types of binary decision variables, we first propose a unified integer linear programming (ILP) model for the integrated optimization of line planning and train timetabling. The line planning problem is modeled using ILP to satisfy passenger demand, whereas the cyclic train timetabling problem is formulated as a multi-commodity network flow model with a side track capacity constraint. The two types of binary decision variables are coupled by a cross-resolution consistency constraint, which ensures the conformity of the line planning and train timetabling decisions. Furthermore, a dual decomposition mechanism based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is developed to dualize the cross-resolution consistency and track capacity constraints, such that the original ILP model is decomposed into a line planning sub-problem and a set of train-specific sub-problems. After the linearization of the quadratic penalty terms in the ADMM, each sub-problem contains the Lagrangian relaxation price information based on the cross-resolution consistency constraint. Moreover, the primal and dual solutions are obtained by iteratively and efficiently solving the line planning sub-problem using a commercial solver, and each train-specific sub-problem through a tailored forward dynamic programming algorithm. Furthermore, a real-life case study is conducted based on the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway corridor to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm.

This paper proposes an optimization approach to better manage the operations of a food production line, with the aim of minimizing material waste. The configuration considered is inspired by a real situation. It is a two-stage flow shop with dedicated machines at stage 1 and identical parallel machines at stage 2. A mathematical model is first proposed that considers the minimization of the number of idle times exceeding an acceptable threshold as an objective. A positive time lag for the product and machine setup is considered as a constraint. To solve large problem instances, a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is proposed. In addition, we developed a two-phase procedure based on a decision tree to select the parameters of the HGA. The results show that we could achieve the minimization of material waste without altering too much, another industrial goal, which is the total production time.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Introducing new technologies in co-generation and tri-generation systems has led to a rapid growth toward the energy hubs (EHs) as an effective way for coupling among various energy types. On the other hand, the energy systems have usually been exposed to uncertain environments due to the presence of renewable energy sources (RESs) and interaction with the electricity markets. Hence, this paper develops a novel optimization framework based on a hybrid information gap decision theory (IGDT) and robust optimization (RO) to handle the optimal self-scheduling of the EH within a medium-term horizon for large consumers. The proposed mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework aims to capture the advantages of both the IGDT and RO techniques in dealing with the complicated binary variables and achieving the worst-case realization arisen from wind turbine generation and day-ahead (DA) electricity market uncertainties. The RO optimization approach is presented to model the DA electricity price uncertainty while the uncertainty related to the wind turbine generations is taken into account by the IGDT. Numerical results validate the capability of the model facing uncertainties. The amount of total operation cost of the EH increases by 8.6 % taking into account the worst-case realization of uncertainties through the proposed hybrid IGDT-RO compared to the case considering perfect information. Besides, the results reveal that optimal decisions can be taken by the operator using the proposed hybrid IGDT-RO model. © 2021 The Author(s)},

This integrated problem not only occurs naturally in wave picking systems in which the latest picking time of orders becomes the key performance metric, but also arises when there is a limit on the picker operating time. We present models that result from combining these objectives and analyze their relationship through bounds. We propose a column generation-based exact algorithm for the integrated problem. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the ability of efficiently solving the integrated order batching and picker scheduling problem to optimality by designing a column generation subproblem based on the set of batches, which makes it a challenging optimization problem due to its size. We alleviate this difficulty by reformulating this subproblem, which allows efficient implicit enumeration of its variables. We have also devised a Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm used as a subprocedure within the proposed exact solution algorithm. Finally, we conduct experiments on randomly generated instances and show that the proposed algorithms are capable of solving instances with up to 100 orders. © Copyright © 2021 “IISE”.},

To achieve flexible EH in the presence of renewable energy sources (RESs) and combined heat and power (CHP) system, energy storage systems (ESS) and incentive-based demand response program (IDRP) are used. The proposed problem minimizes the total expected costs of operation, reliability, and flexibility of the energy networks including EHs. The optimization scheme is constrained to the optimal power flow (OPF) equations and the reliability requirements of these networks and the EH model in the presence of sources and active loads, namely ESS and IDRP. Scenario-based stochastic programming (SBSP) is utilized to model uncertainties of load, energy cost, power generation of RES, and network equipment availability. The problem has a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) nature. Consequently, a hybrid teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) and crow search algorithm (CSA) is used to obtain a reliable optimal solution with a low standard deviation. Finally, by simulating the proposed scheme on a sample test system, the capabilities of this scheme in improving the reliability, operation, and flexibility of energy networks in accordance with the optimal scheduling for EHs are confirmed. © 2021},

A scheduling model based on chance-constrained programming is proposed for integrated demand response (IDR) enabled CIES in uncertain environments to minimize the system operating costs, where an IDR program is used to explore the potential interaction ability of electricity-gas-heat flexible loads and electric vehicles. Moreover, power to gas (P2G) and microgas turbine (MT), as the links of multienergy carriers, are adopted to strengthen the coupling of different energy subsystems. Sequence operation theory and linearization methods are employed to transform the original model into a solvable mixed-integer linear programming model. The simulation results on a practical CIES in North China demonstrate an improvement in the CIES operational economy via the coordination of IDR and renewable uncertainties, with P2G and MT enhancing the system operational flexibility and user comprehensive satisfaction. The CIES operation is able to achieve a tradeoff between the economy and system reliability by setting a suitable confidence level for the spinning reserve constraints. Besides, the proposed solution method outperforms the hybrid intelligent algorithm in terms of both optimization results and calculation efficiency. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Electric buses can bring significant environmental and social benefits in the future public transportation systems. However, the large-scale adoption of electric buses faces major technical challenges caused by not only the limited running range and long charging time, but also the complex power grid characteristics, such as time-of-use (TOU) electricity tariffs and peak load risk. On one hand, the operation cost is determined by the TOU pricing and vehicle schedule. On the other hand, the unbalanced charging demand resulting from the vehicle schedule will cause peak load risk and pose a potential threat to the power grid safety. With the increasing penetration of electric buses, there is a real need to carefully design and manage electric bus scheduling to not only reduce the system costs but also ensure power grid safety. In this paper, we introduce a bi-objective multi-depot electric vehicle scheduling problem, a new generalization to the vehicle scheduling problem where the effects of TOU pricing and peak load risk are explicitly considered. The dual objectives are to minimize the total operation cost and to minimize the peak load resulting from concurrent recharging activities, as constrained by the running range of the electric buses and the capacity of charging depots/stations. A time-expanded network model is devised to represent this problem, while the bi-objective optimization model is reformulated by the lexicographic method. We propose a tailored branch-and-price method to solve the problem. Heuristics and a trip chain pool strategy are embedded into the branch-and-price method to expedite the computation time. Our method is validated through a benchmark network and a real-world bus network in Guangzhou, China. The results demonstrate that our method is effective in cost savings and peak load leveling, and far outperforms the off-the-shelf solver with respect to solution quality and computation efficiency. The real-world application results show that compared to state-of-the-practice, the peak load can be significantly reduced, on top of cost and fleet size savings. © 2021},

	abstract = {When managing a constellation of nanosatellites, one may leverage this structure to improve the mission’s quality-of-service (QoS) by optimally distributing the tasks during an orbit. In this sense, this research proposes an offline energy-aware task scheduling problem formulation regarding the specifics of constellations, by considering whether the tasks are individual, collective, or stimulated to be redundant. By providing such an optimization framework, the idea of estimating an offline task schedule can serve as a baseline for the constellation design phase. For example, given a particular orbit, from the simulation of an irradiance model, the engineer can estimate how the mission value is affected by the inclusion or exclusion of individuals objects. The proposed model, given in the form of a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model, is illustrated in this work for several illustrative scenarios considering different sets of tasks and constellations. We also perform an analysis of the Pareto-optimal frontier of the problem, identifying the feasible trade-off points between constellation and individual tasks. This information can be useful to the decision-maker (mission operator) when planning the behavior in orbit. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new framework for the scheduling of microgrids and distribution feeder reconfiguration (DFR), taking into consideration the uncertainties due to the load demand, market price, and renewable power generation. The model is implemented on the modified IEEE 118-bus test system, including microgrids and smart homes. The problem has been formulated as a two-stage model, which at the first stage, the day-ahead self-scheduling of each microgrid is carried out as a two-objective optimization problem. The two objectives include the minimization of the total operating cost and maximization of the consumer's comfort index. Then, the solution, obtained from the first stage is delivered to the distribution system operator (DSO). Then, at the second stage, the DSO determines the optimal configuration of the system with the aim of minimizing operating costs of the main grid and the penalty of deviating from microgrid scheduling. Note that the penalty is due to the difference in power exchange requested by the microgrids from the power exchange finalized by the DSO. The presented two-stage optimization problem is modeled in a mixed-integer linear programing (MILP) framework with four case studies, and solved in GAMS by using the GURUBI solver. The simulation results show that in the cases the DSO is able to reconfigure the system, the deviation from the optimal scheduling of microgrids would be considerably lower than the cases with fixed system configuration. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

We assume a baseline personnel task schedule that is subject to different types of disruptions, occurring on a daily basis. This operational uncertainty is the result of three sources of variability, i.e. uncertainty of demand, uncertainty of capacity and uncertainty of arrival, which may render the baseline schedule infeasible. Therefore, the rescheduling of the originally constructed personnel schedule is necessary to compose an operational schedule. We propose a dedicated branch-and-price procedure to recover the personnel task schedule, which considers a wide range of recovery mechanisms to reassign the tasks to workers, allowing the retiming of tasks, to restore the feasibility. Different computational experiments are conducted to show the performance of the proposed branch-and-price thriving on different speed-up techniques and optimisation principles. We benchmark the proposed algorithm with other optimisation procedures and show the contribution of the algorithm design choices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In the rapidly changing multimodal transportation market, not only the obligation in providing train services but also the responsibility in helping other transportation modes to meet emergencies are instrumental for maximizing the generalized benefit of railway companies, leading to an increased utilization. This paper proposes an optimization framework, which includes multiple dispatching measures of arranging residual seats, modifying stopping plans, and inserting additional trains, to design a rescheduling operation plan on a high-speed rail corridor to meet the passenger demand of unexpected large passenger flow (ULPF), which is generated from the disruption of other transportation modes. Considering the revenues of shifting passengers and the costs of the three dispatching measures as two objectives, we formulate a linear integer programming (LIP) model by employing a time-space network to obtain an optimization rescheduling operation plan. Several experiments based on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway corridor are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can be used to obtain a reasonable rescheduling operation plan for serving the passengers from ULPF within an acceptable calculation timeframe.  © 2022 Junduo Zhao et al.},

	abstract = {Modern industrial robots are increasingly deployed in dynamic environments, where unpredictable events are expected to impact the robot’s operation. Under these conditions, runtime task replanning is required to avoid failures and unnecessary stops, while keeping up productivity. Task replanning is a long-sighted complement to path replanning, which is mostly concerned with avoiding unexpected obstacles that can lead to potentially unsafe situations. This paper focuses on task replanning as a way to dynamically adjust the robot behaviour to the continuously evolving environment in which it is deployed. Analogously to probabilistic roadmaps used in path planning, we propose the concept of Task roadmaps as a method to replan tasks by leveraging an offline generated search space. A graph-based model of the robot application is converted to a task scheduling problem to be solved by a proposed Branch and Bound (B&B) approach and two benchmark approaches: Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). The B&B approach is proposed to compute the task roadmap, which is then reused to replan for unforeseeable events. The optimality and efficiency of this replanning approach are demonstrated in a simulation-based experiment with a mobile manipulator in a kitting application. In this study, the proposed B&B Task Roadmap replanning approach is significantly faster than a MILP solver and a PDDL based planner. Copyright © 2022 Lager, Spampinato, Papadopoulos and Nolte.},

	abstract = {The high reliability and flexibility of Battery Energy Storage (BES) resources in comparison with other renewable technologies promote the development of this technology in smart grids. The fast response of BES to load variations could help the power system operators to maintain the balance of generation and consumption in real-time, and improve the flexibility of the smart grid, effectively. In this work, a new model is presented that determines the aggregated scheduling of BES and Wind Power Resource (WPR) in the joint energy and reserve markets. To evaluate the performance of BES in different markets, the proposed model is divided into day-ahead and real-time planning horizons. According to market prices, ramp rates, marginal costs, and technical constraints of units, the optimal participation levels in different markets are determined. The deployed power in real-time and wind power are considered as the uncertain parameters and the Robust Optimization (RO) framework is proposed to manage the related financial risk based on the worst-case realizations of uncertain parameters. The robust strategy is formulated based on the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) technique, which can be solved via the branch-and-bound method. Finally, the performance and effectiveness of the model are analyzed via different case studies. Simulation results show that the day-ahead and real-time markets are the best options for buying and selling the energy of BESs, and participation in the reserve market and regulation service increases their profit, significantly. Furthermore, the expected profit greatly depends on the risk preferences of decision-makers, and reducing the variation interval of wind generation by 40 % leads to an increase of 74.65 % in revenues. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Researchers have studied the nurse rostering problem for multiple decades. Initially, the formulations were rather primitive including only a few necessary restrictions, but down the road, the formulations have become more complex. Nonetheless, a fraction of the research reaches implementation in practice, and many wards still schedule nurses manually. In this article, we introduce a flexible nurse rostering system that employs mathematical optimization to automatically schedule nurses to shifts. We have developed this system in collaboration with practitioners to fully match their needs. The system consists of a comprehensive mixed integer programming (MIP) model along with a flexible framework. In addition to common constraints from the literature, the mathematical formulation includes three new constraints that further encourage healthy work schedules for each nurse. Additionally, we have reformulated some common constraints from the literature and allow for a complex shift structure that matches the needs of real hospital wards. This flexibility results in increased adaptability for different wards with different needs and is crucial to address the complex nurse rostering problem that practitioners face. We have successfully implemented this system in two wards at two Danish hospitals. We present the MIP model along with computational results for 12 real-world rostering instances. Furthermore, we discuss the practical impact of this system and provide general feedback from the practitioners using it. Overall, the results illustrate the capabilities of the system to tackle diverse nurse rostering instances and produce outstanding results. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The scheduling of (parallel) serial-batch processing machines is a task arising in many industrial sectors. In the metal-processing industry for instance, cutting operations are necessary to fabricate varying metal pieces out of large base slides. Here, the (cutting) jobs have individual, arbitrary base slide capacity requirements (sizes), individual processing times and due dates, and specific material requirements (i.e. each job belongs to one specific job family, whereby jobs of different families cannot be processed within the same batch and thus are incompatible). In addition, switching of base metal slides and material dependent adjustments of machine parameters cause sequence-dependent setup times. All these conditions need to be considered while minimising total weighted tardiness. For solving the scheduling problem, a mixed-integer program and several tailor-made construction heuristics (enhanced by local search mechanisms) are presented. The experimental results show that problem instances with up to five machines and 60 jobs can be tackled using the optimisation model. The experiments on small and large problem instances (with up to 400 jobs) show that a purposefully used batch capacity limitation improves the solution quality remarkably. Applying the best heuristic to the data of two real-world application cases shows its huge potential to increase delivery reliability. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

After that, a dual-population artificial bee colony algorithm (DPABC) and a heuristic task scheduling algorithm are proposed. Two learning-based nectar generation methods are used to guide the direction of population optimization. The search population is used to lead the nectar search at the stage of employed bees and supplement population is used to improve search performance. According to the performance of these two populations, candidate populations are generated to realize the search of onlooker bees. After each generation of population search, the composition of the two populations is adjusted according to the performance.

	abstract = {This study proposes an optimization scheme of thermal power and electric power dispatch integrated with load scheduling for the domestic fuel cell-based combined heat and power (DFCCHP) system. The scheme is implemented in home energy management systems installed in smart homes. To provide accurate energy cost evaluation for the optimization scheme, the nonlinear electric efficiency characteristics of the fuel cell are approximated with a polynomial expression. Along with the inclusion of thermal power dispatch in the scheme, the nonlinear relationship between the thermal power and the electric power of the fuel cell is incorporated to design temperature constraints in the DFCCHP system. On top of the nonlinearity and complexity of the fuel cell, residential electric load scheduling and other energy sources including the power grid, PV panels, and battery energy storage are considered to ensure that the scheme takes a comprehensive energy management approach. Because of the nonlinearity that exists in the modeling of the DFCCHP system, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming formulation is utilized to solve the optimization problem. The scheme is tested in a day-ahead environment with time-varying electricity prices and natural gas prices. The optimization aims to minimize the electricity cost and natural gas cost. It is shown in the simulation that optimization scheme dispatches the electric power and thermal power in an optimal way so that the energy cost due to time-varying electricity prices and natural gas prices is minimized. The electricity cost optimization puts both power purchase and power selling into consideration. It is also shown in the simulation that the household loads are scheduled in an optimal way to the time slots with lower electricity prices in accordance with the optimal thermal and electric power dispatch.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We consider the optimization of the cross-docking operations at three INtermodal LOgistics Platforms (INLOPs) of a large European car manufacturer (ECM). The planning horizon is a week and the time bucket is a day. An inbound flow of products is gradually received over the week by truck from inland suppliers, and has to be loaded into containers which are then shipped to offshore production plants. The full content of a container must be available at the INLOP to enable its loading operations to start, hence temporary storage is needed. The objective is to minimize an inventory penalty, computed as the largest daily volume of temporary product storage observed over the planning horizon. The current practice at ECM is to first optimize the content of the inbound trucks and of the outbound containers independently, and then determine the loading day of each container to be shipped based on these fixed contents. We propose to integrate, within the same optimization framework, the decisions on both truck and container contents, which involve complex loading constraints related to the dimensions and weights of the products, with those on the scheduling of container loading. We model the resulting problem as a mixed integer linear program, and we develop a decomposition scheme for it, as well as a fix-and-optimize matheuristic. We perform extensive computational experiments on real instances provided by ECM. Results show that a combination of these two matheuristics is able to generate solutions that reduce the average inventory penalty by 40%. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

The mathematical model is created without simplifications, using the real calendar, including holidays. This precludes the possibility of cyclic-type solutions, and involves numerous and varied constraints (demand, workload, ergonomics, fairness, etc.). An effective solution to this very difficult practical problem cannot be obtained, for large instances, with exact solution methods. We formulate a mathematical representation of a real-world ER physician scheduling problem featuring a hybrid algorithm combining continuous linear programming with a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP). Linear programming is used to model a general physician-demand covering problem, where the solution is used to guide the construction phase of the GRASP, to obtain initial full schedules for subsequent improvement by iterative application of Variable Neighborhood Descent Search (VNDS) and Network Flow Optimization (NFO). A computational study shows the superiority of our approach over the Integer Linear Programming method in a set of instances of varying size and difficulty inspired by a real setting. The methodology is embedded in a software tool for generating one-year-ahead physician schedules for a local ER. These solutions, which are now in use, outperform the manually-created schedules used previously. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

The resulting trajectory optimization problem is a mixed integer non-linear problem (MINLP) which is challenging solve. Specifically, there are coupling constraints which cannot be solved directly. We exploit a penalty decomposition method to reformulate the optimization formulation into a new form and use block coordinate descent technique to decompose the problem into sub-problems.

	abstract = {In modern systems, there is a tendency to model issues more accurately with low computational cost and considering multiscale decision-making which increases the complexity of the optimization. Therefore, it is necessary to develop tools to cope with these new challenges. Supply chain management of enterprise-wide operations usually involves three decision levels: strategic, tactical, and operational. These decision levels depend on each other involving different time scales. Accordingly, their integration usually leads to multiscale models that are computationally intractable. In this work, the aim is to develop novel clustering methods with multiple attributes to tackle the integrated problem. As a result, a clustering structure is proposed in the form of a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) later converted into a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for clustering shape-based time series data with multiple attributes through a multi-objective optimization approach (since different attributes have different scales or units) and minimize the computational complexity of multiscale decision problems. The results show that normal clustering is closer to the optimal case (full-scale model) compared with sequence clustering. Additionally, it provides improved solution quality due to flexibility in terms of sequence restrictions. The developed clustering algorithms can work with any two-dimensional datasets and simultaneous demand patterns. The most suitable applications of the clustering algorithms are long-term planning and integrated scheduling and planning problems. To show the performance of the proposed method, it is investigated on an energy hub as a case study, the results show a significant reduction in computational cost with accuracies ranging from 95.8% to 98.3%. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {With recent developments, smart grids assured for residential customers the opportunity to schedule smart home appliances’ operation times to simultaneously reduce both the electricity bill and the PAR based on demand response, as well as increasing user comfort. It is clear that the multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem involves constraints and the consumer’s preferences, and the solution to the problem is a difficult task. There have been a limited number of investigations carried out so far to solve the indicated problems using metaheuristic techniques like particle swarm optimization, mixed-integer linear programming, and the grey wolf and crow search optimization algorithms, etc. Due to the on/off control of smart home appliances, binary-coded genetic algorithms seem to be a well-fitted approach to obtain an optimal solution. It can be said that the novelty of this work is to represent the on/off state of the smart home appliance with a binary string which undergoes crossover and mutation operations during the genetic process. Because special binary numbers represent interruptible and uninterruptible smart home appliances, new types of crossover and mutation were developed to find the most convenient solutions to the problem. Although there are a few works which were carried out using the genetic algorithms, the proposed approach is rather distinct from those employed in their work. The designed genetic software runs at least ten times, and the most fitting result is taken as the optimal solution to the indicated problem; in order to ensure the optimal result, the fitness against the generation is plotted in each run, whether it is converged or not. The simulation results are significantly encouraging and meaningful to residential customers and utilities for the achievement of the goal, and they are feasible for a wide-range applications of home energy management systems. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) cells has improved significantly in the last decade, making PV generation a common feature of the sustainable microgrid. As the PV-powered microgrid reaches high penetrations of intermittent PV power, optimum scheduling of over-production is necessary to minimize energy curtailment. Failure to include an accurate assessment of curtailed energy costs in the scheduling process increases wasted energy. Moreover, applying an objective function without considering the cost coefficients results in an inefficient concentration of curtailed power in a specific time interval. In this study, we provide an optimization method for scheduling the microgrid assets to evenly distribute curtailment over the entire daily period of PV generation. Each of the curtailment intervals established in our optimization model features the application of different cost coefficients. In the final step, curtailment costs are added to the objective function. The proposed cost minimization algorithm preferentially selects intervals with low curtailment costs to prevent the curtailment from being concentrated at a specific time. By inducing even distribution of curtailment, this novel optimization methodology has the potential to improve the cost-effectiveness of the PV-powered microgrid. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Building a more sustainable society is an urgent requirement for today's service-oriented manufacturing enterprises, such as automobile maintenance firms. In automobile maintenance service, traditional painting process scheduling scheme usually only considers the profits of enterprises, ignoring the requirements of customers or other stakeholders. To address this gap and achieve sustainable operations of enterprises in the long term, this paper concentrated on the vehicle scheduling of painting process problem with the concern of the demands of managers, workers, customers, governments and non-government environmental protection organisations. This problem was formulated as a nonlinear 0–1 integer programming model to minimise makespan (MP), total pollutant emissions (TPE) and total customers' perceived dissatisfaction (TCPDS). A genetic algorithm was designed to solve the model, and a practical case using data from both the information system and the survey was performed to test the performance of the proposed model and algorithm. Computational results revealed that the genetic algorithm performed well in terms of validity and stability. Pareto solutions demonstrated that optimising task sequences helped increase customers' perceived satisfaction while improving the makespan of vehicle painting, decreased paint waste, and reduced worker health and safety risks. Some of the increases in the percentage of well-timed customer service reservations were catalysed by the method that combined tiered pricing, related to delivery times, the automobile painting efficiency, which improved customers' perceived satisfaction. This paper also further guides managers to incorporate sustainable development into operations in service-oriented manufacturing enterprises. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {This paper deals with a Flexible Flow Shop (FFS) scheduling problem with unrelated parallel machines and a renewable resource shared among the stages. The FFS scheduling problem is one of the most common manufacturing environments, in which there is more than a machine in at least one production stage. In such a system, to decrease the processing times, additional renewable resources are assigned to the jobs or machines, which can lead to a decrease in the total completion time. For this purpose, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is proposed to minimize the maximum completion time (makespan) in an FFS environment. The proposed model is computationally intractable. Therefore, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, as well as a hybrid PSO and Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm named SA-PSO, are developed to solve the model. Through numerical experiments on randomly generated test problems, the authors demonstrate that the hybrid SA-PSO algorithm outperforms the PSO, especially for large size test problems.  © 2021 Sharif University of Technology.

	abstract = {In high-frequency bus services, maintaining the service regularity is a critical issue. The service regularity is directly related to the excessive waiting times (EWT) of passengers at bus stops. In a regular service, the EWT is minimized resulting in even headways between consecutive buses of the same line. In this study, we propose the combined use of rescheduling and bus holding to improve passengers' excessive waiting times. We model the dynamic rescheduling and bus holding problem as an integer nonlinear program (INLP) and we prove its NP-hardness. Our model considers the constraints of the original timetable – an issue that is usually neglected from most dynamic control methods. Given the NP-hardness of our mathematical program, we introduce a problem-specific heuristic to explore efficiently the solution space. The convergence rate of the proposed heuristic is tested against other solution methods, including simulated annealing with linear cooling, hill climbing and branch and bound with multi-start sequential quadratic programming. In addition, simulations with the use of actual operational data from a major bus operator in Asia Pacific demonstrate an up to 35% potential EWT improvement for a minor increase of 6% to the travel times of onboard passengers. © 2021 The Author},

	abstract = {Previous studies on liner container shipping operations usually assume identical container ships deployed in the same shipping route. However, in real operations, this assumption does not always hold considering the distinct capacities, ages, fuel efficiencies, cost structures, etc. of these ships. These distinctions significantly influence the number of containers transported, the bunker fuel consumption, and the operating cost of a shipping route. In this regard, this paper considers the joint ship deployment, sequencing, and scheduling problem for a fleet of heterogeneous vessels in a shipping route. A mixed integer programming model is developed to select the optimal ships from a set of candidate ships together with their sequences, schedules, and sailing speeds in the shipping route to minimize the total cost. A tailored solution algorithm is subsequently developed to calculate the global optimal solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate that this algorithm significantly outperforms the classical branch-and-cut algorithm in solving the model. In addition, by applying our model in a real-case shipping route, we find that the model is able to reduce the total cost by 5% compared with that considering homogeneous vessels. Finally, several managerial insights are obtained to guide the operations of a liner shipping route. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Dynamic tariffs are expected to be implemented as commercial offers of electricity retailers in smart grids, conveying price signals aimed at shaping usage patterns, with potential benefits to enhance grid efficiency and reduce end-users’ costs. Retailers and consumers have divergent goals. While the objective of the retailer is to maximize profits, the purpose of consumers is to minimize their electricity bill. The interaction between the retailer and consumers can be modeled by means of bi-level (BL) programming: the retailer sets the prices to be charged to consumers and these react by scheduling flexible appliances according to those prices and their comfort requirements. In this work, two hybrid BL optimization approaches are proposed to solve this problem, considering one leader (retailer) and multiple followers (consumers). Two population-based approaches were developed, a genetic algorithm (GA) and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, to deal with the upper level problem, both encompassing an exact mixed-integer linear programming solver to address the lower level optimization problem. Different scenarios were generated, comprising one leader (retailer imposing different price schemes) and three followers (with different consumer profiles). Typical residential appliances were considered, with different operation cycles. Also, diverse tariff structures set by the retailer were analyzed. The performance of the two algorithms was compared. Results revealed a consistent superiority of PSO over GA. © 2019 The Authors. International Transactions in Operational Research © 2019 International Federation of Operational Research Societies},

	abstract = {Recent studies have indicated a great potential for applying predictive methodologies to the operation of Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Particularly for Centralized Chiller Plants with Thermal Energy Storage (TES) used for District Cooling, there is a substantial opportunity for cost savings when responding to variations in electricity price and ambient temperature. The present work addresses the problem of closed-loop scheduling of a large-scale chiller plant with TES tank under a Day-Ahead (DA) electricity price program. The main contributions include: (i) formulating the problem for a real large-scale complex system; (ii) comparing different dispatching policies with varying degrees of optimality, constraint satisfaction and operational complexity; and (iii) designing an optimization-based scheduling tool and describing its implementation and results. The proposed Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation extends existing models by explicitly accounting for the effect of chilled water return temperature on the energy balances, considering real plant features, and performing pre-calculation of bounds on equipment and storage capacity. The study is performed with real process data from the central chiller plant located on the campus of the University of California, Davis. The comparison between different dispatching policies highlights the benefits of adopting an optimization-based operational strategy, indicating a cost reduction of up to 32% compared to other suboptimal policies. The study also demonstrates how additional constraints that reduce operational complexity affect the closed-loop performance of the optimization-based method, serving as a guideline for designing the optimization tool. © 2021 The Authors},

We formulate a set partitioning model for this problem, subject to predefined trip schedule and limited charging facilities. A tailored branch-and-price approach is then proposed to find the global optimal solution. In particular, we develop an effective multi-label correcting method to deal with the pricing problem (i.e., generating columns) in column generation procedure within the branch-and-price framework, coupled with a dual stabilization technique with an aim to accelerate the convergence rate. Meanwhile, a branch-and-bound solution approach is adopted to guarantee optimal integer solutions. Numerical experiments and a case study arising from real transit network are conducted to further assess the efficiency and applicability of the proposed method. Our experiments confirm that, despite the complexity of the considered problem, optimal solution can still be generated within reasonable computational time using the proposed algorithm. The results also show considerable cost saving (about 10.1–27.3% less) if this optimization model is implemented, mainly contributed by the substantial extension of battery life.

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to propose mathematical models to represent a lot sizing and scheduling problem on multiple production lines that share scarce resources and to investigate the computational performance of the proposed models. The main feature that differentiates this problem from others in the literature is that the decision on which lines to organize should be taken considering the availability of the necessary resources. The optimization criterion is the minimization of the costs incurred in the production process (inventory, backlogging, organization of production lines, and sequence-dependent setup costs). Nine mixed integer optimization models to represent the problem are given and, also, the results of an extensive computational study carried out using a set of instances from the literature. The computational study indicates that an efficient formulation, able to provide high quality solutions for large sized instances, can be obtained from a classical model by making the binary production variables explicit, using the facility location reformulation as well as the single commodity flow constraints to eliminate subsequences. Moreover, from the results, it is also clear that the consideration of scarce resources makes the problem significantly more difficult than the traditional one.  © The authors.

The problem was proven NP-hard even for budgeted uncertainty. In the present work we design mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations that are valid for a variety of uncertainty sets encompassing budgeted uncertainty. A new dominance among solutions is proposed, resulting into an MIP formulation. We further study the combinatorial structure of the problem. Non-trivial polynomial cases under budgeted uncertainty are exhibited, where the dominance-based formulation yields a polyhedral characterization of integer solutions. In more general cases, the dominance-based formulation is shown to be tighter than all previously known formulations. In numerical experiments we investigate how the formulation performs on instances around the polynomial cases, for both budgeted uncertainty sets and more elaborate uncertainty sets involving several budgets. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In railway networks, unexpected disruptions happen for numerous reasons, which in-turn induce delays and cancellations that eventually bring about passenger inconvenience. Thus, the Trains Timetable Rescheduling (TTR) is required, but “how to reschedule the railway timetable” is an imperative issue in real train operations. Though the existing research works concentrated on rescheduling the timetable, the delay time along with reliability, still, are not greatly solved. Thus, this paper proposed a multi-objective and dictionary-based checking for effective rescheduling trains. In this proposed system, first, the constraints are extracted, and the MCMIGP metrics are illustrated. Next, the GKACO optimizes the constraints to make optimal rescheduling. In this algorithm, the multi-objective function is viewed as the fitness function, which is the amalgamation of minimization of a train delay, dwell time, timetable deviation, along with the operational cost and augmentation of service reliability. Subsequent to the generation of rescheduling, the rescheduled timetable's feasibility is checked based on the dictionary-based checking technique. If the rescheduled timetable is feasible, then it is denoted as the optimal timetable. Otherwise, the timetable is again rescheduled by using the same GKACO. Lastly, the experimentation's analysis proves the proposed TTR system's performance. © 2021 THE AUTHORS},

	abstract = {At Université de Technologie de Compiègne (UTC), complete course timetables are made available to students for the forthcoming semester, then students select their courses. A student cannot attend two events at the same time without violating a hard conflict constraint. Ideally, a conflict-free individual timetable will be created for each student, but it may be the case that there is no feasible solution for all students simultaneously. With thousands of students and hundreds of courses, UTC's Student Scheduling Problem (SSP) cannot be processed manually. A heuristic designed decades ago can no longer be used, because too many students are left non-assigned and because the heuristic was not designed to deal with the current requirements. In this study we propose a preprocessing that reduces the size of instances, together with lower bounds that allow the quality of computed solutions to be assessed. Where most of the graphs relating to students’ hard conflict constraints are interval graphs, we show that a clique formulation of the hard conflict constraints may substantially reduce the number of equations in relation to other formulations. We propose integer linear programming (ILP) formulations to address the current requirements. We test an ILP with a global objective function and other ILPs within a lexicographic scheme. We investigate valid inequalities for reducing computation times. We report our computational experiments and results obtained on real instances from UTC. The solution method has proved its effectiveness and is now the tool used for student scheduling at UTC. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

This flexible structure not only could potentially possess the strength to recover quickly, but also ensures the supply of vital loads and preserves functionalities under any contingency. To achieve these targets, this article examines a novel spatiotemporal algorithm to split the existing network into a set of self-healing μGs. In this endeavor, after designing the μGs by determining a mix of heterogeneous generation resources and allocating remotely controlled switches, the μGs operational scheduling is decomposed into interconnected and islanded modes. The main intention in the grid-tied state is to maximize the μGs profit while equilibrating load and generation at the islanded state by sectionalizing on-fault area, executing resources rescheduling, network reconfiguration and load shedding when the main grid is interrupted. The proposed problem is formulated as an exact computationally efficient mixed integer linear programming problem relying on the column and constraint generation framework and an adjustable interval optimization is envisaged to make the μGs less susceptible against renewables variability. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is adequately assured by performing a realistic case study.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

In this regard, the deployment of complementary technologies is of paramount importance for the energy transformation of the Polish heating sector. This work addresses the challenge of sizing large-scale thermal energy storage (TES) systems for combined heat and power (CHP) plants connected to district heating networks and participating in day-ahead electricity markets. In this paper, a method based on a mixed-integer linear programming approach is proposed to find the optimal capacity of TES units connected to coal-fired CHP systems. The model considers the specific investment costs of the storage technology and optimizes the annual operation scheduling of the CHP-TES system. The model is applied to the case study of a coal-fired CHP system. Four scenarios are used to investigate the performance of the CHP system and evaluate the effects of rising carbon prices on the optimal capacity of the TES unit. The results reveal that the integration of the TES leads to a significant drop in the utilization of the heat-only boilers, helping mitigate fuel and environmental costs. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Among the potential road maps to sustainable production, efficient manufacturing scheduling is a promising direction. This paper addresses the lack of knowledge in the scheduling theory by introducing a generalized flexible flow shop model with unrelated parallel machines in each stage. A mixed-integer programming formulation is proposed for such model, solved by a two-phase genetic algorithm (GA), tackling job sequencing and machine allocation in each phase. The algorithm is parallelized with a specialized island model, where the evaluated chromosomes of all generations are preserved to provide the final Pareto-Optimal solutions. The feasibility of our method is demonstrated with a small example from literature, followed with the investigation of the premature convergence issue. Afterwards, the algorithm is applied to a real-sized instance from a Belgium pasta manufacturer. We illustrate how the algorithm converges over iterations to trade-off near-optimal solutions (with 8.50% shorter makespan, 5.24% cheaper energy cost and 6.02% lower labor cost), and how the evaluated candidates distribute in the objective space. A comparison with a NSGA-II implementation is further performed using hypothesis testing, having 5.43%, 0.95% and 2.07% improvement in three sub-objectives mentioned above. Although this paper focuses on scheduling issues, the proposed GA can serve as an efficient method for other multi-objective optimization problems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, fog computing has emerged as an extension to the cloud computing that relies on fog nodes with distributed resources at the edge of network. Fog nodes offer computing and storage resources opportunities to resource-less IoT devices which are not capable to support IoT applications with computation-intensive requirements. Furthermore, the closeness of fog nodes to IoT devices satisfies the low-latency requirements of IoT applications. However, due to the high IoT task offloading requests and fog resource limitations, providing an optimal task scheduling solution that considers a number of quality metrics is essential. In this paper, we address the task scheduling problem with the aim of optimizing the time and energy consumption as two QoS parameters in the fog context. First, we present a fog-based architecture for handling the task scheduling requests to provide the optimal solutions. Second, we formulate the task scheduling problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) optimization model considering both time and fog energy consumption. Finally, we propose an advanced approach called Opposition-based Chaotic Whale Optimization Algorithm (OppoCWOA) to enhance the performance of the original WOA for solving the modelled task scheduling problem in a timely manner. The efficiency of the proposed OppoCWOA is shown by providing extensive simulations and comparisons with the original WOA and some existing meta-heuristic algorithms such as Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Genetic Algorithm (GA). © 2021, The Author(s).},

We assume that the modulation and coding schemes (MCSs) that are used by the (broadcasting) nodes as well as the transmission power of the nodes are adjustable. This leads to the main research question studied in this paper: to what extent traffic throughput can be increased by proper MCSs assignment and transmission power control (TPC) at the nodes? To answer this question, we introduce mixed-integer programming formulations for joint MCSs assignment and TPC optimization, together with a solution algorithm. Finally, we present a numerical study illustrating the considerations of the paper. The numerical results show a significant gain being achieved by proper MCSs assignment, which is further increased by applying TPC. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Air traffic congestions for processing relief cargos under post-disaster relief scenarios are common, due to high transport demands within a short time. To enhance the resilience of relief operations at airport, an optimization problem of relief air cargo transportations involving aircraft sequencing and loading/unloading within a designated hangar is studied in this paper. The objective is minimizing the tardiness in fulfilling inbound and outbound relief cargos. A mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated, which incorporates aircraft sequencing and hangar parking planning. To resolve the practical problem efficiently, we propose a two-stage optimization approach, which reduces complexity in solving the original model by coordinating the decisions of aircraft landing and take-off schedule and cargo hangar parking arrangement through iterations. The efficiency of the proposed method is examined through the computational results. High-quality solutions can be obtained by the two-stage optimization method within a reasonable time for practical implementation, which enhances the responsiveness and resource utilization of airport operations management under disaster relief situations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The low energy density of batteries and the long recharging times constitute a significant barrier for electrification of public transportation (PT) systems since electric buses (EB) require too heavy and expensive batteries to achieve the operational availability of their combustion engine counterparts. New recharging technologies such as fast chargers and dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) emerge as promising solutions to overcome these challenges. Optimizing the bus fleet composition and the schedules is essential to take advantage of these emerging technologies and achieve electrification of PT in a cost-efficient way. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an integer (binary) programming formulation to find the optimal electric bus fleet composition and scheduling that minimizes the total procurement cost of the buses and the operating cost of the schedules. A column generation (CG) approach is devised to obtain provably high-quality solutions, for large problem instances. The success of the approach is due to a novel dynamic programming algorithm we develop to solve the generalized resource-constrained shortest path problem that needs to be solved in each CG iteration to find out new schedules to include in the model. Extensive computational studies on large real-world PT networks attest to the efficacy of the suggested methodology and reveal valuable managerial insights from a system-wide perspective. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper studies both the design and the cyclic scheduling of multi-hoist treatment surface facilities. Former research have always assumed that the design of the production line is already available with a fixed material handling fleet size. However, in this study, the number of hoists is considered as a decision variable of the problem. The latter is then bi-objective and called the Cyclic Hoist Design and Scheduling Problem (CHDSP). The optimization objective is to determine an optimal cyclic schedule for each possible number of hoists that minimizes the cycle time and thus maximizes the line throughput rate. The achieved results will contribute to building a decision support system that will enable to choose the required number of transportation resources for the production line regarding both aims of productivity maximization and cost savings. An original encoding approach is proposed that both assigns a number of hoists to the line and generates their move sequences, which are evaluated thanks to a mixed integer linear programming model. A rich and well-structured solving algorithm based on variable neighborhood search is developed and adapted to solve efficiently the whole problem. It is also improved by a backtrack procedure that further enhances the findings. Computational experiments are conducted on benchmark problems and demonstrate the high performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm that was, in most cases, even able to reach the optimal solutions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The overall problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model while a two-phase hierarchical solution strategy is developed to solve the resulting optimization problem efficiently. The first phase relies on truck scheduling decisions being relaxed, whereas the second phase solves the original model at reduced space by fixing product allocation as determined by phase one.

The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are utilized to convert the bi-level nonlinear problem into a single level mixed-integer linear problem (MILP). A combined heat and power (CHP) unit and wind turbines (WT) are integrated into MES as the production units, while various storage technologies, such as hydrogen energy storage (HES), natural gas storage (GS) and thermal energy storage (TES), as well as demand response program (DRP), are integrated to increase the flexibility of the system. A hybrid robust optimization (RO) and stochastic programming (SP) method is deployed to deal with uncertainties of MES.

In this paper, a mathematical model for the daily staff routing and service scheduling is developed for home health care companies. In this model, both economic factors and qualitative service-oriented performance measures are simultaneously optimized. To make the model more realistic, many real situations such as considering different qualifications and diverse vehicles for staff members, different requirements and predetermined preferences for patients, possible temporal interdependencies between services, and Continuity of Care (CoC) are taken into account. We also added some important constraints related to blood sampling requirements, which make our proposed model more complex. The proposed model is a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that belongs to an NP-hard class of optimization problems. To solve such a complex mathematical model, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed to find near-optimal solutions. We use some randomly generated test instances with different sizes to evaluate the performance of the GA. Finally, it is demonstrated how the proposed solution scheme can end up with proper scheduling and routing policies compared to those obtained through exact methods. © 2021 Sharif University of Technology.

In this paper, by clustering multiple users into independent communities based on their geographic locations, we design a 5G-enabled UAV-to-community offloading system. A system throughput maximization problem is formulated, subjected to the transmission rate, atomicity of tasks and speed of UAVs. By relaxing the transmission rate constraint, the mixed integer non-linear program is transformed into two subproblems. We first develop an average throughput maximization-based auction algorithm to determine the trajectory of UAVs, where a community-based latency approximation algorithm is developed to regulate the designed auction bidding. Then, a dynamic task admission algorithm is proposed to solve the task scheduling subproblem within one community. Performance analyses demonstrate that our designed auction bidding can guarantee user truthfulness, and can be fulfilled in polynomial time. Extensive simulations based on real-world data in health monitoring and online YouTube video services show that our proposed algorithm is able to maximize the system throughput while guaranteeing the fraction of served users. © 1983-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Scheduling the maintenance based on the condition, respectively the degradation level of the system leads to improved system's reliability while minimizing the maintenance cost. Since the degradation level changes dynamically during the system's operation, we face a dynamic maintenance scheduling problem. In this paper, we address the dynamic maintenance scheduling of manufacturing systems based on their degradation level. The manufacturing system consists of several units with a defined capacity and an individual dynamic degradation model, seeking to optimize their reward. The units sell their production capacity, while maintaining the systems based on the degradation state to prevent failures. The manufacturing units are jointly responsible for fulfilling the demand of the system. This induces a coupling constraint among the agents. Hence, we face a large-scale mixed-integer dynamic maintenance scheduling problem. In order to handle the dynamic model of the system and large-scale optimization, we propose a distributed algorithm using model predictive control (MPC) and Benders decomposition method. In the proposed algorithm, first, the master problem obtains the maintenance scheduling for all the agents, and then based on this data, the agents obtain their optimal production using the distributed MPC method which employs the dual decomposition approach to tackle the coupling constraints among the agents. The effectiveness of the proposed method is investigated on two case studies. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In order to reduce the energy consumption of furnaces and save costs in the product delivery time, the focus of this paper is to discuss the uncertainty of demand in the rolling horizon and to globally optimize the sustainability of the production in the aluminum furnace hot rolling section in environmental and economic dimensions. First, the triples α /β /γ are used to describe the production scheduling in the aluminum furnace hot rolling section as the scheduling of flexible flow shop, satisfied to constraints of demand uncertainty, operation logic, operation time, capacity and demand, objectives of minimizing the residence time of the ingot in the furnace and minimizing the makespan. Second, on the basis of describing the uncertainty of demand in rolling horizon with the scenario tree, a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model for sustainable production in the aluminum furnace hot rolling section is formulated. Finally, an aluminum alloy manufacturer is taken as an example to illustrate the proposed model. The computational results show that when the objective weight combination takes the value of α =0.7, β =0.3, the sustainability indicators of the environmental and economic dimensions can be optimized to the maximum extent possible at the same time. Increasingly, managerial suggestions associated with the trade-off between environmental and economic dimensions are presented. Scheduling in the rolling horizon can optimize the production process of the aluminum furnace hot rolling section globally, indicating that it is more conducive to the sustainable development of the environment and economic dimensions than scheduling in a single decision time period. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {To minimize energy consumption in today's industry, holistic energy efficiency solutions are required. The Energy Hub is a promising concept for optimal energy management of industrial systems with multiple energy carriers like electricity, heat, or gas. However, most of the research conducted in this field focuses on optimal energy management and does not consider the scheduling of product in manufacturing processes. Though, including production scheduling in the energy optimization of manufacturing processes can considerably increase energy efficiency, especially if batch processes are involved. This work identifies the potential of combined energy and production scheduling in Industrial Energy Hubs, using a chipboard production process as a use case. The chipboard production plant includes a combined heat and power unit, units for production, and has two district heating demands as external requirements. A generic modeling and optimization framework, based on mixed-integer linear programming, is used to model and optimize different scenarios. The results show that the scheduling of product has a significant impact on the energy management of the chipboard production plant: The required energy for the production units can be reduced by approximately 30 %. Nevertheless, this potential can only be exploited if process design is adapted and excess heat is utilized appropriately. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of jointly optimizing train stop plan and timetable for a set of trains on a railway corridor, with focus on time-dependent passenger demand: these are very relevant elements in railway operations, and closely related to the service quality provided to the passengers. The train stop planning problem requires to determine the stopping pattern for each train, while the train timetabling problem calls for finding departure and arrival times of each train at each visited station. The solution of both problems determines the train services available to the passengers, with the corresponding stops, the departure and arrival times, and the total travel time. To define train services that are convenient for the passengers, it is important to satisfy the passenger demand: in particular, we take into consideration the desired departure time intervals of passengers from their origin station towards their destination station. Our goal is to determine a solution to the integrated problem that includes these three aspects (stop plan, timetable, time-dependent passenger demand). The integrated problem is solved at the tactical level, and includes constraints imposing that the demand is satisfied in the desired time intervals, and the train capacity is respected. The solution of the problem defines the train services, by determining the passenger flow on trains and the time intervals in which passengers have to be served. We formulate an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model for this integrated problem, and solve it with the commercial optimization solver CPLEX on a real-world instance of the Wuhan–Guangzhou high-speed railway line in China, by considering different time interval lengths in which the demand must be satisfied. In addition, we compare the obtained results with those determined by solving a model that neglects the time-dependency of the passenger demand. The computational results show that the train stop plan and timetable are deeply influenced by the desired departure time intervals of the passengers, and that neglecting time-dependency results in more than 30% of the passengers departing in a different time interval than the desired one. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Solutions to non-convex optimization problems can only be guaranteed to be local optima. For this reason, there is a need for methodologies that consistently provide low-cost solutions to the non-convex optimal scheduling problem. In this study, a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search initialization method for branch and bound solvers is proposed for the production planning of a combined heat and power unit with thermal heat storage in a district heating system. The optimization problem is formulated as a non-convex mixed-integer program, which is incorporated in a sliding time window framework. Here, the proposed initialization method offers lower-cost production planning compared to random initialization for larger time windows. For the test case, the proposed method lowers the yearly operational cost by more than 2,000,000 DKK per year.

These can handle multiple inputs and outputs, uncertainties in forecast data, and plant constraints, amongst other features. One of the main issues identified in the literature regarding deploying these controllers is the lack of experimental demonstrations using standard components and communication protocols. In this original work, the economic-MPC-based optimal scheduling of a real-world heat pump-based building energy plant is demonstrated, and its performance is evaluated against two conventional controllers. The demonstration includes the steps to integrate an optimization-based supervisory controller into a typical building automation and control system with off-the-shelf HVAC components and usage of state-of-art algorithms to solve a mixed integer quadratic problem. Technological benefits in terms of fewer constraint violations and a hardware-friendly operation with MPC were identified. Additionally, a strong dependency of the economic benefits on the type of load profile, system design and controller parameters was also identified. Future work for the quantification of these benefits, the application of machine learning algorithms, and the study of forecast deviations is also proposed. © 2021 by the authors.

This problem is complex due to all possible combinations for assigning ships to available compatible berths. This paper focuses on solving the Berth Allocation Problem (BAP) by optimising port operations using an innovative model. The problem analysed in this work deals with the Discrete and Dynamic Berth Allocation Problem (DDBAP). We propose a novel mathematical formulation expressed as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for solving the DDBAP. Furthermore, we adapted a metaheuristic solution approach based on the Bee Colony Optimisation (BCO) for solving large-sized combinatorial BAPs. In order to assess the solution performance and efficiency of the proposed model, we introduce a new set of instances based on real data of the Livorno port (Italy), and a comparison between the BCO algorithm and CPLEX in solving the DDBAP is performed. Additionally, the application of the proposed model to a real berth scheduling (Livorno port data) and a comparison with the Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) metaheuristic are carried out.

	abstract = {Polymer flooding is one of the most extensively applied techniques for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) that relies on increasing the injected fluid viscosity by adding polymers in different concentrations. The aim is to improve the mobility ratio between the oil and the displacing fluid, reducing channeling effects and boosting sweep efficiency. In this work, a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization approach is developed in order to address production planning decisions, also assessing the convenience of polymer flooding in EOR projects on screening stages. This decision-making tool allows establishing optimal polymer injection strategies, setting fluid injection rates and polymer concentrations, selecting wells, and scheduling slug change operations over the planning horizon, with the aim of maximizing the net present value of the project. We propose a novel formulation combining transport phenomenon models, well productivity forecast, and geometric abstraction of the reservoir in order to address both technical and economic decisions with low computational effort. Results show that optimized strategies may outperform typical operations by up to 17% and can be found in shorter central processing unit times in comparison to traditional reservoir simulation approaches. The model has been used to tackle problems with up to 7 wells and can be tuned to different reservoir conditions.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Distributed flow shop scheduling of a camshaft machining is an important optimization problem in the automobile industry. The previous studies on distributed flow shop scheduling problem mainly emphasized homogeneous factories (shop types are identical from factory to factory) and economic criterion (e.g., makespan and tardiness). Nevertheless, heterogeneous factories (shop types are varied in different factories) and environment criterion (e.g., energy consumption and carbon emission) are inevitable because of the requirement of practical production and life. In this article, we address this energy-efficient scheduling of distributed flow shop with heterogeneous factories for the first time, where contains permutation and hybrid flow shops. First, a new mathematical model of this problem with objectives of minimization makespan and total energy consumption is formulated. Then, a hybrid multiobjective optimization algorithm, which integrates the iterated greedy (IG) and an efficient local search, is designed to provide a set of tradeoff solutions for this problem. Furthermore, the parameter setting of the proposed algorithm is calibrated by using a Taguchi approach of design-of-experiment. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, it is compared against other well-known multiobjective optimization algorithms including MOEA/D, NSGA-II, MMOIG, SPEA2, AdaW, and MO-LR in an automobile plant of China. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms these six state-of-the-art multiobjective optimization algorithms in this real-world instance.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In distributed computing frameworks like MapReduce, Spark, and Dyrad, a coflow is a set of flows transferring data between two stages of a job. The job cannot start its next stage unless all flows in the coflow finish. To improve the execution performance of such a job, it is crucial to reduce the completion time of a coflow, as it can contribute more than 50 percent of the job completion time. While several coflow schedulers have been proposed, we observe that routing, as a factor greatly impacting the Coflow Completion Time (CCT), has not been well considered. In this article, we focus on the coflow scheduling problem and jointly consider routing and bandwidth allocation. We begin by providing an analytical solution to the problem of optimal bandwidth allocation with pre-determined routes. In the following, we formulate the problem of scheduling a single coflow as a Non-linear Mixed Integer Programming problem and present its relaxed convex optimization problem. We further propose two algorithms, CoRBA and its simplified version: CoRBA-fast that solve the single coflow scheduling problem with a joint consideration of routing and bandwidth allocation. Lastly, to address multiple coflows in online scheduling, we propose an online scheduler named OnCoRBA. By comparing with the start-of-the-art algorithms and schedulers via simulations, we demonstrate that CoRBA and CoRBA-fast reduce the CCT by 30-400 percent and the OnCoRBA scheduler reduces the average online CCT by 20-230 percent. In addition, CoRBA-fast can be hundreds times faster than CoRBA with around 8 percent performance degradation compared to CoRBA, which makes the use of CoRBA-fast very appropriate in practice.  © 1990-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Heatstroke is becoming an increasingly serious threat to outdoor activities, especially, at the time of large events organized during summer, including the Olympic Games or various types of happenings in amusement parks like Disneyland or other popular venues. The risk of heatstroke is naturally affected by a high temperature, but it is also dependent on various other contextual factors such as the presence of shaded areas along traveling routes or the distribution of relief stations. The purpose of the study is to develop a method to reduce the heatstroke risk of pedestrians for large outdoor events by optimizing relief station placement, volume scheduling and route. Results: Our experiments conducted on the planned site of the Tokyo Olympics and simulated during the two weeks of the Olympics schedule indicate that planning routes and setting relief stations with our proposed optimization model could effectively reduce heatstroke risk. Besides, the results show that supply volume scheduling optimization can further reduce the risk of heatstroke. The route with the shortest length may not be the route with the least risk, relief station and physical environment need to be considered and the proposed method can balance these factors. Conclusions: This study proposed a novel emergency service problem that can be applied in large outdoor event scenarios with multiple walking flows. To solve the problem, an effective method is developed and evaluates the heatstroke risk in outdoor space by utilizing context-aware indicators which are determined by large and heterogeneous data including facilities, road networks and street view images. We propose a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming model for optimizing routes of pedestrians, determining the location of relief stations and the supply volume in each relief station. The proposed method can help organizers better prepare for the event and pedestrians participate in the event more safely. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In this paper, a deterministic bounding procedure for the global optimization of a mixed-integer bi-level programming problem is proposed. The aim has been to develop an efficient algorithm to deal with a case study in the electricity retail market. In this problem, an electricity retailer wants to define a time-of-use tariff structure to maximize profits, but he has to take into account the consumers’ reaction by means of re-scheduling appliance operation to minimize costs. The problem has been formulated as a bi-level mixed-integer programming model. The algorithm we propose uses optimal-value-function reformulations based on similar principles as the ones that have been used by other authors, which are adapted to the characteristics of this type of (pricing optimization) problems where no upper (lower) level variables appear in the lower (upper) level constraints. The overall strategy consists of generating a series of convergent upper bounds and lower bounds for the upper-level objective function until the difference between these bounds is below a given threshold. Computational results are presented as well as a comparison with a hybrid approach combining a particle swarm optimization algorithm to deal with the upper-level problem and an exact solver to tackle the lower-level problem, which we have previously developed to address a similar case study. When the lower-level model is difficult, a significant relative MIP gap is unavoidable when solving the algorithm's subproblems. Novel reformulations of those subproblems using “elastic” variables are proposed trying to obtain meaningful lower/upper bounds within an acceptable computational time. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Medical waste is a specific type of MSW which is generally divided into two categories: infectious and non-infectious. Wastes generated by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are classified among infectious medical wastes; moreover, these wastes are hazardous because they threaten the environment and living organisms if they are not appropriately managed. This paper develops a bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model for medical waste management during the COVID-19 outbreak. The proposed model minimizes the total costs and risks, simultaneously, of the population's exposure to pollution. This paper considers some realistic assumptions for the first time, including location-routing problem, time window-based green vehicle routing problem, vehicles scheduling, vehicles failure, split delivery, population risk, and load-dependent fuel consumption to manage both infectious and non-infectious medical waste.

	abstract = {In this article, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless network is considered in which a battery-constrained UAV is assumed to move towards energy-constrained ground nodes to receive status updates about their observed processes. The UAV's flight trajectory and scheduling of status updates are jointly optimized with the objective of minimizing the normalized weighted sum of Age of Information (NWAoI) values for different physical processes at the UAV. The problem is first formulated as a mixed-integer program. Then, for a given scheduling policy, a convex optimization-based solution is proposed to derive the UAV's optimal flight trajectory and time instants on updates. However, finding the optimal scheduling policy is challenging due to the combinatorial nature of the formulated problem. Therefore, to complement the proposed convex optimization-based solution, a finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) is used to find the optimal scheduling policy. Since the state space of the MDP is extremely large, a novel neural combinatorial-based deep reinforcement learning (NCRL) algorithm using deep Q-network (DQN) is proposed to obtain the optimal policy. However, for large-scale scenarios with numerous nodes, the DQN architecture cannot efficiently learn the optimal scheduling policy anymore. Motivated by this, a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based autoencoder is proposed to map the state space to a fixed-size vector representation in such large-scale scenarios while capturing the spatio-temporal interdependence between the update locations and time instants. A lower bound on the minimum NWAoI is analytically derived which provides system design guidelines on the appropriate choice of importance weights for different nodes. Furthermore, an upper bound on the UAV's minimum speed is obtained to achieve this lower bound value. The numerical results also demonstrate that the proposed NCRL approach can significantly improve the achievable NWAoI per process compared to the baseline policies, such as weight-based and discretized state DQN policies.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Motivated by mail delivery scheduling problems arising in Royal Mail, we study a generalization of the fundamental makespan scheduling P| | Cmax problem which we call the bounded job start scheduling problem. Given a set of jobs, each specified by an integer processing time pj, that have to be executed non-preemptively by a set of m parallel identical machines, the objective is to compute a minimum makespan schedule subject to an upper bound g≤ m on the number of jobs that may simultaneously begin per unit of time. With perfect input knowledge, we show that Longest Processing Time First (LPT) algorithm is tightly 2-approximate. After proving that the problem is strongly NP-hard even when g= 1 , we elaborate on improving the 2-approximation ratio for this case. We distinguish the classes of long and short instances satisfying pj≥ m and pj< m, respectively, for each job j. We show that LPT is 5/3-approximate for the former and optimal for the latter. Then, we explore the idea of scheduling long jobs in parallel with short jobs to obtain tightly satisfied packing and bounded job start constraints. For a broad family of instances excluding degenerate instances with many very long jobs, we derive a 1.985-approximation ratio. For general instances, we require machine augmentation to obtain better than 2-approximate schedules. In the presence of uncertain job processing times, we exploit machine augmentation and lexicographic optimization, which is useful for P| | Cmax under uncertainty, to propose a two-stage robust optimization approach for bounded job start scheduling under uncertainty aiming in a low number of used machines. Given a collection of schedules of makespan ≤ D, this approach allows distinguishing which are the more robust. We substantiate both the heuristics and our recovery approach numerically using Royal Mail data. We show that for the Royal Mail application, machine augmentation, i.e., short-term van rental, is especially relevant. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Preventive maintenance is applied in distribution networks to prevent failures by performing maintenance actions on components that are at risk. Distributed generators (DGs) and batteries can be used to support power to nearby loads when they are isolated due to maintenance. In this paper, a novel short-term preventive maintenance method is proposed that explicitly considers the support potential of DGs and batteries as well as uncertainties in the power generated by the DGs. Two major issues are addressed. To deal with the large-scale complexity of the network, a depth-first-search clustering method is used to divide the network into zones. Moreover, a method is proposed to capture the influence of maintenance decisions in the model of the served load from DGs and batteries via generation of topological constraints. Then a stochastic scenario-based mixed-integer non-linear programming problem is formulated to determine the short-term maintenance schedule. We show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach via a case study based on a modified IEEE-34 bus distribution network, where we also compare a branch-and-bound and a particle swarm optimization solver. The results also show that the supporting potential of DGs and batteries in preventive maintenance scheduling allows a significant reduction of load losses. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As a result of advances in technology and highly demanding users expectations, more and more applications require intensive computing resources and, most importantly, high consumption of data distributed throughout the environment. For this reason, there has been an increasing number of research efforts to cooperatively use geographically distributed resources, working in parallel and sharing resources and data. In fact, an application can be structured into a set of tasks organized through interdependent relationships, some of which can be effectively executed in parallel, notably speeding up the execution time. In this work a model is proposed aimed at offloading tasks execution in heterogeneous environments, considering different nodes computing capacity connected through distinct network bandwidths, and located at different distances. In the envisioned model, the focus is on the overhead produced when accessing remote data sources as well as the data transfer cost generated between tasks at run-time. The novelty of this approach is that the mechanism proposed for tasks allocation is data-flow aware, considering the geographical location of both, computing nodes and data sources, ending up in an optimal solution to a highly complex problem. Two optimization strategies are proposed, the Optimal Matching Model and the Staged Optimization Model, as two different approaches to obtain a solution to the task scheduling problem. In the optimal model approach a global solution for all application's tasks is considered, finding an optimal solution. Differently, the staged model approach is designed to obtain a local optimal solution by stages. In both cases, a mixed integer linear programming model has been designed intended to minimizing the application execution time. In the studies carried out to evaluate this proposal, the staged model provides the optimal solution in 76% of the simulated scenarios, while it also dramatically reduces the solving time with respect to optimal. Both models have pros and cons and, in fact, can be used together to complement each other. The optimal model finds the global optimal solution at high running time cost, which makes this model unpractical on some scenarios. The staged model instead, is faster enough to be used on those scenarios; however, the given solution might not be optimal in some cases. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Maritime transportation is preferred over other transportation forms for trade and has seen a significant increase worldwide. One of the problems that often occur in maritime transportation is the high cost because vessels' availability and capacity will always be the same while the demand tends to increase and erratic for each period. A mathematical model was developed in this study to determine the optimal value of container cargo and shipping frequency simultaneously to minimise the shipping cost for each voyage. To solve the container cargo optimisation problem, we presented an integer linear program, while for the scheduling, we used the greedy algorithm. Microsoft Excel Solver and LINDO software were used to solve the problem in this study. We provided computational calculations to simulate our mathematical model. The results show that the developed model produces feasible solutions for all scenarios due to the objective function and the constraints. Overall, our scheduling results can reduce the shipping frequency. The optimal solution value of container cargo and the scheduling results for each scenario are different because the total number of transported containers for each scenario is different. © 2021 The Authors},

The first stage consists of m machines fabricating m types of components, whereas the second stage has a single machine to assemble the components into the final product. In the flow shop, the assembly operations in the second stage should start within the limited waiting times after those components complete in the first stage. For this problem, a mixed-integer programming formulation is provided, and this formulation is used to find an optimal solution using a commercial optimization solver CPLEX. As this problem is proved to be NP‐hard, various heuristic algorithms (priority rule‐based list scheduling, constructive heuristic, and me-taheuristic) are proposed to solve a large‐scale problem within a short computation time. To evalu-ate the proposed algorithms, a series of computational experiments, including the calibration of the metaheuristics, were performed on randomly generated problem instances, and the results showed outperformance of the proposed iterated greedy algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in small‐ and large‐sized problems, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {In today's competitive environment, it is essential to design a flexible-responsive manufacturing system with automatic material handling systems. In this article, a fuzzy mixed integer linear programming model is designed for cell formation problems including the scheduling of parts within cells in a cellular manufacturing system (CMS) where several automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are in charge of transferring the exceptional parts. Notably, using these AGVs in CMS can be challenging from the perspective of mathematical modeling due to consideration of AGVs' collision as well as parts pickup/delivery. This article investigates the role of AGVs and human factors as indispensable components of automation systems in the cell formation and scheduling of parts under fuzzy processing time. The proposed objective function includes minimizing the makespan and intercellular movements of parts. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA/heuristic) and a whale optimization algorithm (WOA) are developed. The experimental results reveal that our proposed algorithms have a high performance compared to CPLEX and the other two well-known algorithms, i.e., particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization, in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy. Finally, WOA stands out as the best algorithm to solve the problem. © 1993-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Capacity at overly congested airports is managed through the allocation of slots for landing and take-off according to the IATA Worldwide Slot Guidelines. Under this scheme, slots are allocated over a six month scheduling season, and requests are typically made in series i.e. requests are made for the same time and days of the week over a given period. Although allocating slots in series has the advantage of preserving schedule regularity, it causes blocking with a detrimental effect on capacity utilization. Blocking occurs when the allocation of a given series of slots prevents the allocation of another series due to capacity constraints even though the days of the two requests do no coincide. In this paper we investigate blocking mitigation strategies. We introduce a model and solution framework that minimises blocking while maintaining a desirable level of schedule regularity. We also investigate a strategy that reduces the effect of blocking by changing parametrically the length of the period defining a series a slots. We test both strategies under hierarchical and holistic slot allocation policies using real slot request data from a congested airport. We compare the two strategies in terms of their effect on slot scheduling efficiency and schedule regularity, and we provide slot allocation policy recommendations. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {We propose an online algorithm for clustering channel-states and learning the associated achievable multiuser rates. Our motivation stems from the complexity of multiuser scheduling. For instance, MU-MIMO scheduling involves the selection of a user subset and associated rate selection each time-slot for varying channel states (the vector of quantized channels matrices for each of the users) - a complex integer optimization problem that is different for each channel state. Instead, our algorithm clusters the collection of channel states to a much lower dimension, and for each cluster provides achievable multiuser capacity trade-offs, which can be used for user and rate selection. Our algorithm uses a bandit approach, where it learns both the unknown partitions of the channel-state space (channel-state clustering) as well as the rate region for each cluster along a pre-specified set of directions, by observing the success/failure of the scheduling decisions (e.g. through packet loss). We propose an epoch-greedy learning algorithm that achieves a sub-linear regret, given access to a class of classifying functions over the channel-state space. We empirically validate our approach on a high-fidelity 5G New Radio (NR) wireless simulator developed within ATT Labs. We show that our epoch-greedy bandit algorithm learns the channel-state clusters and the associated rate regions. Further, adaptive scheduling using this learned rate-region model (map from channel-state to the set of feasible rates) outperforms the corresponding hand-tuned static maps in multiple settings. Thus, we believe that auto-tuning cellular systems through learning-assisted scheduling algorithms can significantly improve performance in real deployments.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.},

To enhance the system performance, we jointly design the UAV's trajectory and its maximum AN transmit power together with the user scheduling strategy subject to practical constraints, e.g., a covertness constraint, which is explicitly determined by analyzing each USU's detection performance, and a binary constraint induced by user scheduling. The formulated design problem is a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem, which is challenging to solve directly, but tackled by our developed penalty successive convex approximation (P-SCA) scheme. An efficient UAV trajectory initialization is also presented based on the successive hover-and-fly (SHAF) trajectory, which also serves as a benchmark scheme.

	abstract = {The integration of the European markets has started with the successful coupling of spot markets (day-ahead and intra-day) and is expected to continue with the coupling of balancing markets. In this paper, the optimization model for the activation of manual frequency restoration reserve (mFRR) is presented. The model incorporates all order types agreed among the European transmission system operators (TSOs) to be included in the Manually Activated Reserves Initiative (MARI) project. Additionally, the model incorporates the buying curve (demand) of mFRR with the possible tolerance band defined by the TSOs, order clearing constraints and the cross-zonal capacity (CZC) constraints, forming a mixed integer linear programming model. The methodology employs two distinct steps: In the first step, an order conversion process is employed for the markets applying the central-scheduling scheme, and in the second step, the mFRR activation process is executed by solving the presented model. The whole process is tested using a case, including twenty-five European control areas. The attained clearing results indicate that price convergence is achieved among the involved control areas, along with a reduction in the overall balancing costs mainly due to the imbalance netting that is implicitly performed during the joint mFRR balancing energy (BE) clearing process and due to the cross-border exchange of mFRR BE. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Scarce water resources have made production planning a key management decision in the agriculture sector, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. To address this issue, farmers can gradually adopt low-water-use crops, such as guar and guayule, which have great potential for the agricultural economy of the Southwestern U.S. The farmers’ profits can be further increased by reducing machinery transportation costs through optimized scheduling. For such purpose, this paper introduces a farm production planning and machinery scheduling optimization model for perennial and non-perennial crops that maximizes the farmers’ net present value. The optimization model allows for multi-crop production planning, multi-machinery scheduling, and crop rotation. To address the water scarcity problem in arid and semi-arid regions, perennial and non-perennial low-water-use crops can be considered in the crop rotation. Based on the Geographic Information System, the optimal scheduling routes are determined and the irrigation water requirements are analyzed. The resulting model yields a complex large-scale integer linear optimization problem. The model is assessed on two case studies, one for the guar crop (non-perennial) considering parcels located at the Cochran and Hockley counties in Texas and another case study for the guayule crop (perennial) considering parcels located in Pinal County in Arizona. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Recently, multi-energy systems (MESs), whereby different energy carriers are coupled together, have become popular. For a more efficient use of MESs, the optimal operation of these systems needs to be considered. This paper focuses on the day-ahead optimal schedule of an MES, including a combined heat and electricity (CHP) unit, a gas boiler, a PV system, and energy storage devices. Starting from a day-ahead PV point forecast, a non-parametric probabilistic forecast method is proposed to build the predicted interval and represent the uncertainty of PV generation. Afterwards, the MES is modeled as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), and the scheduling problem is solved by interval optimization. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a case study is performed on a real industrial MES. The simulation results show that, by using only historical PV measurement data, the point forecaster reaches a normalized root-mean square error (NRMSE) of 14.24%, and the calibration of probabilistic forecast is improved by 10% compared to building distributions around point forecast. Moreover, the results of interval optimization show that the uncertainty of the PV system not only has an influence on the electrical part of the MES, but also causes a shift in the behavior of the thermal system. © 2021 by the authors.

On the other hand, it is vital to guarantee the timeliness of information for UAV-assisted data collection. In this paper, we propose a time-efficient data collection scheme, in which multiple ground devices upload their data to the UAV via uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The total flight time of the UAV is equally divided into N time slots. The duration of each time slot is minimized by jointly optimizing the straight-line trajectory, device scheduling, and transmit power. To solve this mixed integer non-convex optimization problem, we decompose it into two steps. In the first step, we study the device scheduling strategy based on the UAV trajectory and the channel gains between the UAV and ground devices, through which the original problem can be greatly simplified. In the second step, the duration of each time slot is minimized by optimizing the transmit power and the UAV trajectory. An iterative algorithm based on alternating optimization is proposed, where each subproblem can be alternatively solved by applying successive convex approximation with the device scheduling updated at the end of each iteration. Numerical results are presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

The proposed economic dispatch model ensures the co-optimization of energy and reserves with pre- and post-contingency transmission switching actions, thus producing the optimal policy with transmission flexibility. An exact decomposition methodology based on the nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm is devised to address the challenging mixed-integer program arising from the proposed formulation.

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile edge computing has been recognized as a promising technology to flexibly and efficiently handle computation-intensive and latency-sensitive tasks in the era of fifth generation (5G) and beyond. In this paper, we study the problem of Service Provisioning for UAV-enabled mobile edge computiNg (SPUN). Specifically, under task latency requirements and various resource constraints, we jointly optimize the service placement, UAV movement trajectory, task scheduling, and computation resource allocation, to minimize the overall energy consumption of all terrestrial user equipments (UEs). Due to the non-convexity of the SPUN problem as well as complex coupling among mixed integer variables, it is a non-convex mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To solve this challenging problem, we propose two alternating optimization-based suboptimal solutions with different time complexities. In the first solution with relatively high complexity in the worst case, the joint service placement and task scheduling subproblem, and UAV trajectory subproblem are iteratively solved by the Branch and Bound (BnB) method and successive convex approximation (SCA), respectively, while the optimal solution to the computation resource allocation subproblem is efficiently obtained in the closed form. To avoid the high complexity caused by BnB, in the second solution, we propose a novel approximation algorithm based on relaxation and randomized rounding techniques for the joint service placement and task scheduling subproblem, while the other two subproblems are solved in the same way as that of the first solution. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed solutions achieve significantly lower energy consumption of UEs compared to three benchmarks. © 1983-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A high charging demand from many electric vehicles (EVs) at a fixed charging station (FCS) with a limited number of charging poles can increase the waiting time of EVs and yield an abnormal power grid condition. To resolve these challenges, this paper presents an optimization framework in which a mobile charging station (MCS) is dispatched to the overloaded FCS to reduce the number of waiting EVs while maintaining normal power grid operation. Compared to existing MCS scheduling methods that do not consider actual power distribution system operations, the proposed framework takes into account the (i) active/reactive power flow and consumption of EVs, (ii) reactive power capability of MCS, and (iii) voltage quality in power distribution systems. In coupled transportation and power distribution systems, the proposed algorithm conducts optimal operation scheduling of MCS for both road routing and charging and discharging, thereby leading to the reduction of waiting EVs within the allowable voltage range. The proposed MCS optimization algorithm was tested in IEEE 13-bus and 33-bus distribution systems coupled with 9-node and 15-node transportation systems, respectively. The test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of number of waiting EVs, voltage magnitude deviation, and reactive power of the MCS. © 2021 by the authors.

However, since the real-time deployment of these services is uncertain, ensuring their availability requires merchant ESS to fully reserve the associated energy capacity in their day-ahead schedule. To improve such conservative policies, we propose a data-driven probabilistic characterization of the real-time balancing stage to inform the day-ahead scheduling problem of an ESS owner. This distributional information is used to enforce a tailored probabilistic guarantee on the availability of the scheduled reserve capacity via chance constrained programming, which allows a profit-maximizing participation in energy, reserve and balancing markets. The merit order-based competition with rival resources in reserve capacity and balancing markets is captured via a bi-level model, which is reformulated as a computationally efficient mixed-integer linear problem. Results show that a merchant ESS owner may leverage the competition effect to avoid violations of its energy capacity limits, and that the proposed risk-aware method allows sourcing more reserve capacity, and thus more value, from storage, without jeopardizing the real-time reliability of the power system.  © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The fast development of technologies in the smart grids provides new opportunities such as co-optimization of multi-energy systems. One of the new concepts that can utilize multiple energy sources is a hybrid fuel station (HFS). For instance, an HFS can benefit from energy hubs, renewable energies, and natural gas sources to supply electric vehicles along with natural gas vehicles. However, the optimal operation of an HFS deals with uncertainties from different sources that do not have similar natures. Some may lack in term of historical data, and some may have very random and unpredictable behavior. In this study, we present a stochastic mathematical framework to address both types of these uncertainties according to the innate nature of each uncertain variable, namely: epistemic uncertainty variables (EUVs) and aleatory uncertainty variables (AUVs). Also, the imprecise probability approach is introduced for EUVs utilizing the copula theory in the process, and a scenario-based approach combining Monte Carlo simulation with Latin Hypercube sampling is applied for AUVs. The proposed framework is employed to address the daily operation of a novel HFS, leading to a two-stage mixed-integer linear programming problem.

	abstract = {We introduce a new optimization problem arising in the management of a multi-object spectrograph in a telescope. The field of view of the spectrograph is divided in 55 contiguous and parallel spatial bands. Each band is associated with two opposite sliding bars that can be positioned to observe an astronomical object. The observation of an object requires the synchronized configuration of the bars in several contiguous bands to form a slitlet in the position of the object. A multi-slit pattern for the bars permits the simultaneous observation of several objects requiring bars of different bands. Each astronomer using this spectrograph propose a list of objects to observe. Since the instrument is quite demanded, the manager of the telescope imposes a time limitation to the astronomers, so they need to select a subset of objects from their lists. This paper describes and solves the selection problem. The problem must also find a sequence of configurations for the bars in each band to maximize the total priority of the selection, subject to some synchronization issues and the time limitation. We show three mathematical formulations. One of them is a set-partitioning model where a master problem manages the synchronization constraints and a subproblem generates columns satisfying the time limitation. We propose two branch-and-price-and-cut algorithms for solving the set-partitioning model, and discuss an extensive computational experiment showing the performance of the algorithms on two families of instances. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The close interaction between the electricity market and the end-users can assist the demand response (DR) aggregator in handling and managing various uncertain parameters simultaneously to reduce their effect on the aggregator's operation. As the DR aggregator's main responsibility is to aggregate the obtained DR from individual consumers and trade it into the wholesale market. Another responsibility of the aggregator is proposing the DR programs (DRPs) to the end-users. This article proposes a model to handle these uncertainties through the development of a novel hybrid stochastic-robust optimization approach that incorporates the uncertainties around wholesale market prices and the participation rate of consumers. The behavior of the consumers engaging in DRPs is addressed through stochastic programming. Additionally, the volatility of the electricity market prices is modeled through a robust optimization method. Two DRPs are considered in this model to include both time-based and incentive-based DRPs, i.e., time-of-use and incentive-based DR program to study three sectors of consumers, namely industrial, commercial, and residential consumers. An energy storage system is also assumed to be operated by the aggregator to maximize its profit. The proposed mixed-integer linear hybrid stochastic-robust model improves the evaluation of DR aggregator's scheduling for the probable worst-case scenario. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the model is thoroughly simulated in a real case study. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the advancement of automation in transportation, the need to improve the operation efficiency of container terminals has increased. The most important determinant of container-handling efficiency is the productivity of equipment, such as quay cranes, automated lifting vehicles, storage yards, and yard cranes. Most previous studies have sought to optimize equipment assignments and scheduling independently and have considered only a loading or an unloading process. As loading and unloading processes occur simultaneously and the equipment operations are highly interrelated, it is important to direct the operations in an integrated manner that reflects the characteristics of automated container terminals. This paper presents a new mixed-integer programming model for analyzing the integrated problem of assigning resources and scheduling, which also considers the limited quantity of critical equipment. To solve the integrated optimization model, a genetic algorithm (GA) is developed. Since the critical equipment, such as yard cranes, are limited, and thus, restricting the efficiency of terminals, a sharing policy is proposed to improve the GA to shorten the operation time of both the loading and unloading processes. Experiments show that the improved GA proposed in this paper can obtain the optimal/near-optimal solutions in short CPU times, therefore it is efficient in solving the integrated equipment assignment and scheduling problem. The results obtained from the sharing policy are superior to those obtained from a non-sharing approach.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

To deal with an uncertain model, three different ranking criteria are being used to develop: a) Expected value, b) Optimistic value, c) Dependent optimistic value criterion. These mathematical models are transformed into their corresponding deterministic forms using the basic concepts of uncertainty theory. The deterministic model of DOCM consists of fractional objectives which are converted into their linear form using Charnes and Cooper’s transformation. These deterministic formulations MOFCAP are converted into a single objective problem by using the fuzzy programming technique with linear and exponential membership functions. Further, the single objective problem for all the defined models is solved in the Lingo 18.0 software to derive the Pareto-optimal solution. The sensitivity of the models is also performed to examine the variation in the objective function due to the variation in parameters. Finally, a numerical example is given to exhibit the application and algorithm of the models. © International Journal of Mathematical, Engineering and Management Sciences.

	abstract = {With increasing penetration of solar PV, some distribution feeders are experiencing highly variable net-load flows and even reverse flows. To optimize distribution systems under such conditions, the scheduling of mechanical devices, such as OLTCs and capacitor banks, needs to take into account forecasted solar PV and actual grid conditions. However, these legacy switching assets are operated on a daily or hourly timescale, due to the wear and tear associated with mechanical switching, which makes them unsuitable for real-time control. Therefore, there is a natural timescale-separation between these slower mechanical assets and the responsive nature of inverter-based resources. In this paper, we present a network admissible convex formulation for holistically scheduling controllable grid assets to position voltage optimally against solar PV. An optimal hourly schedule is presented that utilizes mechanical resources to position the predicted voltages close to nominal values, while minimizing the use of inverter-based resources (i.e., DERs), making them available for control at a faster time-scale (after the uncertainty reveals itself). A convex, inner approximation of the OPF problem is adapted to a mixed-integer linear program that minimizes voltage deviations from nominal (i.e., maximizes voltage margins). The resulting OPF solution respects all the network constraints and is, hence, robust against modeling simplifications.Simulation based analysis on IEEE distribution feeders validates the approach. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

The AUV monitors a set of physical processes, where the status of each process can be sensed by one or more devices and each device is capable of sensing one or more processes. The AUV needs to maintain freshness of its information status about the monitored processes. To quantify the freshness of the information at the AUV, we consider the concept of the age of information (AoI), which represents the amount of time elapsed since the most recently delivered update information was generated. A framework is proposed to optimize the AUV’s linear movement trajectory and scheduling of process status updates with the objective of minimizing the normalized weighted sum of the average AoI of the monitored physical processes. The formulated optimization problem is a non-convex mixed integer problem, which cannot be solved by the standard optimization techniques. We develop a solution approach based on the technique of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Specifically, we leverage an actor-critic DRL approach to find the optimum locations and stopping time of the data gathering points. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed framework maintains robustness under different scenarios and provides better performance when compared with baseline and K-means clustering approaches. 0018-9545 © 2021 IEEE.},

The developed planning of aircraft maintenance teams is a computer application based on a mathematical programming problem written as a minimization one. The initial decision variables are positive integer variables specifying the allocation of available technicians by skills to maintenance teams. The objective function is a nonlinear function balancing the time spent and costs incurred with aircraft fleet maintenance. The data involve technicians’ skills, hours of work to perform maintenance tasks, costs related to facilities, and the aircraft downtime cost. The realism of this planning entails random possibilities associated with maintenance workload data, and the inference by a procedure of Monte Carlo simulation provides a proper set of workloads, instead of going through all the possibilities. The based formalization is a nonlinear integer programming problem, converted into an equivalent pure linear integer programming problem, using a transformation from initial positive integer variables to Boolean ones. A case study addresses the use of this support information system to plan a team for aircraft maintenance of three lines under the uncertainty of workloads, and a discussion of results shows the serviceableness of the proposed support information system. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Long queues of arrival trucks are a common problem in seaports, and thus, carbon emissions generated from trucks in the queue cause environmental pollution. In order to relieve gate congestion and reduce carbon emissions, this paper proposes a lane allocation framework combining the truck appointment system (TAS) for four types of trucks. Based on the distribution of arrival times obtained from the TAS, lane allocation decisions in each appointment period are determined in order to minimize the total cost, including the operation cost and carbon emissions cost. The resultant optimization model is a non-linear fractional integer program. This model was firstly transformed to an equivalent integer program with bilinear constraints. Then, an improved branch-and-bound algorithm was designed, which includes further transforming the program into a linear program using the McCormick approximation method and iteratively generating a tighter outer approximation along the branch-and-bound procedure. Numerical studies confirmed the validity of the proposed model and algorithm, while demonstrating that the lane allocation decisions could significantly reduce carbon emissions and operation costs. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Linear optimal power flow (OPF) formulations are powerful tools applied to a large number of problems in power systems, e.g., economic dispatch, expansion planning, state estimation, congestion management, electricity markets, among others. This article proposes a novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the ac-OPF of three-phase unbalanced distribution networks. The model aims to minimize the total energy production cost while guaranteeing the network's voltage and current magnitude operational limits. New approximations of the Euclidean norm, which is present in the calculation of nodal voltage and branch current magnitudes, are introduced by applying a linear transformation of weighted norms and a set of intersecting planes. The accuracy, optimality, feasibility, and scalability of the proposed linearizations are compared with common linear approximations in the literature using two unbalanced distribution test systems. The obtained results show that the proposed formulation is computationally more efficient (almost twice) while being as accurate and more conservative than the benchmarked approaches with maximum errors lower than 0.1%. Thus, its potential application in a variety of distribution systems operation and planning optimization problems is endorsed.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Supply chain optimization concerns the improvement of the performance and efficiency of the manufacturing and distribution supply chain by making the best use of resources. In the context of supply chain optimization, scheduling has always been a challenging task for experts, especially when considering a distributed manufacturing system (DMS). The present study aims to tackle the supply chain scheduling problem in a DMS while considering two essential sustainability aspects, namely environmental and economic. The economic aspect is addressed by optimizing the total delivery time of order, transportation cost, and production cost while optimizing environmental pollution and the quality of products contribute to the environmental aspect. To cope with the problem, it is mathematically formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. Due to the complexity of the problem, an improved genetic algorithm (GA) named GA-TOPKOR is proposed. The algorithm is a combination of GA and TOPKOR, which is one of the multi-criteria decision-making techniques. To assess the efficiency of GA-TOPKOR, it is applied to a real-life case study and a set of test problems. The solutions obtained by the algorithm are compared against the traditional GA and the optimum solutions obtained from the MILP model. The results of comparisons collectively show the efficiency of the GA-TOPKOR. Analysis of results also revealed that using the TOPKOR technique in the selection operator of GA significantly improves its performance. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

With the recent increase in the number of electric vehicles (EVs), the seamless integration of IoV in EVs and charging infrastructure can offer environmentally sustainable and budget-friendly transportation. In this paper, we propose an IoV-based framework that consists of deployment and scheduling of a mobile charging infrastructure. For the deployment, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the total cost of mobile charging infrastructure placement while considering constraints on the number of EVs that can be charged simultaneously. The formulated problem is mixed-integer programming and solved by using the branch and bound algorithm. We then propose an IoV-based scheduling scheme for EVs charging to minimize travel distance and charging costs while satisfying the constraints of charging time requirement of EVs and resources of a charging station. We consider passive road sensors and traffic sensors in the proposed IoV-based scheduling scheme to enable EV users for finding a charging station that can fulfill their requirements, as well as to enable service providers to know about the demand in the area. Simulation results illustrate the significant impact of the optimal deployment of charging infrastructure and scheduling optimization on the efficiency of EVs charging.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

In practice, integrated optimization is often not possible because the necessary complete information cannot be exchanged between the systems. Often, industrial sites optimize the operation of production and utility systems sequentially without any feedback, which leads to suboptimal operation. In this paper, we propose a method to coordinate between production and utility systems in a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. The proposed method does not require complete information exchange. The only information exchanged in one feedback loop is the energy demand and demand-dependent energy cost. In two case studies, the method reduces the total production cost by 7.6% and 3.4% compared to the common sequential optimization. These cost savings correspond to 84% and 88% of the potential cost savings by an integrated optimization. In summary, the proposed method reduces cost significantly, while only incomplete information is exchanged between production and utility systems. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Parallel machine scheduling is one of the most common studied problems in recent years, however, this classic optimization problem has to achieve two conflicting objectives, i.e. minimizing the total tardiness and minimizing the total wastes, if the scheduling is done in the context of plastic injection industry where jobs are splitting and molds are important constraints. This paper proposes a mathematical model for scheduling parallel machines with splitting jobs and resource constraints. Two minimization objectives - the total tardiness and the number of waste - are considered, simultaneously. The obtained model is a bi-objective integer linear programming model that is shown to be of NP-hard class optimization problems. In this paper, a novel Multi-Objective Volleyball Premier League (MOVPL) algorithm is presented for solving the aforementioned problem. This algorithm uses the crowding distance concept used in NSGA-II as an extension of the Volleyball Premier League (VPL) that we recently introduced. Furthermore, the results are compared with six multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms of MOPSO, NSGA-II, MOGWO, MOALO, MOEA/D, and SPEA2. Using five standard metrics and ten test problems, the performance of the Pareto-based algorithms was investigated. The results demonstrate that in general, the proposed algorithm has supremacy than the other four algorithms. © 2020, The Author(s).},

The urgent jobs and limited waiting times are major considerations for scheduling in semiconductor manufacturing systems. The objective function is to minimize a weighted sum of total tardiness of urgent jobs and the makespan of normal jobs. This problem is formulated in mixed integer programming (MIP). By using a commercial optimization solver, the MIP can be used to find an optimal solution. However, because this problem is proved to be NP-hard, solving to optimality requires a significantly long computation time for a practical size problem. Therefore, this study adopts metaheuristic algorithms to obtain a good solution quickly.

	abstract = {Scheduling of megaprojects is very challenging because of typical characteristics, such as expected long project durations, many activities with multiple modes, scarce resources, and investment decisions. Furthermore, each megaproject has additional specific characteristics to be considered. Since the number of nuclear dismantling projects is expected to increase considerably worldwide in the coming decades, we use this type of megaproject as an application case in this paper. Therefore, we consider the specific characteristics of constrained renewable and non-renewable resources, multiple modes, precedence relations with and without no-wait condition, and a cost minimisation objective. To reliably plan at minimum costs considering all relevant characteristics, scheduling methods can be applied. But the extensive literature review conducted did not reveal a scheduling method considering the special characteristics of nuclear dismantling projects. Consequently, we introduce a novel scheduling problem referred to as the nuclear dismantling project scheduling problem. Furthermore, we developed and implemented an effective metaheuristic to obtain feasible schedules for projects with about 300 activities. We tested our approach with real-life data of three different nuclear dismantling projects in Germany. On average, it took less than a second to find an initial feasible solution for our samples. This solution could be further improved using metaheuristic procedures and exact optimisation techniques such as mixed-integer programming and constraint programming. The computational study shows that utilising exact optimisation techniques is beneficial compared to standard metaheuristics. The main result is the development of an initial solution finding procedure and an adaptive large neighbourhood search with iterative destroy and recreate operations that is competitive with state-of-the-art methods of related problems. The described problem and findings can be transferred to other megaprojects. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Among different local renewable resources, using battery energy storage (BES) has grown more than other technologies. The main reasons for this growth are flexibility and schedulability of BES. The fast ramp-rate of BES systems provides the opportunity of effective participation of these resources in the regulation ancillary service. However, continuous charging and discharging cycles of BES could decrease its lifetime and the expected profit, consequently. Therefore, the lifespan is a crucial parameter that shall be considered in the scheduling of BES. In this paper, an energy-constrained model is proposed for the scheduling of BES in joint energy and ancillary service markets. Moreover, the Energy Throughput (ET) concept is proposed for modeling the lifetime in the short-term scheduling strategy. In the proposed strategy, the uncertainties of energy prices in energy and regulation markets are modeled by Robust Optimization (RO) methodology. The scheduling problem is linearized and formulated based on the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) method. The proposed model determines the optimal scheduling of BES based on the profit maximization, operational constraints, lifespan, and the defined risk level.

	abstract = {To solve the problems of heavy computing load and system transmission pressure in energy internet (EI), we establish a three-tier cloud-edge integrated EI network based on a cloud-edge collaborative computing to achieve the tradeoff between energy consumption and the system delay. A joint optimization problem for resource allocation and task offloading in the three-tier cloud-edge integrated EI network is formulated to minimize the total system cost under the constraints of the task scheduling binary variables of each sensor node, the maximum uplink transmit power of each sensor node, the limited computation capability of the sensor node and the maximum computation resource of each edge server, which is a Mixed Integer Non-linear Programming (MINLP) problem. To solve the problem, we propose a joint task offloading and resource allocation algorithm (JTOARA), which is decomposed into three subproblems including the uplink transmission power allocation sub-problem, the computation resource allocation sub-problem, and the offloading scheme selection sub-problem. Then, the power allocation of each sensor node is achieved by bisection search algorithm, which has a fast convergence. While the computation resource allocation is derived by line optimization method and convex optimization theory. Finally, to achieve the optimal task offloading, we propose a cloud-edge collaborative computation offloading schemes based on game theory and prove the existence of Nash Equilibrium. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can improve output performance as comparing with the conventional algorithms, and its performance is close to the that of the enumerative algorithm.

	abstract = {The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) with the energy grid has become an important area of research due to the increasing EV penetration in today's transportation systems. Under appropriate management of EV charging and discharging, the grid can currently satisfy the energy requirements of a considerable number of EVs. Furthermore, EVs can help enhance the reliability and stability of the energy grid through ancillary services such as energy storage. This paper proposes the EV routing problem with time windows under time-variant electricity prices (EVRPTW-TP) which optimizes the routing of an EV fleet that are delivering products to customers, jointly with the scheduling of the charging and discharging of the EVs from/to the grid. The proposed model is a multiperiod vehicle routing problem where EVs can stop at charging stations to either recharge their batteries or inject stored energy to the grid. Given the energy costs that vary based on time-of-use, the charging and discharging schedules of the EVs are optimized to benefit from the capability of storing energy by shifting energy demands from peak hours to off-peak hours when the energy price is lower. The vehicles can recover the energy costs and potentially realize profits by injecting energy back to the grid at high price periods. EVRPTW-TP is formulated as an optimization problem. A Lagrangian relaxation approach and a hybrid variable neighborhood search/tabu search heuristic are proposed to obtain high quality lower bounds and feasible solutions, respectively. Numerical experiments on instances from the literature are provided. The proposed heuristic is also evaluated on a case study of an EV fleet providing grocery delivery at the region of Kitchener-Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. Insights on the impacts of energy pricing, service time slots, range reduction in winter as well as fleet size are presented. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The recharging plans are a key component of the electric bus schedule. Since the real-world charging function of electric vehicles follows a nonlinear relationship with the charging duration, it is challenging to accurately estimate the charging time. To provide a feasible bus schedule given the nonlinear charging function, this paper proposes a mixed integer programming model with a piecewise linear charging approximation and multi-depot and multi-vehicle type scheduling. The objective of the model is to minimise the total cost of the schedule, which includes the vehicle purchasing cost and operation cost. From a practical point of view, the number of line changes of each bus is also taken as one of the constraints in the optimisation. An improved heuristic algorithm is then proposed to find high-quality solutions of the problem with an efficient computation. Finally, a real-world dataset is used for the case study. The results of using different charging functions indicate a large deviation between the linear charging function and the piecewise linear approximation, which can effectively avoid the infeasible bus schedules. Moreover, the experiments show that the proposed line change constraints can be an effective control method for transit operators. © 2021, Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering.

This is developed for MGs that are islanded due to a scheduled interruption from the main grid, where minimizing both operational costs and load shedding is critical. The model introduced presents two main benefits. Firstly, an accurate second order cone power flow model (SOC-PF) is used, which ensures global optimality. Through a comparison with a piecewise linear power flow model on a modified IEEE 33 bus network, it is demonstrated that failure to accurately model power flow equations, can result in a significant underestimation of the operational cost of almost 12%. Secondly, uncertainty is modelled using a robust approach which allows trade-offs between the uncertainty that a MG operator is willing to tolerate, and performance. In this article, performance criteria considered are operational cost and load shedding. Market price, demand, renewable generation and islanding duration are considered as uncertain variables. Results show that by controlling the budget of uncertainty, the MG operator can achieve an almost 20% reduction in the operating cost, compared to a fully robust schedule, while achieving 0% probability of shedding more demand than expected.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This work addresses the Locomotive Scheduling Problem with Maintenance Constraints (LSPM). The basic Locomotive Scheduling Problem (LSP), which depicts one of the most crucial optimization problems occurring in the railway industry, aims at assigning a fleet of locomotives to a set of scheduled trains such that the overall costs are minimized. As the rolling stock represents one of the main costs of a rail company, the focus lies on maximizing the utilization of the locomotives. This requires the incorporation of special maintenance constraints that increase the computational difficulty of the problem significantly. In our previous work, we proposed a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming formulation for solving the LSPM and continue in this paper by investigating different heuristic solution approaches, i.e., an Overlapping Rolling Horizon Approach and a Two-Stage Matheuristic (2SMH). In the objective function, realistic costs for deadheading, the number of used locomotives and maintenance jobs are taken into account. An extensive computational study is conducted on instances with up to 2,290 trains derived from real-world data provided by RCA, the largest Austrian rail company for freight transportation. All solution approaches are analyzed in detail and compared against each other in order to show their benefits and disadvantages. We show that our approaches are capable of delivering high-quality solutions within short computation times. In fact, the performance of the 2SMH qualifies it to form the basis of a large scale real-time application to support railroad managers in their daily operations. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Industry 4.0 is being enabled by a number of new wireless technologies that emerged in the last decade, aiming to ultimately alleviate the need for wires in industrial use cases. However, wireless solutions are still neither as reliable nor as fast as their wired counterparts. Closed loop communication, a representative industrial communication scenario, requires high reliability (over 99%) and hard real-time operation, having very little tolerance for delays. Additionally, connectivity must be provided over an entire industrial side extending across hundreds of meters. IEEE 802.11ah fits this puzzle in terms of data rates and range, but it does not guarantee deterministic communication by default. Its Restricted Access Window (RAW), a new configurable medium access feature, enables flexible scheduling in dense, large-scale networks. However, the standard does not define how to configure RAW. The existing RAW configuration strategies assume uplink traffic only and are dedicated exclusively to sensors nodes. In this article, we present an integer nonlinear programming problem formulation for optimizing RAW configuration in terms of latency in closed loop communication between sensors and actuators, taking into account both uplink and downlink traffic. The model results in less than 1% of missed deadlines without any prior knowledge of the network parameters in heterogeneous time-changing networks.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In outpatient chemotherapy, nurses administer the drugs in two steps. In the first few minutes of each appointment, a nurse prepares the patient for infusion (drug administration). During the remainder of the appointment, the patient is monitored by nurses and if needed taken care of. One nurse must be assigned to prepare the patient and set up the infusion device. However, a nurse who is not busy setting up may simultaneously monitor up to a certain number of patients who are already receiving infusion. The prescribed infusion durations are significantly different among the patients on a day at a clinic. We formulate this problem as a multi-criterion mixed integer program. The appointments should be scheduled with start times close to patients’ ready times, balanced workload among nurses, few nurse changes during appointments, and few nurse full-time equivalent (FTE) assigned to the schedule of the day. As the number of nurse FTEs is an output of the model rather than a fixed input, the clinic can use the nursing capacity more efficiently, i.e., with less labor cost. We develop a 3-stage heuristic for finding criterion points with the minimum weighted average deferring time of appointments for the minimum feasible number of nurse FTEs or a desired value above that. By not constraining the number of chairs or beds, we can find solutions with better (dominating) criterion points. Drug preparation, oncologist visit, and the laboratory test can be scheduled based on the drug administration appointment start time. Thus, the drug administration resources are efficiently used with desirable performance in taking the interests and requirements of various stakeholders into consideration: patients, nurses, oncologists, pharmacy, and the clinic. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This article presents a novel solution technique for scheduling multi-energy system (MES) in a commercial urban building to perform price-based demand response and reduce energy costs. The MES scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP), a nonconvex NP-hard problem with uncertainties due to renewable generation and demand. A model predictive control approach is used to handle the uncertainties and price variations. This in-turn requires solving a time-coupled multitime step MINLP during each time-epoch, which is computationally intensive. This investigation proposes an approach called the scenario-based branch-and-bound (SB3), a light-weight solver to reduce the computational complexity. It combines the simplicity of convex programs with the ability of meta-heuristic techniques to handle complex nonlinear problems. The performance of the SB3 solver is validated in the Cleantech building, Singapore and the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces energy cost by about 17.26% and 22.46% as against solving a multi-time step heuristic optimization model. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Many regions of the world are currently struggling with congested airspace, and Europe is no exception. Motivated by our collaboration with relevant European authorities and companies in the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) initiative, we investigate novel mathematical models and algorithms for supporting the Air Traffic Flow Management in Europe. In particular, we consider the problem of optimally choosing new (delayed) departure times for a set of scheduled flights to prevent en-route congestion and high workload for air traffic controllers while minimizing the total delay. This congestion is a function of the number of flights in a certain sector of the airspace, which in turn determines the workload of the air traffic controller(s) assigned to that sector. We present a MIP model that accurately captures the current definition of workload, and extend it to overcome some of the drawbacks of the current definition. The resulting scheduling problem makes use of a novel formulation, Path&Cycle, which is alternative to the classic big-M or time-indexed formulations. We describe a solution algorithm based on delayed variable and constraint generation to substantially speed up the computation. We conclude by showing the great potential of this approach on randomly generated, realistic instances. © 2020 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {There are two opponents in a classic network interdiction problem, network owner/defender and interdictor/attacker. Each side has enough information about the other's possible courses of action. While the network user wishes to run the network in an optimal way, the attacker with the limited resources tries to prevent the optimal operation of the network by interdicting the arcs/nodes of the network. In this study, we investigate project management in a competitive environment using a network interdiction approach. We assume that the project owner/manager strives to minimize the completion time of a Critical Path Method (CPM) based project while an opponent attempts to maximize the minimum completion time by inflicting some delays on project activities with available interdiction resources. Considering both discrete and continuous delay times, we develop two bi-level mixed-integer programming models for the interdictor. Using duality, we then convert the bi-level models to standard single-level models, which are solvable through standard optimization packages. We extend these models to find efficient solutions in terms of project completion time and interdiction resources from the interdictor's perspective. In this respect, we develop an algorithm to find an efficient solution set for the interdictor. Next, from project manager's standpoint, we discuss the earliest and latest scheduling times of activities in case of interdiction. Finally, we apply the developed techniques in a marketing project aiming at introducing a new product. The findings may enhance a better project management in an environment where an opponent can adversely affect the project management process by delaying some activities.  © EDP Sciences, ROADEF, SMAI 2021.},

	abstract = {Passengers would like to choose the most suitable train based on their travel preferences, expenses, and train timetable in the high-speed railway corridor. Meanwhile, the railway department will constantly adjust the train timetable according to the distribution of passenger flows during a day to achieve the optimal operation cost and energy consumption saving plan. The question is how to meet the differential travel needs of passengers and achieve sustainable goals of service providers. Therefore, it is necessary to design a demand-oriented and environment-friendly high-speed railway timetable. This paper formulates the optimization of train timetable for a given high-speed railway corridor, which is based on the interests of both passengers and transportation department. In particular, a traveling time-space network with virtual departure arc is constructed to analyze generalized travel costs of passengers of each origin-destination (OD), and bilevel programming model is used to optimize the problem. The upper integer programming model regards the minimization of the operating cost, which is simplified to the minimum traveling time of total trains, as the goal. The lower level is a user equilibrium model which arranges each OD passenger flow to different trains. A general advanced metaheuristic algorithm embedded with the Frank-Wolfe method is designed to implement the bilevel programming model. Finally, a real-world numerical experiment is conducted to verify the effectiveness of both the model and the algorithm.  © 2021 Zhipeng Huang et al.},

	abstract = {Deutsche Bahn (DB) operates a large fleet of rolling stock (locomotives, wagons, and train sets) that must be combined into trains to perform rolling stock rotations. This train composition is a special characteristic of railway operations that distinguishes rolling stock rotation planning from the vehicle scheduling problems prevalent in other industries. DB models train compositions using hyperarcs. The resulting hypergraph models are addressed using a novel coarse-to-fine method that implements a hierarchical column generation over three levels of detail. This algorithm is the mathematical core of DB's fleet employment optimization (FEO) system for rolling stock rotation planning. FEO's impact within DB's planning departments has been revolutionary. DB has used it to support the company's procurements of its newest high-speed passenger train fleet and its intermodal cargo locomotive fleet for crossborder operations. FEO is the key to successful tendering in regional transport and to construction site management in daily operations. DB's planning departments appreciate FEO's high-quality results, ability to reoptimize (quickly), and ease of use. Both employees and customers benefit from the increased regularity of operations. DB attributes annual savings of 74 million euro, an annual reduction of 34,000 tons of CO2 emissions, and the elimination of 600 coupling operations in crossborder operations to the implementation of FEO. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Matheuristics have been gaining in popularity for solving combinatorial optimisation problems in recent years. This new class of hybrid method combines elements of both mathematical programming for intensification and metaheuristic searches for diversification. A recent approach in this direction has been to build a neighbourhood for integer programs by merging information from several heuristic solutions, namely construct, solve, merge and adapt (CMSA). In this study, we investigate this method alongside a closely related novel approach—merge search (MS). Both methods rely on a population of solutions, and for the purposes of this study, we examine two options: (a) a constructive heuristic and (b) ant colony optimisation (ACO); that is, a method based on learning. These methods are also implemented in a parallel framework using multi-core shared memory, which leads to improving the overall efficiency. Using a resource constrained job scheduling problem as a test case, different aspects of the algorithms are investigated. We find that both methods, using ACO, are competitive with current state-of-the-art methods, outperforming them for a range of problems. Regarding MS and CMSA, the former seems more effective on medium-sized problems, whereas the latter performs better on large problems. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Background: Truck scheduling at cross-docking terminals has received much academic attention over the last three decades. A vast number of mixed-integer programming models have been proposed to assign trucks to dock-doors and time slots. Surprisingly, only a few models assume fixed outbound truck departures that are often applied in the less-than-truckload or small parcel and express delivery industry. To the best of our knowledge, none of these papers explore whether a discrete-time or continuous-time model formulation has a better computational performance. This paper attempts to close this research gap and tries to shed light on which type of formulation is advantageous. Therefore, a variant of the truck scheduling problem with fixed outbound departures is considered. This problem's objective is to find a feasible truck schedule that minimizes the number of delayed freight units. Methods: We propose two model formulations for the described variant of the truck scheduling problem with fixed outbound departures. Specifically, the problem is formulated as a discrete-time and a continuous-time mixed-integer programming model. Results: A computational experiment is conducted in order to assess the computational performance of the presented model formulations. We compare the discrete-time and continuous-time formulation in terms of both the solution quality and computational time. Conclusions: The computational results show that the proposed discrete-time model formulation can solve problem instances of medium size to proven optimality within less than one minute. The continuous-time model formulation, on the other hand, can solve small instances to optimality. However, it requires longer solution times than the discrete-time formulation. Furthermore, it is unable to solve medium-sized instances within a 5-minute time limit. Thus, it can be summarized that the proposed discrete-time model formulation is clearly superior to the continuous-time model formulation. © Wyższa Szkoła Logistyki, Poznań, Polska.},

Each maintenance item involves various maintenance tasks and may require temporary equipment shutdowns, which are costly and highly disruptive to production. The aim is to minimise equipment shutdowns by grouping maintenance items with similar shutdown requirements into short-term maintenance operations called campaigns. Real plants can involve tens of thousands of maintenance items and thus manually scheduling the campaigns is an extreme challenge. In this paper, we develop a mixed-integer linear programming model for optimally allocating maintenance items to campaigns so that total shutdown cost is minimised. The model incorporates constraints on maintenance deadlines, campaign times, maintenance item suppression and labour hours per campaign. We solve the model for realistic scenarios involving data for Karratha Gas Plant in Western Australia, which is the main processing plant for the massive North West Shelf oil and gas project. © Operational Research Society 2020.},

	abstract = {NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) is a globally-spanning communications network responsible for supporting the interplanetary spacecraft missions of NASA and other international users. The DSN is a highly utilized asset, and the large demand for its' services makes the assignment of DSN resources a daunting computational problem. In this paper we study the DSN scheduling problem, which is the problem of assigning the DSN's limited resources to its users within a given time horizon. The DSN scheduling problem is oversubscribed, meaning that only a subset of the activities can be scheduled, and network operators must decide which activities to exclude from the schedule. We first formulate this challenging scheduling task as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization problem. Next, we develop a sequential algorithm which solves the resulting MILP formulation to produce valid schedules for large-scale instances of the DSN scheduling problem. We use real world DSN data from week 44 of 2016 in order to evaluate our algorithm's performance. We find that given a fixed run time, our algorithm outperforms a simple implementation of our MILP model, generating a feasible schedule in which 17% more activities are scheduled by the algorithm than by the simple implementation. We design a non-MILP based heuristic to further validate our results. We find that our algorithm also outperforms this heuristic, scheduling 8% more activities and 20% more tracking time than the best results achieved by the non-MILP implementation.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a risk-averse stochastic framework for short-term scheduling of virtual power plants (VPPs) in a competitive environment considering the potential of activating electric vehicles (EVs) and smart buildings in demand response (DR) programs. In this framework, a number of EV Parking Lots (PLs) which are under the jurisdiction of the VPP and its rivals are considered that compete to attract EVs through competitive offering strategies. On the other hand, EVs' owners try to choose a cheaper PL for EVs' charging to reduce payment costs. Therefore, the objective of EVs owners can be in conflict with the objective of PLs that provide services for EVs under each VPP. In this regard, the decision-making problem from the VPP's viewpoint should be formulated as a bi-level optimization model, in which in the upper-level, the VPP profit should be maximized and in the lower-level, procurement costs of EVs and other responsive loads should be minimized, simultaneously. To solve the proposed bi-level problem, it is transformed into a traceable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem using duality theory and Karush-Kahn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions. The proposed model is tested on a practical system and several sensitivity analyses are carried out to confirm the capability of the proposed bi-level decision-making framework. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The optimization problems of train timetabling and platforming are two crucial problems in high-speed railway operation; these problems are typically considered sequentially and independently. With the construction of high-speed railways, an increasing number of interactions between trains on multiple lines have led to resource assignment difficulties at hub stations. To coordinate station resources for multiline train timetables, this study fully considered the resources of track segments, station throat areas, and platforms to design a three-part space-time (TPST) framework from a mesoscopic perspective to generate a train timetable and station track assignment simultaneously. A 0-1 integer programming model is proposed, whose objective is to minimize the total weighted train running costs. The construction of a set of incompatible vertexes and links facilitates the expression of difficult constraints. Finally, example results verify the validity and practicability of our proposed method, which can generate conflict-free train timetables with a station track allocation plan for multiple railway lines at the same time.  © 2021 Qin Zhang et al.},

	abstract = {The most commonly used definition of climate smart agriculture (CSA) is provided by the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations, which defines CSA as “agriculture that sustainably increases productivity, enhances resilience, reduces/removes greenhouse gas where possible, and enhances achievement of national food security and development goals”. In this definition, the principal goal of CSA is identified as food security and development, while productivity, adaptation, and mitigation are identified as the three interlinked pillars necessary for achieving this goal. In the context provided by the CSA, soils are seen as a lever to improve the carbon footprint of agriculture, namely through their role as carbon sinks. Improving soils and in particular agricultural soils’ content in soil organic carbon (SOC) in one of the measures enabling to improve the environmental impact of agricultural practices. In this context, composts can be seen as an important feedstock for sustainable farming. To support the development of organic amendment strategies enabling to increase soils’ SOC content, this work proposes a novel methodology to optimize the monthly scheduling of composts and mineral fertilizers amendments. The schedule proposed maximizes soil health - via improved SOC content - while ensuring optimal gross operating surplus from agriculture. This problem is subjected to certain operational, regulatory and soil-dynamics constraints which leads to a complex optimization problem and has to be solved in a relatively short time period for decision-making purposes. This is a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) which is based on a soil-simulation model from which the analytic functions are not explicitly available for the optimization model. Operational and regulatory constraints are explicitly defined and integer and continuous variables are needed in the modeling. In order to effectively solve it in a deterministic way, a novel surrogate-modeling approach for the objective functions and constraints is proposed. Another novelty comes from the implementation of a continuous-variable-reduction procedure in order to build effective surrogates. The optimisation model results obtained from a real case study show that local optimal solutions can be identified with short computation times. The evaluated scenario shows that the optimized strategy could increase by 8% the carbon in soil after 13 years while increasing by 7% the estimated agricultural profit when compared to expert based application schedules. © 2020 China Agricultural University},

However, as the complexity and scale of analytical jobs increase, they encounter a number of unforeseen problems, hotspots with large intermediate data on temporary storage, longer job recov-ery time after failures, and worse query optimizer estimates being examples of issues that we are facing at Microsoft. To address these issues, we propose Phoebe, an efficient learning-based checkpoint optimizer. Given a set of constraints and an objective function at compile-time, Phoebe is able to determine the decomposition of job plans, and the optimal set of checkpoints to preserve their outputs to durable global storage. Phoebe consists of three machine learning predictors and one optimization module. For each stage of a job, Phoebe makes accurate predictions for: (1) the execution time, (2) the output size, and (3) the start/end time taking into account the inter-stage dependencies. Using these predictions, we formulate checkpoint optimization as an integer programming problem and propose a scalable heuristic algorithm that meets the latency requirement of the production environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Phoebe in production work-loads, and show that we can free the temporary storage on hotspots by more than 70% and restart failed jobs 68% faster on average with minimum performance impact. Phoebe also illustrates that adding multiple sets of checkpoints is not cost-efficient, which dramatically reduces the complexity of the optimization. © 2021, VLDB Endowment. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, our goal is to perform joint optimization when scheduling user tasks and assigning RRH to users in a multiple CRAN infrastructure. The joint problem is NP-hard and modeled as a 0/1 integer linear programming (ILP) with the objective of minimizing the total time of executing user tasks and transmitting user output contents under the constraints of RRH linked capacities and BBU pool computing resources. Then, an algorithm is designed by adopting the rounding technology to solve the 0/1 ILP. We will prove its approximation ratio competitively. The conducted simulations further show that the difference between its solution and the optimal one of the 0/1 ILP is very small, and its approximation ratio is between 1.09 and 1.17.

However conventional operational strategies for multi-energy systems, in the existing works, do not consider renewable energy generation plants and CCHP plants as belonging to different interests. To cope with this problem, this article studies a cooperative operation framework model for a Wind-Solar-CCHP Multi-energy system. Instead of the conventional non-cooperative solution-based method, the optimal operation scheduling problem of a multi-energy system is described as an optimization problem of Nash Bargaining. Then the optimization problem of Nash Bargaining for the multi-energy system decomposed into two subproblems: social welfare maximization problem (P1) and energy trading payment problem (P2). The optimal energy transaction profiles can be obtained by solving the P1 problem and the problem of payment of energy trading between PV, WT plant agents and the CCHP plant agent can be obtained by solving the P2 problem. Both problems P1 and P2 can be formulated into mixed-integer linear programming problems and solved by the alternating directional multiplier method. Numerical studies demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed cooperative operation framework and distributed algorithm for solving the two subproblems. Moreover, the bargaining-based cooperative operation method can further induce the multi-energy system to improve the operating profit with the reduced feed-in tariff of distributed generation. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the high penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) with non-uniformly distributed patterns has created unprecedented challenges for regional power systems to maintain system flexibility and reliability. These technical challenges obligate power system operators to curtail part of the produced renewable energy at various scheduling intervals. Motivated by these challenges, grid-connected energy hubs are seen as a way forward to boost system flexibility, decrease the rate of renewable power curtailment, and increase energy efficiency. However, simplified models may significantly affect the performance of the grid-connected energy hubs in practice. Hence, this paper proposes a holistic structure to determine the optimal coordinated operation of the grid-connected energy hubs and the regional power system by relying on the high penetration of wind power. In this regard, various fundamental challenges that have not yet been addressed in an integrated manner, including the CO2 emission rate and the amount of curtailed renewable energy along with total operating costs of the integrated energy system, are among the main objectives of the optimization problem. The proposed structure is developed in the form of tractable mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to handle the day-ahead security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC). The information-gap decision theory (IGDT)-based robust model is used for accurate modeling of wind power uncertainty. The characteristics of the proposed IGDT-based robust SCUC model and its benefits are investigated through several technical case studies conducted on the modified 6-bus and 24-bus test systems. The simulation results validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed structure. According to the obtained results for the 6-bus test system, networked energy hubs can help the system operator to reduce the total operating cost, wind power curtailment cost, and CO2 emission cost by 16.62%, 100%, and 30.44%, respectively, through utilizing up-to-date energy conversion facilities and energy storage systems as well as managing energy demands. It can be seen that the proposed strategy is a very effective step towards achieving a 100% renewable energy system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {A new robust scheduling method for pumping water in a water distribution system under the uncertainty of activating regulation reserves is proposed in this paper. During the operation of power systems, utilizing the energy equipment of the customer to enhance supply-demand control is attracting attention. Because water pumps have been already installed, they can be regarded as a relatively inexpensive, operational, and flexible resource. Changes in the operation of the water pump can contribute to the power supply and demand control. The proposed method helps generate a robust daily schedule for pumping water and provides regulation reserves under the uncertainty of activating regulation reserves. It is based on electric energy prices and regulation reserves, hourly water demand profiles, and the properties of water flow quantity and the electricity consumption of water pumps. This method comprises an optimization model formulated using mixed integer linear programming, validated through simulations of water pumping scheduling under certain scenarios. The results indicate that the net operational cost decreased when water pumps provided regulation reserves; further, the operational feasibility of providing these reserves from water pumps is clarified. The proposed model makes it possible to optimize power system operation that integrates the water supply system. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {With the increasing adoption of electric buses (e-buses), e-bus scheduling problem has become an essential part of transit operation planning. As e-buses have a limited battery capacity, e-bus scheduling problem aims to assign vehicles to timetabled service trips on the bus routes considering their charging demand. Affected by the dynamic operation environment, the travel time and energy consumption of the e-buses often display considerable randomness, resulting in unexpected trip start delays and battery energy shortages. In this paper, we addressed the e-bus scheduling problem under travel time uncertainty by robust optimization approaches. We consider the cardinality constrained uncertainty set to formulate a robust multidepot EVSP model considering trip time uncertainty and partial recharging. The model is developed based on the dynamic programming equations that we formulated for trip chain robustness checking. A branch-and-price (BP) algorithm is devised to generate provably high-quality solutions for large-scale instances. In the BP algorithm, an efficient label setting algorithm is developed to solve the robust resource-constrained shortest path subproblem. Comprehensive numerical experiments are conducted based on the bus routes in Shenzhen to demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested methodology. The robustness of the schedules was evaluated through Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that the trip start delay and battery energy shortage caused by the travel time uncertainty can be effectively reduced at the expense of an increase in the operational cost. A trade-off should be made between the reduction in infeasibility rate and increase in operational cost to choose a proper uncertainty budget. © 2021 Mengyan Jiang et al.},

	abstract = {The rapid global economic development of the world economy depends on the availability of substantial energy and resources, which is why in recent years a large share of non-renewable energy resources has attracted interest in energy control. In addition, inappropriate use of energy resources raises the serious problem of inadequate emissions of greenhouse effect gases, with major impact on the environment and climate. On the other hand, it is important to ensure efficient energy consumption in order to stimulate economic development and preserve the environment. As scheduling conflicts in the different workshops are closely associated with energy consumption. However, we find in the literature only a brief work strictly focused on two directions of research: The scheduling with PM and the scheduling with energy. Moreover, our objective is to combine both aspects and directions of in-depth research in a single machine. In this context, this article addresses the problem of integrated scheduling of production, preventive maintenance (PM) and corrective maintenance (CM) jobs in a single machine. The objective of this article is to minimize total energy consumption under the constraints of system robustness and stability. A common model for the integration of preventive maintenance (PM) in production scheduling is proposed, where the sequence of production tasks, as well as the preventive maintenance (PM) periods and the expected times for completion of the tasks are established simultaneously; this makes the theory put into practice more efficient. On the basis of the exact Branch and Bound method integrated on the CPLEX solver and the genetic algorithm (GA) solved in the Python software, the performance of the proposed integer binary mixed programming model is tested and evaluated. Indeed, after numerically experimenting with various parameters of the problem, the B&B algorithm works relatively satisfactorily and provides accurate results compared to the GA algorithm. A comparative study of the results proved that the model developed was sufficiently efficient. © 2020 Polish Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This work presents an optimization framework based on mixed-integer programming techniques for a smart home’s optimal energy management. In particular, through a cost-minimization objective function, the developed approach determines the optimal day-ahead energy scheduling of all load types that can be either inelastic or can take part in demand response programs and the charging/discharging programs of an electric vehicle and energy storage. The underlying energy system can also interact with the power grid, exchanging electricity through sales and purchases. The smart home’s energy system also incorporates renewable energy sources in the form of wind and solar power, which generate electrical energy that can be either directly consumed for the home’s requirements, directed to the batteries for charging needs (storage, electric vehicles), or sold back to the power grid for acquiring revenues. Three short-term forecasting processes are implemented for real-time prices, photovoltaics, and wind generation. The forecasting model is built on the hybrid combination of the K-medoids algorithm and Elman neural network. K-medoids performs clustering of the training set and is used for input selection. The forecasting is held via the neural network. The results indicate that different renewables’ availability highly influences the optimal demand allocation, renewables-based energy allocation, and the charging–discharging cycle of the energy storage and electric vehicle. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The lack of airport capacity hinders the growth potential of global air travel, inflicting delays and economic losses to passengers, airlines, and airports. Airport Slot Allocation (ASA) is used in congested airports as a short-term measure for providing access to air-carriers to scarce airport resources. A rich literature has been developed during the last decade around the formulation and optimisation of the ASA problem using the IATA World Scheduling Guidelines (IATA WSG). However, existing models do not address airlines’ flight scheduling flexibility preferences which are expressed through the Timing Flexibility Indicator (TFI). Additionally, in considering the airport's capacity, existing ASA literature does not treat endogenously the allocation of the available airport capacity to match the demand's characteristics. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a novel modelling and solution framework that considers airlines’ flexibility preferences and its seamless integration with constraints that enable the dynamic allocation of the airport's resources. Our approach takes into account the number of rejected requests, the total, and maximum displacement objectives and addresses several primary and additional policy criteria of IATA WSG. The preferences of the airlines are introduced through the Timing Flexibility Indicator (TFI) which is incorporated in a weighted objective function considering the number of slot requests which fall within their specified TFI. The proposed framework benefits from valid tightening inequalities which reduce the required computational times. Our computational study using data from a coordinated airport suggests that the joint consideration of the TFI and the endogenous and dynamic capacity constraints, improves airport capacity utilisation, thus leading to improved airport slot schedules with reduced total and maximum displacement and significant improvements in terms of displaced slot requests and passengers. © 2021},

	abstract = {Short-term generation scheduling (STGS) is a fundamental task in the operational planning analysis of hydroelectric plants. For the multi-unit case, the STGS is represented as a large-scale nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear optimization model. Then, considering the (usual) short time for providing a solution, it is vital to exploit all the structural properties of the problem at hand. The main issue for exploiting this problem is the hydro production function (HPF), which is a nonlinear nonconvex relationship between power, head, and turbined outflow of a generating unit (GU). Nevertheless, the HPF usually presents operating regions where the function is convex and regions in which it is concave due to physical reasons. Inspired by sequential convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming techniques, this paper proposes partitioning the domain of the HPF in regions in which it is convex and those in which it is concave. The HPF is approximated by a piecewise linear function using the logarithmic aggregation convex combination (LACC) model in convex regions. In turn, in the concave regions, the HPF is replaced by a convex hull approach, which, combined with symmetry strategies, reduces the number of binary variables in the resulting optimization problem. Using several computational instances of a 50-unit hydroelectric plant, we show that the partitioning-based proposed strategy significantly reduces the computational time compared to two other efficient MILP formulations.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Train timetabling and train platforming are problems of crucial importance when scheduling high-speed trains. Often, these problems are solved separately and in sequence. It is also not uncommon for the problems to be further decomposed by direction since the use of tracks is usually direction specific in a high-speed network. In this paper, we consider the optimization problem of integrating re-timetabling and re-routing decisions within station areas for multiple stations when scheduled maintenance renders the existing, optimized schedules infeasible. We model the underlying problems using a space–time network on a mesoscopic level and propose a 0–1 binary integer programming model that can simultaneously modify the timings and routes of trains from different directions. Two different solution approaches are described. The first is a commonly used Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) approach, while the second utilizes the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) concept. For both methods, a time-dependent dynamic programming approach is used to solve the resulting subproblems. A comparison of the two approaches on instances provided by the Chinese high-speed railway indicates that the ADMM-based approach provides tighter upper bounds and typically requires fewer iterations than the Lagrangian Relaxation approach. Furthermore, the results show that a flexible track utilization policy provides better timetables, with fewer cancellations and less total delay, than a fixed, dedicated direction, track policy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Pareto fronts are determined using the ϵ-constraint and weighted sum methods, and a trade-off point is selected according to a distance criterion. Numerical experiments on both small and large instances show near-optimal results for small instances, and considerably reduced computing times for large ones when using the GA. The results show that a compromise can be found, with a decrease in setup-related waste up to 36% for an increase of inventory of 12%.

	abstract = {DASH is a popular technology for video streaming over the Internet. However, the quality of experience (QoE), a measure of humans’ perceived satisfaction of the quality of these streamed videos, is their subjective opinion, which is difficult to evaluate. Previous studies only considered network-based indices and focused on them to provide smooth video playback instead of improving the true QoE experienced by humans. In this study, we designed a series of click density experiments to verify whether different resolutions could affect the QoE for different video scenes. We observed that, in a single video segment, different scenes with the same resolution could affect the viewer’s QoE differently. It is true that the user’s satisfaction as a result of watching high-resolution video segments is always greater than that when watching low-resolution video segments of the same scenes. However, the most important observation is that low-resolution video segments yield higher viewing QoE gain in slow motion scenes than in fast motion scenes. Thus, the inclusion of more high-resolution segments in the fast motion scenes and more low-resolution segments in the slow motion scenes would be expected to maximize the user’s viewing QoE. In this study, to evaluate the user’s true experience, we convert the viewing QoE into a satisfaction quality score, termed the Q-score, for scenes with different resolutions in each video segment. Additionally, we developed an optimal segment assignment (OSA) algorithm for Q-score optimization in environments characterized by a constrained network bandwidth. Our experimental results show that application of the OSA algorithm to the playback schedule significantly improved users’ viewing satisfaction. © 2021, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja.

	abstract = {The optimization problem for scheduling distributed energy resources (DERs) and battery energy storage systems (BESS) integrated with the power grid is important to minimize energy consumption from conventional sources in response to demand. Conventionally this optimization problem is solved in a centralized manner, limiting the size of the problem that can be solved and creating a high communication overhead because all the data is transferred to the central controller. These limitations are addressed by the proposed distributed consensus-based alternating direction method of multiplier (DC-ADMM) optimization algorithm, which decomposes the optimization problem into subproblems with private cost function and constraints. The distribution feeder is partitioned into low coupling subnetworks/regions, which solves the private subproblem locally and exchanges information with the neighboring regions to reach consensus. The relaxation strategy is employed for mixed-integer and coupled constraints introduced in the optimal power flow (OPF) problem by stationary and transportable BESS because DC-ADMM convergence is only guaranteed for strict convex problems. The information exchange and synchronization between subnetworks/regions are vital for distributed optimization. In this work, both of these aspects are addressed by the blockchain. The smart contract deployed on the blockchain network acts as a mediator for secure data exchange and synchronization in distributed computation. The blockchain-based distributed optimization problem's effectiveness is tested for a 0.5-MW laboratory microgrid for one hour ahead and day-ahead for the IEEE 123-bus and EPRI J1 test feeders, and results are compared with a centralized solution.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Sustainable engineering is very important for logistics systems. Nowadays, sustainable warehouse management is a key factor in market success. Workforce fluctuation and inverting the number of customers’ demands make a lot of problems in distribution warehouses. This study addresses a sustainable approach for the workforce scheduling problem recognized in a real distribution warehouse. The problem arises from the high variability of demand for workers over one workday, which causes workforce surplus in some periods of the workday and shortages in others. Engineering managers of the distribution warehouse already use different full-time and part-time shifts, and schedule workers on different activities, but they still have significant workforce surpluses or shortages in some periods. This study proposes the scheduling of activities’ execution together with workers to face that variability and decrease the cost of the workforce. This idea comes from the fact that some activities in a distribution warehouse can be done in a specific time period after the need for them occurs. In this way, the variability of demand for workers can be decreased, and a lower workforce cost may be ensured. Based on this idea, the entire problem is modeled as integer linear programming. The real example of the problem is solved, and the proposed model is tested on randomly generated instances of the problem in Python by means of the PuLP linear programming package. The results indicate different positive effects in the manner of sustainable warehouse management: lower workforce costs, time savings, better utilization of all types of resources and equipment, increased employee satisfaction, and so on. For even 61% of instances of the introduced problem, the obtained cost of the workforce is lower by more than 20% if activities’ executions are scheduled together with employees. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {We study a stochastic outpatient appointment scheduling problem (SOASP) in which we need to design a schedule and an adaptive rescheduling (i.e., resequencing or declining) policy for a set of patients. Each patient has a known type and associated probability distributions of random service duration and random arrival time. Finding a provably optimal solution to this problem requires solving a multistage stochastic mixed-integer program (MSMIP) with a schedule optimization problem solved at each stage, determining the optimal rescheduling policy over the various random service durations and arrival times. In recognition that this MSMIP is intractable, we first consider a two-stage model (TSM) that relaxes the nonanticipativity constraints of MSMIP and so yields a lower bound. Second, we derive a set of valid inequalities to strengthen and improve the solvability of the TSM formulation. Third, we obtain an upper bound for the MSMIP by solving the TSM under the feasible (and easily implementable) appointment order (AO) policy, which requires that patients are served in the order of their scheduled appointments, independent of their actual arrival times. Fourth, we propose a Monte Carlo approach to evaluate the relative gap between the MSMIP upper and lower bounds. Finally, in a series of numerical experiments, we show that these two bounds are very close in a wide range of SOASP instances, demonstrating the near-optimality of the AO policy. We also identify parameter settings that result in a large gap in between these two bounds. Accordingly, we propose an alternative policy based on neighbor-swapping. We demonstrate that this alternative policy leads to a much tighter upper bound and significantly shrinks the gap. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

Furthermore, the E-depot charging capacity increase achieved through integrating an energy storage system has been studied and discussed.

	abstract = {The maintenance schedule planning of hydro plant generating units is a subject of great interest to several agents in the energy industry. A correct approach for this problem can prevent the degradation of physical assets and minimize the probability of forced shutdowns of their equipment. In addition to these factors, due particularities of the Brazilian system, the operational strategies of its agents are also affected by the maintenance schedule of the generating units. This occurs due to the Availability Factor (AFA), which is directly influenced by the hours of maintenance performed at the plant and, in case of a performance below the stipulated in the concession contracts, it can lead to financial losses or administrative sanctions applied by the regulatory agent. With this motivation in mind, the present work proposes a methodology for Generator Maintenance Scheduling (GMS) of a hydroelectric plant, developing a mathematical model to determine the ideal moment to perform maintenance, considering operational restrictions and regulatory aspects of hydroelectric plants. The optimization methodology proposed for this problem is done through mixed-integer linear programming, where the integer variables consist of the operating state and start date of maintenance of each generating unit. In the end, to validate the proposed modeling, a case study is carried out for a real large plant in the Brazilian system. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {An integrated energy system (IES) shows great potential in reducing the terminal energy supply cost and improving energy efficiency, but the operation scheduling of an IES, especially integrated with inter-connected multiple energy stations, is rather complex since it is affected by various factors. Toward a comprehensive operation scheduling of multiple energy stations, in this paper, a day-ahead and intra-day collaborative operation model is proposed. The targeted IES consists of electricity, gas, and thermal systems. First, the energy flow and equipment composition of the IES are analyzed, and a detailed operation model of combined equipment and networks is established. Then, with the objective of minimizing the total expected operation cost, a robust optimization of day-ahead and intra-day scheduling for energy stations is constructed subject to equipment operation constraints, network constraints, and so on. The day-ahead operation provides start-up and shut-down scheduling of units, and in the operating day, the intra-day rolling operation optimizes the power output of equipment and demand response with newly evolved forecasting information. The photovoltaic (PV) uncertainty and electric load demand response are also incorporated into the optimization model. Eventually, with the piecewise linearization method, the formulated optimization model is converted to a mixed-integer linear programming model, which can be solved using off-the-shelf solvers. A case study on an IES with five energy stations verifies the effectiveness of the proposed day-ahead and intra-day collaborative robust operation strategy. © 2021 by the authors.

Recent demonstrations by the Chinese spacecraft Micius have spurred an international space race and enormous interest in the development of both scientific and commercial systems. Research efforts so far have concentrated upon in-orbit demonstrations involving a single satellite and one or two ground stations. Ultimately satellite quantum key distribution should enable secure network communication between multiple nodes, which requires efficient scheduling of communication with the set of ground stations. Here we present a study of how satellite quantum key distribution can service many ground stations taking into account realistic constraints such as geography, operational hours, and most importantly, weather conditions. The objective is to maximise the number of keys a set of ground stations located in the United Kingdom could share while simultaneously reflecting the communication needs of each node and its relevance in the network. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear optimisation program and solved to a desired optimality gap using a state of the art solver. The approach is presented using a simulation run throughout six years to investigate the total number of keys that can be sent to ground stations. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This work is about mission planning in teams of mobile autonomous agents. We consider tasks that are spatially distributed, non-atomic, and provide an utility for integral and also partial task completion. Agents are heterogeneous, therefore showing different efficiency when dealing with the tasks. The goal is to define a system-level plan that assigns tasks to agents to maximize mission performance. We define the mission planning problem through a model including multiple sub-problems that are addressed jointly: task selection and allocation, task scheduling, task routing, control of agent proximity over time. The problem is proven to be NP-hard and is formalized as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). Two solution approaches are proposed: one heuristic and one exact method. Both combine a generic MILP solver and a genetic algorithm, resulting in efficient anytime algorithms. To support performance scalability and to allow the effective use of the model when online continual replanning is required, a decentralized and fully distributed architecture is defined top-down from the MILP model. Decentralization drastically reduces computational requirements and shows good scalability at the expenses of only moderate losses in performance. Lastly, we illustrate the application of the mission planning framework in two demonstrators. These implementations show how the framework can be successfully integrated with different platforms, including mobile robots (ground and aerial), wearable computers, and smart-phone devices.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a general operational planning framework for controllable generators, one day ahead, under uncertain re-newable energy generation. The effect of photovoltaic (PV) power generation uncertainty on operating decisions is examined by incorporating expected possible uncertainties into a two-stage unit commitment optimization. The planning objective consists in minimizing operating costs and/or equivalent carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Based on distributions of forecasting errors of the net demand, a LOLP-based risk assessment method is proposed to determine an appropriate amount of operating reserve (OR) for each time step of the next day. Then, in a first stage, a deterministic optimization within a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) method generates the unit commitment of controllable generators with the day-ahead PV and load demand prediction and the prescribed OR requirement. In a second stage, possible future forecasting uncertainties are considered. Hence, a stochastic operational planning is optimized in order to commit enough flexible generators to handle unexpected deviations from predic-tions. The proposed methodology is implemented for a local energy community. Results regarding the available operating reserve, operating costs and CO2 emissions are established and compared. About 15% of economic operating costs and environmental costs are saved, compared to a deterministic generation planning while ensuring the targeted security level.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Autonomous vehicles have the potential to transform the way people are transported. While driverless technology may mean fewer vehicles are required to transport people to and from their daily activities, such changes may result in increased congestion or total miles traveled. In this study, we solve the single-household shared autonomous vehicle problem to identify cost-optimal routings of vehicles throughout the day. Such a tool will be useful for consumers seeking to minimize cost and for regulators seeking to understand and predict how people may behave in different scenarios. We provide a thorough literature review and construct a mixed-integer linear program to minimize the daily travel cost of a household attending a given set of activities. Since solution time is a determinant for applicability of such a model, we present the model in a component-wise fashion. This approach allows us to understand which features most affect the problem complexity and solution time. We note that modeling carpooling is the feature that most increases time to find an optimal solution, and we therefore propose a novel modeling technique for carpooling two people. We illustrate the performance of our model by comparing it with other models from the literature and note that our model can solve significantly larger problem instances and in a time that is short enough to facilitate real-time scheduling. We also highlight the utility of our model for regulators, who can use it to analyze quickly produced optimal routes under different cost/tax scenarios. © 2020},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is becoming a profitable technology because of it offers cost-effective IT solutions globally. A well-designed task scheduling algorithm ensures the optimal utilization of clouds resources and reducing execution time dynamically. This research article deals with the task scheduling of inter-dependent subtasks on unrelated parallel computing machines in a cloud computing environment. This article considers two variants of the problem-based on two different objective function values. The first variant considers the minimization of the total completion time objective function while the second variant considers the minimization of the makespan objective function. Heuristic and meta-heuristic (HEART) based algorithms are proposed to solve the task scheduling problems. These algorithms utilize the property of list scheduling algorithm of unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation has been provided for the two variants of the problem. The optimal solution is obtained by solving MILP formulation using A Mathematical Programming Language (AMPL) software. Extensive numerical experiments have been performed to evaluate the performance of proposed algorithms. The solutions obtained by the proposed algorithms are found to out-perform the existing algorithms.

	abstract = {Priority-based scheduling strategies are often used to resolve contentions in resource constrained control systems. Such scheduling strategies inevitably introduce time delays into controls and may degrade the performance of control systems. Considering the coupling between priority assignment and control, this paper presents a method to co-design priority assignments and control laws for each control system, which aims to minimize the overall performance degradation caused by contentions. The co-design problem is formulated as a mixed integer optimization problem with a very large search space, rendering difficulty in computing the optimal solution. To solve the problem, we develop a novel contention-resolving model predictive control method to dynamically assign priorities and compute an optimal control. The priority assignment can be determined using a sample-based approach without excessive demand on computing resources, and optimal controls can be computed iteratively following the order of the assigned priorities. We apply the proposed contention-resolving model predictive control to co-design scheduling and controls in networked control systems. We present simulation results to show the effectiveness of our proposed method. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

To maximize the spectrum efficiency for the fifth generation (5G) mobile networks, frequency reuse-1 is employed. Thus, advanced inter-cell interference coordination techniques are required to mitigate the inter-cell interference for 5G HetNets. In this paper, the energy efficient optimization problem based on coordinated scheduling is formulated, which is a mixed-integer nonlinear fractional programming problem and is intractable to solve directly. To tackle this, a two-step GA based scheme is proposed to solve the optimization problem. In the first step, the resource blocks matrix is solved by normal GA in the spectral efficiency aspect with fixed power distribution matrix, and then the power distribution matrix is obtained in the second step by non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) with obtained resource blocks allocation matrix. Finally, the system level numerical evaluation process is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed scheme. © 2013 IEEE.},

This problem, as a major part of supply chain planning, includes the finding of a suitable factory for each job and the scheduling of the assigned jobs at each factory, simultaneously. For the first time, this paper studies multi-objective scheduling in the production network in which each factory has its customers and demands can be satisfied by itself or other factories. In other words, this paper assumes that jobs can transfer from the overloaded machine in the origin factory to the factory, which has fewer workloads by imposing some transportation times. For simultaneous minimization of the sum of the earliness and tardiness of jobs and total completion time, after modeling the scheduling problem as a mixed-integer linear program, the existing multi-objective techniques are analyzed and a new one is applied to our problem. Since this problem is NP-hard, a heuristic algorithm is also proposed to generate a set of Pareto optimal solutions. Also, the algorithms are proposed to improve and cover the Pareto front.

In recent years, with a growing concern about the energy saving and environmental impact, energy oriented scheduling is going to be a hot issue for sustainable manufacturing. In this study, we investigate an energy-oriented scheduling problem deriving from the hybrid flow shop with unrelated parallel machine. First, we formulate the scheduling problem with a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, which considers two objectives including minimizing the completion time and energy consumption. Second, a hybrid multi-objective teaching-learning based optimization (HMOTLBO) algorithm based on decomposition is proposed. In the proposed HMOTLBO, a new solution presentation and five decoding rules are designed for mining the optimal solution. To reduce the standby energy consumption and turning on/off energy consumption, a greedy shifting algorithm is developed without changing the completion time of a scheduling. To improve the converge speed of the algorithm, a weight matching strategy is designed to avoid randomly matching weight vectors with students. To enhance the exploration and exploitation capacities of the algorithm, A teaching operator based on crossover and a self-learning operator based on a variable neighborhood search(VNS) are proposed. Finally, fourth different experiments are performed on 15 cases, the comparison result verified the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed algorithm.  © 2013 IEEE.},

In the modeling of such systems with seasonal storage capability, the two main challenges include the low temporal resolution of available data and the non-linear cost versus capacity relationship of solar thermal and heat storage technologies. This work overcomes these challenges by developing two different optimization models based on mixed-integer linear programming with objectives to minimize the total energy costs and carbon dioxide emissions. Piecewise affine functions are used to approximate the non-linear cost versus capacity behavior. The developed methods are applied to the optimal planning of a case study in Austria. The results of the models are compared based on the accuracy and real-time performance together with the impact of piecewise affine cost functions versus non-piecewise affine fixed cost functions. The results show that the investment decisions of both models are in good agreement with each other while the computational time for the 8760-h based model is significantly greater than the model having three representative periods. The models with piecewise affine cost functions show larger capacities of technologies than non-piecewise affine fixed cost function based models. © 2020 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Due to the rapid growth of transportation demand for economic development, the importance of effective urban traffic signal control can never be underestimated, and the severe space saturation greatly limit the operations of a transportation system. In this paper, public buses and other vehicles are treated as different traffic flows. We address the urban traffic signal control problem in a scheduling framework by considering that the capacity of a public bus is much greater than that of other vehicles. The dynamics of an urban traffic network controlled by traffic lights are described by a novel model, which is formed by inserting mixed logical constraints into a cell transmission flow dynamic model. It includes the nonlinear relationship among the current link volume from the upstream, the current remaining link capacity from the downstream, and the state of the traffic lights. With the objective of minimizing the total delay time in a traffic network for people in the private vehicles and buses, we obtain a mixed integer linear programming formulation, which is built from the traffic signal control problem. We further analyze the influence of the number of passengers on buses and the time interval. The efficiency of the proposed method is verified by making comparisons between the models with and without considering the public transport regular. When the average number of passengers on a bus increases from 10 to 60, the degree of optimization ranges from 17% to 51% for the two-stage model and from 4% to 26% for the four-stage model. Finally, we consider the case without bus lanes and show the importance of dedicated bus lanes. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The tactical, technical, and economic considerations are critical factors in evaluating crop rotation decisions in any agricultural system. This system suffers from uncertainties that are amplified during the multi-period rotation planning. This study considers the crop rotation problem with water supply/demand and net return uncertainties, which vary within the allowable rotation cycle. Robust optimization is the most relevant tool for elaborating uncertainty in different parameters related to agricultural activities. It makes the formulated model numerically tractable, primarily when implemented in complex agricultural problems. The main objectives of this work include deciding the optimal cropping plans, achieving a reasonable income for the farmer, and taking water uncertainties into account on a tactical basis. All the mentioned goals are integrated while respecting the agronomic constraints and satisfying specific demand. A powerful feature of robust optimization is its robustness level adjustment for the solution against uncertainty sets. In this situation, the relationships between optimal values, the budget of uncertainty, and the perturbation values were outlined with insights towards tradeoff decisions. The proposed model compares the performance at each perturbation level with insights toward proper managerial decisions.  © 2013 IEEE.},

We introduce a unified modeling framework in which different types of semi-cyclic discrete-event systems can be described by switching max-plus linear (SMPL) models. We use a dynamic graph to visualize the evolution of an SMPL system over a certain period in a graphical way and to describe the order relations of the system events. We show that the dynamic graph can be used to analyse the structural properties of the system. In general the model predictive scheduling design problem for SMPL systems can be recast as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. In order to reduce the number of optimization parameters we introduce a novel reparametrization of the MILP problem. This may lead to a decrease in computational complexity. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {For an effective and reliable power system, determining the optimal state of the accessible producing units is the key step, which comprises of two segments; making decision in committing the generators (unit commitment) followed by the decision-making of their active power allocation (economic dispatch). Unit commitment (UC) problem is a mixed-integer bit transition-state optimization problem to which classical optimizing tools strive to evaluate, whereas metaheuristic methods prove to be a healthy attempt. In this study, a binary model of the polar bear optimization (BPBO) algorithm is developed and is utilized to solve this combinatorial problem. Polar bear optimization (PBO) is a newly developed swarm-based approach, simulating three mechanisms in one technique in the form of effectual exploration and exploitation phase along with dynamic control of population size. BPBO uses a modified sigmoid conversion function to produce the state bits (ON/OFF) of the units. These three potent procedures help in determining the optimal transition state of units by varying the size of the search agents. For solving the economic dispatch problem (EDP), the conventional lambda iteration method is used. Repairing of the infeasible bit is also carried out by applying heuristic adjustments. To illustrate the vitality of the BPBO, it is modeled in “MATLAB 2016a” and tested on IEEE 4, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100-unit test systems. Comparative evaluation in terms of optimum combinations, active power allocation, and simulation time with other available methodologies is also done, resulting in a progressive approach with superiority to other recent methods. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {The growing demand for green energy has driven the development of large-capacity hydroelectric plants away from load centers. In this setting, one key aspect is constructing electrical networks for efficient power transmission to the primary grid, which is sometimes combined with high-voltage direct-current systems. However, on-site applications based on real-time dispatch problems often do not model AC power flow (ACPF) constraints, partly because of a lack of appealing methods to simultaneously include the dispatch and ACPF operating characteristics. Furthermore, a precise hydropower production function, a priority in this type of problem, can introduce additional complexity, and practical applications commonly sacrifice grid-connection modeling. This paper proposes a technique for incorporating ACPF constraints in real-time hydro dispatch, promoting widespread methods and optimization tools. The proposed strategy is based on mixed-integer quadratic programming that yields convergent electrical variables compatible with the exact ACPF to minimize a compromise between transmission losses and turbined outflow. The testbed is the Santo Antônio system, composed of 50 generating units, 13 power transformers, and 41 buses. Simulations based on real-life data demonstrate the impact of ACPF modeling, achieving consistently reduced losses above 5%, at the cost of a higher processing time.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The current energy strategy of the European Union puts the end-user as a key participant in electricity markets. The creation of energy communities has been encouraged by the European Union to increase the penetration of renewable energy and reduce the overall cost of the energy chain. Energy communities are mostly composed of prosumers, which may be households with small-size energy production equipment such as rooftop photovoltaic panels. The local electricity market is an emerging concept that enables the active participation of end-user in the electricity markets and is especially interesting when energy communities are in place. This paper proposes an optimization model to schedule peer-to-peer transactions via local electricity market, grid transactions in retail market, and battery management considering the photovoltaic production of households. Prosumers have the possibility of transacting energy with the retailer or with other consumers in their community. The problem is modeled using mixed-integer linear programming, containing binary and continuous variables. Four scenarios are studied, and the impact of battery storage systems and peer-to-peer transactions is analyzed. The proposed model execution time according to the number of prosumers involved (3, 5, 10, 15, or 20) in the optimization is analyzed. The results suggest that using a battery storage system in the energy community can lead to energy savings of 11-13%. Besides, combining the use of peer-to-peer transactions and energy storage systems can potentially provide energy savings of up to 25% in the overall costs of the community members. © 2013 IEEE.},

The solution combines (1) a lower-level regulation capacity reset strategy that identifies the available regulation capacity for each hour, and (2) an upper-level zone temperature scheduling algorithm to find the optimal load trajectory with a minimum net electricity cost. In the supervisory scheduling strategy, piece-wise linear approximations of representative air-conditioning equipment behaviors, derived from an offline analysis of the capacity reset mechanism, are used to predict the cooling power and regulation capacity; and a mixed-integer convex program is formulated and solved to determine the optimal control actions. In order to evaluate the performance of the developed control solution, two baseline strategies are considered, one with a conventional night setup/back control and the other utilizing an optimization procedure for minimizing the energy cost only. Five-day simulation tests were carried out for the various control strategies. Compared to the baseline night setup/back strategy, the energy-priority controller led to a 26% lower regulation credit and consequentially caused a net cost increase of 2%; the proposed bi-market control solution was able to increase the regulation credit by 118% and reduce the net electricity cost by 14%. © 2021 by the author.

	abstract = {Relay nodes are used to improve the throughput, delay and reliability performance of energy harvesting networks by assisting both energy and information transfer between sources and access point. Previous studies on radio frequency energy harvesting networks are limited to single-source-single/multiple-relay networks. In this paper, a novel joint relay selection, scheduling and power control problem for multiple-source-multiple-relay network is formulated with the objective of minimizing the total duration of wireless power and information transfer. The formulated problem is non-convex mixed-integer non-linear programming problem, and proven to be NP-hard. We first formulate a sub-problem on scheduling and power control for a given relay selection. We propose an efficient optimal algorithm based on a bi-level optimization over power transfer time allocation. Then, for optimal relay selection, we present optimal exponential-time Branch-and-Bound (BB) based algorithm where the nodes are pruned with problem specific lower and upper bounds. We also provide two BB-based heuristic approaches limiting the number of branches generated from a BB-node, and a relay criterion based lower complexity heuristic algorithm. The proposed algorithms are demonstrated to outperform conventional harvest-then-cooperate approaches with up to 87% lower schedule length for various network settings with at least 7.88 times higher algorithm runtime. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {High integration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES), predominantly wind power, has created complexities in power system operations. In addition, large fleets of Electric Vehicles (EVs) increase the uncertainty on electricity consumption significantly. Thus, an uncoordinated charging process will further complicate the grid scheduling. In this work, we propose a coordinated scheduling algorithm for charge/discharge of aggregated EV fleets to maximize the integration of wind generation and minimize the charging cost for EV owners in a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) setup. Challenges for people participation in V2G, such as battery degradation and insecurity about unexpected events, are also addressed. The real-time charge/discharge scheduling problem is formulated as a multi-objective mixed-integer quadratic programming problem that the aggregator takes advantage of real-time communication in smart grid to frequently update the EV schedule with updated real-time information about EV availabilities, wind generation forecast, and electricity price. Simulations demonstrate significant increase in wind utilization and reduction in charging cost and battery degradation compared to the uncontrolled charging scenario. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In open-pit mines, the long-term production scheduling problem is a mixed-integer programming optimization problem. Usually, it is tricky to reach the true optimal solution to the long-term production scheduling problem due to its complexity and dimensions. However, owing to its high-dimensional and combinatorial nature, the long-term production scheduling problem hinders the development of a precise mathematical optimization technique that can solve the whole problem for any real-size block model. In this paper, a hybrid model is introduced to solve the long-term production scheduling problem, taking into account grade uncertainty assisted by the augmented Lagrangian relaxation and the grey wolf optimizer methods. The hybrid augmented Lagrangian relaxation–the grey wolf optimizer technique is recommended to solve the long-term production scheduling problem to improve its performance and, consequently, speed up the convergence. The proposed model has been compared with the results of the hybrid methods gained from the classic Lagrangian relaxation and augmented Lagrangian relaxation methods integrated with the bat algorithm, particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm, the traditional subgradient method, and conventional method without using the Lagrangian approach. The fallouts point out that better presentation is gained by the augmented Lagrangian relaxation–the grey wolf optimizer method in terms of net present value, average ore grade, and CPU time. Moreover, the cumulative net present value by the proposed model is 13.39% more than the conventional method. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

In order to determine the workforce size and mix accurately, we integrate the multi-project scheduling problem and personnel staffing problem. We construct a baseline personnel roster that takes the personnel scheduling constraints into account and model the workload stemming from the project activities as an endogenous variable in the model. In order to decrease the overall staffing budget, we consider the sharing of resources, i.e. personnel resources can be transferred between projects. In the problem under study, we consider unproductive resource transfer times and different restrictions related to the sharing of resources imposed on the schedule of individual workers, which is often neglected in the literature. We propose a multi-stage solution procedure that exploits the optimal linear programming solution, obtained via column generation, to find a high-quality integer solution based on a diving heuristic. In order to improve the computational performance, different speed-up mechanisms are included relying on a state space reduction. Detailed computational experiments are presented to evaluate and benchmark different alternative optimisation strategies.

	abstract = {Unexpected disruptions occur in the railways on a daily basis, which are typically handled manually by experienced traffic controllers with the support of predefined contingency plans. When several disruptions occur simultaneously, it is rather hard for traffic controllers to make rescheduling decisions, because (1) the predefined contingency plans corresponding to these disruptions may conflict with each other and (2) no predefined contingency plan considering the combined effects of multiple disruptions is available. This paper proposes a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to reschedule the timetable in case of multiple disruptions that occur at different geographic locations but have overlapping periods and are pairwise connected by at least one train line. The dispatching measures of retiming, reordering, cancelling, adding stops and flexible short-turning are formulated in the MILP model that also considers the rolling stock circulations at terminal stations and platform capacity. We develop two approaches for rescheduling the timetable in a dynamic environment: the sequential approach and the combined approach. In the sequential approach, a single-disruption rescheduling model is applied to handle each new disruption with the last solution as reference. In the combined approach, the multiple-disruption rescheduling model is applied every time an extra disruption occurs by considering all ongoing disruptions. A rolling-horizon solution method to the multiple-disruption model has been developed to handle long multiple connected disruptions in a more efficient way. The sequential and combined approaches have been tested on real-life instances on a subnetwork of the Dutch railways with 38 stations and 10 train lines operating half-hourly in each direction. In a few cases, the sequential approach did not find feasible solutions, while the combined approach obtained the solutions for all considered cases. Besides, the combined approach was able to find solutions with less cancelled train services and/or train delays than the sequential approach. For long disruptions, the proposed rolling-horizon method was able to generate high-quality rescheduling solutions in an acceptable time. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The processing time and due date of each job are known in advance. In the order accepting scheduling problem, jobs are allowed to be rejected. The objective of the problem is to maximize the net revenue while keeping the weighted number of tardy jobs for the second agent within a predetermined value. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation is provided to obtain the optimal solution. The problem is considered as an NP-hard problem. Therefore, MILP can be used to solve small problem instances optimally. To solve the problem instances with realistic size, heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms have been proposed. A heuristic method is used to determine and secure a quick solution while the metaheuristic based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is designed to obtain the near-optimal solution. A numerical experiment is piloted and conducted on the benchmark instances that could be obtained from the literature. The performances of the proposed algorithms are tested through numerical experiments. The proposed PSO can obtain the solution within 0.1% of the optimal solution for problem instances up to 60 jobs. The performance of the proposed PSO is found to be significantly better than the performance of the heuristic.  © 2021 Jiaji Li et al.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is a widely adopted platform for executing tasks of different application types that belong to the end users. In the cloud, application task is prone to failure for several reasons, such as software bug or exception, virtual or physical infrastructure failure. Cloud service providers are responsible for managing availability of scheduled computing tasks in order to provide high level QoS for their customers. Protecting task against failure is a challenging and not a trivial mission due to dynamic, heterogeneous and large distributed structure of the cloud environment. The existing works in the literature focus on task failure prediction and neglect the remedy (post) actions. In this work, we first study and analyze three publicly available large cluster datasets from Google, Alibaba, and Trinity, to characterize task failure in cloud computing platform. We then propose a failure-aware task scheduling framework that can predict the termination status for a set of given tasks during the runtime, and take the appropriate remedy actions. The framework uses deep learning methods named Artificial and Convolutional Neural Network, ANN and CNN, for different prediction purposes. In addition, we formalize the actions selection problem as Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model and propose a heuristic optimization solution that aims to minimize the failure probability of tasks and their resources usage. The results show ANN and CNN can achieve prediction accuracy of up to 94% and 92%, respectively using Google dataset. Moreover, the framework can protect up to 40% of tasks that are predicted as failed using Alibaba dataset by taking the appropriate remedy actions, and hence save many of cluster's resources such as CPU and RAM. © 2013 IEEE.},

Manual generated timetables might hold some errors and consume a long time to create feasible solutions. Thus, there is a need to find optimal and fast solutions for this problem. The difficulty of the timetabling problem is further increased when tackling faculty-related constraints, according to their requirements, preferences, and availability. Thus, student-related constraints are usually the focus of UCTP generated solutions, in which faculty constraints are limited to their teaching load or preferences. This paper proposes a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model for a preregistration UCTP, combined with faculty-related constraints. The goal is to maximize events assignments and faculty-members preferences satisfaction while balancing the university requirements. At the same time, student learning days and unassigned events are minimized. The model is tested with eight real-world instances. Computational experiments are carried out to show the efficiency of the model.

The problem at hand is to optimize the UAV's data collection points, and the set of transmitting devices at each point. We outline three contributions. The first is an Integer Linear Program (ILP), which can be used to compute the optimal trajectory and data transmission schedule. Second, we propose a novel heuristic called Iteratively Construct Link Schedule and Trajectory (ICLST) that includes a link set/schedule selection policy called Highest Sum-Rate Selection (HSRS). Third, we propose a novel learning-based protocol that enables a UAV to independently learn the optimal trajectory with the highest energy efficiency. Our results show that a SIC radio helps double the amount of data collected by the UAV. Placing devices at different heights helps the UAV collect more data. Moreover, ICLST with HSRS is capable of producing a schedule that is near optimal. Additionally, our learning protocol yields a schedule with the highest energy-efficiency. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The dramatic increase in medical waste has put a severe strain on sorting operations. Traditional manual order picking is extremely susceptible to infection spread among workers and picking errors, while automated medical waste sorting systems can handle large volumes of medical waste efficiently and reliably. This paper investigates the optimization problem in the automated medical waste sorting system by considering the operational flow of medical waste. For this purpose, a mixed-integer programming model is developed to optimize the assignment among medical waste, presorting stations, and AGVs. An effective variable neighborhood search based on dynamic programming algorithm is proposed, and extensive numerical experiments are conducted. It is found that the proposed algorithm can efficiently solve the optimization problem, and the sensitivity analysis gives recommendations for the speed setting of the conveyor.  © 2021 Xueting He et al.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based predictive control scheme for reducing the energy consumption and energy cost of pumping systems in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), in which the pumps are operated in a binary mode, using on/off signals. As global energy consumption increases, the efficient operation of energy-intensive facilities has also become important. A WWTP in Busan, Republic of Korea is used as the target of this study. This WWTP is a large energy-consuming facility, and the pumping station accounts for a significant portion of the energy consumption of the WWTP. The framework of the proposed scheme consists of a deep neural network (DNN) model for forecasting wastewater inflow and a DRL agent for controlling the on/off signals of the pumping system, where proximal policy optimization (PPO) and deep Q-neural network (DQN) are employed as the DRL agents. To implement smart control with DRL, a reward function is designed to consider the energy consumption amount and electricity price information. In particular, new features and penalty factors for pump switching, which are essential for preventing pump wear, are also considered. The performance of our designed DRL agents is compared with those of WWTP experts and conventional approaches such as scheduling method and model predictive control (MPC), in which integer linear programming (ILP) optimization is employed. Results show that the designed agents outperform the other approaches in terms of compliance with operating rules and reducing energy costs.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Stirling units are a viable option for micro-cogeneration applications, but they operate often with multiple daily startups and shutdowns due to the variability of load profiles. This work focused on the experimental and numerical study of a small-size commercial Stirling unit when subjected to cycling operations. First, experimental data about energy flows and emissions were collected during on-off operations. Second, these data were utilized to tune an in-house code for the economic optimization of cogeneration plant scheduling. Lastly, the tuned code was applied to a case study of a residential flat in Northern Italy during a typical winter day to investigate the optimal scheduling of the Stirling unit equipped with a thermal storage tank of diverse sizes. Experimentally, the Stirling unit showed an integrated electric efficiency of 8.9% (8.0%) and thermal efficiency of 91.0% (82.2%), referred to as the fuel lower and, between parenthesis, higher heating value during the on-off cycling test, while emissions showed peaks in NOx and CO up to 100 ppm but shorter than a minute. Numerically, predictions indicated that considering the on-off effects, the optimized operating strategy led to a great reduction of daily startups, with a number lower than 10 per day due to an optimal thermal storage size of 4 kWh. Ultimately, the primary energy saving was 12% and the daily operational cost was 2.9 €/day. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

	abstract = {Backscatter communication which enables wireless-powered backscatter devices (BDs) to transmit information by reflecting incident signals, is an energy- and cost-efficient communication technology for Internet-of-Things. This paper considers an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted backscatter communication network (UBCN) consisting of multiple BDs and carrier emitters (CEs) on the ground as well as a UAV. A communicate-while-fly scheme is first designed, in which the BDs illuminated by their associated CEs transmit information to the flying UAV in a time-division-multiple-access manner. Considering the critical issue of the UAV's limited on-board energy and the CEs' transmission energy, we maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the UBCN by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory, the BDs' scheduling, and the CEs' transmission power, subject to the BDs' throughput constraints and harvested energy constraints, as well as other practical constraints. Furthermore, we propose an iterative algorithm based on the block coordinated decent method to solve the formulated mixed-integer non-convex problem, in each iteration of which the variables are alternatively optimized by leveraging the cutting-plane technique, the Dinkelbach's method and the successive convex approximation technique. Also, the convergence and complexity of the proposed algorithm are analyzed. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed communicate-while-fly scheme achieves significant EE gains compared with the hover-and-fly scheme, the state-of-the-art scheme, and the CE-relay scheme. Useful insights on the optimal trajectory design and resource allocation are also obtained. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

From another point of view, the high cost of Quay Cranes (QCs) is a motivation for solving a set of real-world problems including Quay Crane Assignment Problem (QCAP) and the Quay Crane Scheduling Problem (QCSP) in the hotspot of research. The main innovation of this proposal is to integrate both QCAP and QCSP to improve the performance of QC with emphasis on optimization, i.e., QCASP. A real case study in Iran was applied to validate the proposed problem which was formulated by a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Due to the inherent complexity of the problem proposed in the real-world cases, the Teaching-Learning-Based-Optimization (TLBO) algorithm was used to nd an optimal/global solution in a reasonable span of time. The applied TLBO was tuned by Taguchi method and validated in small instances in comparison with an exact method. The computational results showed that our proposed TLBO algorithm could solve Quay Crane Assignment and Scheduling Problem (QCASP), especially in large-size instances, successfully. Finally, some managerial implications are recommended to consider the bene ts of the proposed methodology and the high-ethciency of the algorithm regarding the real case study presented. © 2021 Sharif University of Technology.

The proposed solution aims to minimize the electricity-cost as well as traditional objectives: number of used vehicles and total travel distance. In particular, the proposed solution cleverly shifts battery charging to off-peak periods and adjusts the charging duration in order to reduce costs. First, the problem is carefully carved in a mixed integer linear programming model. Second, a constraint programming model is built. Third, a combined model is constructed to exploit the strengths of both models. The computational study based on the well-known benchmarking test instances demonstrates we can reduce the electricity cost by 3.1% on average while not compromising other objectives.

	abstract = {The Energy-efficiency of demand management technologies and customer’s experience have emerged as important issues as consumers began to heavily adopt these technologies. In this context, where the electrical load imposed on the smart grid by residential users needs to be opti-mized, it can be better managed when customer’s comfort parameters are used, such as thermal comfort and preferred appliance usage time interval. In this paper a multi-layer architecture is proposed that uses a multi-objective optimization model at the energy consumption level to take consumer comfort and experience into consideration. The paper shows how our proposed Clustered Sequential Management (CSM) approach could improve consumer comfort via appliance use sched-uling. To quantify thermal comfort, we use thermodynamic solutions for a Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioner (HVAC) system and then apply our scheduling model to find the best time slot for such thermal loads, linking consumer experience to power consumption. In addition to thermal loads, we also include non-thermal loads in the cost minimization and the enhanced consumer ex-perience. In this hierarchal algorithm, we classified appliances by their load profile including de-grees of freedom for consumer appliance prioritization. Finally, we scheduled consumption within a Time of Use (ToU) pricing model. In this model, we used Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Linear Programming (LP) optimization for different categories with different constraints for various loads. We eliminate the customer’s inconvenience on thermal load considering ASHRAE standard, increase the satisfaction on EV optimal chagrining constrained by minimum cost and achieve the preferred usage time for the non-interruptible deferrable loads.

The performance measure adopted is the makespan minimization. The existence of sequence-dependent setup times makes this problem to be NP-hard. Furthermore, the solution encoding usually employed for other variants of the customer order scheduling problem does not guarantee finding optimal solutions. For this problem, we present some properties and develop two Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations to analyze the structure of the solutions. Using these properties and models, we propose two matheuristics based on fixing some integer decision variables in the MILP models, denoted as Fixed Variable List Algorithm (FVLA) and Clustering Sequence Algorithm (CSA), respectively. The computational experiments carried out prove the ability of these matheuristics to find high-quality solutions in reasonable CPU time. More specifically, the FVLA matheuristic stands out as the most efficient for the problem. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Increasing energy efficiency in water distribution systems is one of the most important aspects of a sustainable water infrastructure. Additionally, providing this energy from renewable sources is an essential step towards a cleaner production in energy infrastructures. Therefore in this paper, an optimization model is developed to minimize the energy consumption of a water-energy microgrid system. A day-ahead economic dispatch model is developed to minimize the daily cost of energy in the water-energy microgrid. The energy consumption of water system is minimized using tank's and pump's scheduling and operation, hydraulic factors, and daily demand. Particularly, the electricity consumption of the pump is minimized by adjusting its head gain and flow rate via a variable speed. The energy unit is composed of an aggregated conventional power generation, solar photovoltaic, wind generation, and battery energy storage system. To offer a global optimum for the proposed non-linear programming formulation, bivariate piecewise linear approximation is used to linearize the pump's power consumption and gain, and conservation of energy-mass. In addition, univariate piecewise linear approximation is used to linearize the energy consumption function of conventional power generation systems. The optimization results of the mixed integer linear programming and mixed integer non-linear programming formulations for the studied water-energy microgrid system are compared and discussed. These models are developed to concurrently minimize the electricity consumption of a micro water-energy distribution network in two scenarios of (1) standalone water distribution system operation and (2) an integrated islanded micro water-energy system with electrical loads. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The proposed stochastic optimization formulation considers geological uncertainty in addition to uncertainty related to equipment performances and truck cycle times. The method is applied at a real-world mining complex, stressing the benefits of optimizing the short-term production schedule and fleet management simultaneously. Compared to a conventional two-step approach, where the production schedule is optimized first before optimizing the allocation of the mining fleet, the costs generated by shovel movements are reduced by 56% and lost production due to shovel relocation is cut by 54%. Furthermore, the required number of trucks shows a more balanced profile, reducing total truck operational costs by 3.1% over an annual planning horizon, as well as the required haulage capacity in the most haulage-intense periods by 25%.

	abstract = {In this paper, a new framework for optimizing the resource allocation in a millimeter-wave-non-orthogonal multiple access (mmWave-NOMA) communication for crowded venues is proposed. MmWave communications suffer from severe blockage caused by obstacles such as the human body, especially in a dense region. Thus, a detailed method for modeling the blockage events in the in-venue scenarios is introduced. Also, several mmWave access points are considered in different locations. To maximize the network sum rate, the resource allocation problem is formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, which is NP-hard in general. Hence, a three-stage low-complex solution is proposed to solve the problem. At first, a user scheduling algorithm, i.e., modified worst connection swapping (MWCS), is proposed. Secondly, the antenna allocation problem is solved using the simulated annealing algorithm. Afterward, to maximize the network sum rate and guarantee the quality of service constraints, a non-convex power allocation optimization problem is solved by adopting the difference of convex programming approach. The simulation results show that, under the blockage effect, the proposed mmWave-NOMA scheme performs on average 23% better than the conventional mmWave-orthogonal multiple access scheme. Moreover, the proposed solution's performance is close to the optimal value while reducing complexity by 96%. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

To improve performance on CGRA, modulo scheduling is commonly adopted on Data Dependence Graph (DDG) of loops by minimizing the Initiation Interval (II) between adjacent loop iterations. The mapping process usually consists of scheduling and placement-and-routing (PR). As existing approaches don't fully and globally explore the routing strategies of the long dependencies in a DDG at the scheduling stage, the following PR is prone to failure leading to performance loss. To this end, this paper proposes a routability-enhanced scheduling for CGRA mapping using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation, where a global optimized scheduling could be found to improve the success rate of PR. Experimental results show that our approachh achieves 1.12\times and 1.22\times performance speedup, 28.7% and 50.2% compilation time reduction, as compared to 2 state-of-the-art heuristics.  © 2013 IEEE.},

The aim of this study has been to schedule tamping activities in such a way that the total maintenance costs and the number of unplanned tamping activities are minimized. To achieve this, the track geometry tamping scheduling problem was defined and formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model and a genetic algorithm was used to solve the problem. Both the standard deviation of the longitudinal level and the extreme values of isolated defects were used to characterize the track geometry quality and to plan maintenance activities. The performance of the proposed model was tested on data collected from the Main Western Line in Sweden. The results show that different scenarios for controlling and managing isolated defects will result in optimal scheduling plan. It is also found that to achieve more realistic results, the speed of the tamping machine and the unused life of the track sections should be considered in the model. Moreover, the results show that prediction of geometry condition without considering the destructive effect of tamping will lead to an underestimation of the maintenance needs by 2%. © 2020 The Author(s).

The objective function optimizes the operation of renewable energy resources and startup/shutdown costs of nonrenewable energy resources along with the main grid and storage units' costs as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. The optimization problem is solved based on a modified bird mating optimization (MBMO) algorithm and a novel cumulative mutation process. In order to capture the high uncertainties associated with the market price, Photovoltaic, Wind Turbine output powers, and load demands, a reduced unscented transformation (RUT) method has been exploited. The RUT method can effectively model the correlation of variables using (m+2) sampling points. The framework presented in this paper has considered five case studies with multiple seasonal and property features. Implementing the proposed framework on a typical test microgrid and a real large-scale microgrid proves its effectiveness and accuracy through various operational conditions, changing the storage units' structure and characteristics, RESs' correlation modeling, and avoiding convergence to local minimums by adopting a newly mutated population. This extensive analysis provides options for MG operation by studying compound cases and providing solutions for every scenario.

Active demand management is usually carried out through load shifting based on specific techniques, such as optimisation, heuristics, model-based predictive control and machine learning methodologies. This work addresses the problem of residential load scheduling via optimisation techniques. A compressive receding horizon strategy is proposed for week-ahead load shifting, and the selection is driven by traditional receding horizon and day-ahead allocation strategy misalignment, with weekly household appliance usage patterns. The proposed approach is compared with receding horizon and day-ahead scheduling techniques over 30 different weeks for a prototypical smart home with non-controllable demand, which is representative of a four-resident family and includes micro power generation and battery storage. The simulation results confirm the validity of the proposed strategy in the context of household appliance scheduling problems and show competitive electricity costs and resident discomfort performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, the proposed compressive receding horizon strategy fully exploits weather and photovoltaic generation forecasts to promote self-consumption and grid demand stress reduction while providing environmental gains and financial benefits to the utility service and consumers, particularly in the case of simultaneously scheduling a huge number of households.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The cyclic hoist scheduling problem (CHSP) is a well-studied optimisation problem due to its importance in industry. Despite the wide range of solving techniques applied to the CHSP and its variants, the models have remained complicated and inflexible, or have failed to scale up with larger problem instances. This article re-examines modelling of the CHSP and proposes a new simple, flexible constraint programming formulation. We compare current state-of-the-art solving technologies on this formulation, and show that modelling in a high-level constraint language, MiniZinc, leads to both a simple, generic model and to computational results that outperform the state of the art. We further demonstrate that combining integer programming and lazy clause generation, using the multiple cores of modern processors, has potential to improve over either solving approach alone. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Services such as Meituan and Uber Eats have revolutionized the way the customer can find and order from restaurants. Numerous independent restaurants are competing for orders placed by customers via online food ordering platforms. Ordering takeout food on smartphone apps has become more and more prevalent in recent years. There are some operational challenges that takeout food service providers have to deal with, e.g., customer demand fluctuates over time and region. In this sense, the service providers sometimes ignore the fact that some riders may be idle in several periods in regions, while, in contrast, there may be a shortage of riders in other situations. In order to address this problem, we introduce a two-stage model to optimize scheduling of riders for instant food deliveries. A service provider platform expectantly schedules the least quantity of riders to deliver within expected arrival time to satisfy customer demand in different regions and time periods. We introduce a two-stage model that adopts the method of mixed-integer programming (MIP), characterize relevant aspects of the scenario, and propose an optimization algorithm for scheduling riders. We also divide the delivery service region and time into smaller parts in terms of granularity. The large neighborhood search algorithm is validated through numerical experiments and is shown to meet the design objectives. Furthermore, this study reveals that the optimization of rider resource is beneficial to reduce overall cost of the delivery. Takeout food service platforms decide scheduling shifts (start time and duration) of the riders to achieve a service level target at minimum cost. Additional sensitivity analyses, such as the tightness of the order time windows associated with the orders and riders' familiarity with delivery regions, are also discussed. © 2021 Guiqin Xue et al.},

To optimize the demand of water distribution system, pump's nonlinear scheduling and hydraulic factors, and daily water usage of buildings are added to the formulation. In addition, thermal management of electric chillers considering customers’ comfort level and outside temperature forecast was formulated. For a summer cooling schedule, it is shown that adjusting the indoor temperature settings at 20–25 °C for both occupied and unoccupied hours offers the lowest daily operation cost and peak demand charges. A fixed temperature setting of 25 °C during the occupied and unoccupied hours results in a lower daily cost and demand charges than a wide temperature setting of 15–30 °C. Lowest daily costs and electricity demand can be achieved within the proposed integrated water-energy microgrid with optimal water demand and building thermal energy management. By incorporating the water system constraints in the optimization model, hourly cost savings up to $150 can be achieved. In addition, incorporating building's thermal management in the proposed economic dispatch model can result in up to $20 hourly energy saving in the water-energy system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Microgrid with hybrid renewable energy sources is a promising solution where the distribution network expansion is unfeasible or not economical. Integration of renewable energy sources provides energy security, substantial cost savings and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, enabling nation to meet emission targets. Microgrid energy management is a challenging task for microgrid operator (MGO) for optimal energy utilization in microgrid with penetration of renewable energy sources, energy storage devices and demand response. In this paper, optimal energy dispatch strategy is established for grid connected and standalone microgrids integrated with photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT), fuel cell (FC), micro turbine (MT), diesel generator (DG) and battery energy storage system (ESS). Techno-economic benefits are demonstrated for the hybrid power system. So far, microgrid energy management problem has been addressed with the aim of minimizing operating cost only. However, the issues of power losses and environment i.e., emission-related objectives need to be addressed for effective energy management of microgrid system. In this paper, microgrid energy management (MGEM) is formulated as mixed-integer linear programming and a new multi-objective solution is proposed for MGEM along with demand response program. Demand response is included in the optimization problem to demonstrate it’s impact on optimal energy dispatch and techno-commercial benefits. Fuzzy interface has been developed for optimal scheduling of ESS. Simulation results are obtained for the optimal capacity of PV, WT, DG, MT, FC, converter, BES, charging/discharging scheduling, state of charge of battery, power exchange with grid, annual net present cost, cost of energy, initial cost, operational cost, fuel cost and penalty of greenhouse gases emissions. The results show that CO2 emissions in standalone hybrid microgrid system is reduced by 51.60% compared to traditional system with grid only. Simulation results obtained with the proposed method is compared with various evolutionary algorithms to verify it’s effectiveness. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Peak-shaving is a very efficient and practical strategy for a day-ahead hydropower scheduling in power systems, usually aiming to appropriately schedule hourly (or in less time interval) power generations of individual plants so as to smooth the load curve while enforcing the energy production target of each plant. Nowadays, the power marketization and booming development of renewable energy resources are complicating the constraints and diversifying the objectives, bringing challenges for the peak-shaving method to be more flexible and efficient. Without a pre-set or fixed peak-shaving order of plants, this paper formulates a new peak-shaving model based on the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to solve the scheduling problem in an optimization way. Compared with the traditional peak-shaving methods that need to determine the order of plants to peak-shave the load curve one by one, the present model has better flexibility as it can handle the plant-based operating zones and prioritize the constraints and objectives more easily. With application to six cascaded hydropower reservoirs on the Lancang River in China, the model is tested efficient and practical in engineering perspective. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The quantity of electrical coal transported through the tramp shipping network is increasing due to the high demands. This trend has increased the scheduling difficulty combined with the underdevelopment of the private thermal power plant port. The high coal consumption and low port storage capacity requires the scheduling of the tramp ship to be on a strict time window to ensure the continuous operation of the thermal power plant. The low port unloading capacity often leads to the port congestion and delay of the unloading operation. This paper develops a mixed-integer-programming model for the optimization of the tramp ship scheduling to reduce the total operation cost, including the transportation cost and the unloading waiting cost, and the branchand- price algorithm is adopted to solve this large-scale model. The model and algorithm are tested with historical operation data from the thermal power plant in the southern coastal areas of China. The optimized scheme significantly reduces the total operation cost by reducing the unloading waiting time and the number of active vessels in certain periods. The results also demonstrate the algorithm improvement in the aspects of the optimization quality and efficiency comparing with the heuristic solution.  © 2021 Ang Yang et al.},

	abstract = {Network function virtualization (NFV) is an emerging paradigm that has revolutionized the deployment and provisioning of telecommunication network services (NS). In NFV, a network service is implemented as a chain of network functions (NFs). NFs are virtualized and packaged into virtual network functions (VNF), so that they can be decoupled from the physical middleboxes and dynamically deployed on standard virtualization platforms in cloud or datacenters. Therefore, NFV has the potential to provide significant cost reductions in operating expenses (OPEX) and capital expenses (CAPEX) and increased agility for network service deployments. However, to build and manage a network function virtualization infrastructure (NFVI) is challenging. One of the key problems is to determine the mapping between underlying physical resources and VNFs in order to minimize energy consumption without violating service-level agreements (SLA). Many previous studies use embedding solutions to solve the problem by only considering the resource demand of NS and the resource capacity of physical network at a given time instance. But in practice, the resource demands of NS can vary over time, hence the embedding decision must be reconfigured accordingly. Many techniques can be used for reconfiguration, including resource scaling, instance migration and traffic re-direction. But each of these operation is associated with some costs, such as service interruptions, and additional resource or energy consumption. In this work, we investigate various reconfiguration strategies, formulate their costs by designing a model in the NFV placement problem, and propose Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and heuristic solutions, called REAP. In our evaluation, we observed 60% and 25% cost reduction for energy and reconfiguration costs, and we analyze the cost reduction from each of the reconfiguration methods to validate the design of our heuristic algorithm.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Unlike traditional mixed-integer optimisation methods, this approach involves formulating this problem as a multistage mixed-integer optimal control problem (MSMIOCP) and using a methodology that enables solution as a standard nonlinear optimisation problem. The methodology's features of a feasible path approach and scheduling catalyst changeovers without combinatorial optimisation techniques can be advantageous in providing reliable, robust and efficient solutions in comparison to mixed-integer methods. The MSMIOCP formulation is applied to the case study of an industrial process that operates a single feed over a set of 4 parallel reactors and produces a single product.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new approach based on the moth flame optimizer algorithm. Moth flame optimizer simulates the natural fervent navigation technique adopted by moths looking for a source of light. The proposed method is further improved by priority list-based ordering; the unit commitment problem (UCP) is a non-linear, non-convex, and combinatorial complex optimization problem. It contains both continuous and discrete variables. This further increases its complexity. Moth flame optimizer is very good at obtaining a commitment pattern: allocation of power on the committed units obtained by mixed-integer quadratic programming method. Heuristic search strategies are used to adopt for the repair of minimum up and downtime, and spinning reserve constraints. MFO effectiveness is tested on the standard UCP reference IEEE model buses 14 and 30, and 10 and 20 units. The efficiency of the projected algorithms is compared to classical PSO, PSOLR, HPSO, PSOSQP, hybrid MPSO, IBPSO, LCA-PSO, NPSO, PSO-GWO, and various other evolutionary algorithms. The comparison result shows that MFO can lead to all methods reported earlier in literature.  © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Decision diagrams (DDs) have proven to be useful tools in combinatorial optimization. Relaxed DDs represent discrete relaxations of problems, can encode essential structural information in a compact form, and may yield strong dual bounds. We propose a novel construction scheme for relaxed multi-valued DDs for a scheduling problem in which a subset of elements has to be selected from a ground set and the selected elements need to be sequenced. The proposed construction scheme builds upon A* search guided by a fast-to-calculate problem-specific dual bound heuristic. In contrast to traditional DD compilation methods, the new approach does not rely on a correspondence of DD layers to decision variables. For the considered kind of problem, this implies that multiple nodes representing the same state at different layers can be avoided, and consequently also many redundant isomorphic substructures. For keeping the relaxed DD compact, a new mechanism for merging nodes in a layer-independent way is suggested. For our prize-collecting job sequencing problem, experimental results show that the DDs from our A*-based approach provide substantially better bounds while frequently being an order-of-magnitude smaller than DDs obtained from traditional compilation methods, given about the same time. To obtain a heuristic solution and a corresponding lower bound, we further propose to construct a restricted DD based on the relaxed one, thereby substantially exploiting already gained information. This approach outperforms a standalone restricted DD construction, basic constraint programming and mixed integer linear programming approaches, and a variable neighborhood search in terms of solution quality on most of our benchmark instances. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {In recent years, efficient logistics has become indispensable, and using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones is promising for considerably reducing the cost and time required for parcel delivery. This paper addresses a parcel delivery scheduling problem. In this problem, a truck loaded with drones and parcels leaves a distribution center and stops at some points on a fixed route. At each point, the drones take off and deliver parcels to customers. We define this problem as finding the assignment of customers to both the drones and their takeoff points. Then, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA) for finding a near-optimal solution in a short time. In the proposed GA, a solution is represented using sets of customers assigned to the takeoff points, and a heuristic rule determines the assignment to the drones. The crossover operation enables offspring to inherit the customer sets. Experimental results show that the proposed GA can successfully find an optimal or a near-optimal solution faster than an integer programming solver for almost all instances. In addition, it significantly outperforms other GAs using a different crossover.  © 2021 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

	abstract = {Route scheduling is crucial for uninterrupted operation of modern bus fleets consisting of electric buses. This paper proposes an exact route scheduling optimization model for centralized bus depots based on mixed integer linear programming. In order to adjust to the current situation at many electric bus depots, the model considers a heterogeneous fleet consisting of multiple types of electric buses with different battery capacities. With additional charging scheduling the model can minimize the number of buses charging simultaneously which directly leads to load peak reduction. This allows considering further parameters, such as for example the grid capacity limit. The model can be used to minimize the necessary number of buses, to define the optimum composition of the fleet as well as to minimize the total cost of the fleet. The results show a clear cost advantage of operating a heterogeneous fleet as well as the benefits of combined route- and charging scheduling. Timetables from five real depots from the city of Hamburg in Germany were used as examples in this paper. Analysis of the proposed model using real data can provide a valuable input to other transportation companies preparing for the electrification of their fleet.  © 2020 IEEE.},

To solve the CFSASP efficiently, two variants of rolling horizon heuristics (RHHs) have been developed and applied on the case of a Norwegian broiler production company. Computational results show that the RHHs successfully obtain high-quality solutions within a reasonable time. The value of optimisation is verified through comparison with the case company's plans, where the solutions from optimisation outperforms the current solutions. Sensitivity analyses are also conducted to provide managerial insights regarding certain strategic decisions, such as how many and which days to use for hatching of chickens. Due to the promising results, the case company is now implementing an optimisation-based decision support system based on the MIP model and solution methods shown in this paper. © 2020 The Author(s).

The proposed model considers different features of MGs, including distributed generation (DG) units, plug in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and demand response (DR) programs. Three DR programs are modeled including, load shifting, load curtailing, and time of use (TOU) programs. Uncertainties of renewable generations and loads are modeled using a computationally competitive approach. Both controlled and uncontrolled charging/discharging patterns of PHEVs are investigated. To enhance tractability, the proposed model is formulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone programing (MISOCP) problem to minimize operational cost subject to technical and financial constraints. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, it is examined on the balanced 33-bus test systems in different case studies of DFR and OGS. The optimization problem is solved using the GAMS software package. It is found that PHEVs and DR not only enhances MG operation flexibility, but they also reduce the total operation cost and smooth load profile. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Dispatchers may put in place different recovery actions, such as alternating train directions and allowing short turns. The objective is to alleviate the inconvenience for passengers and to regain the nominal train regularity. To characterize this process, this paper develops nonlinear mixed integer programming (NMIP) models with two different recovery strategies to reschedule trains during the disruption. For solving models in real time, the hybrid formulation, which couples big-M and time-indexed formulations, is proposed to linearize the proposed model as the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. Then, a two-stage approach is designed for handling the real-time detected information (like dynamic arriving passengers and end time of the disruption), including offline task (to select the best recovery strategy) and online task (to implement the best strategy and update timetable). Finally, the numerical experiments from Beijing metro Line 2 are implemented to verify the performance and effectiveness of the proposed hybrid formulation and two-stage approach. © 2019},

In the studied facility, located in northern Spain, the annual production of the plant requires 95,000 MWh of electrical energy and 525,000 MWh of thermal energy. The installed electrical and thermal power is 20.4 MW and 81 MW, respectively. A mixed integer linear programming model is built to optimize gas allocation, thus maximizing its benefits. This model is applied to a 24âh scenario with real data from the plant, where gas allocation decisionâmaking was performed by the plant operators. Application of the model generated profit in a scenario where there were losses, increasing benefits by 16.9%. A sensitivity analysis is also performed.

Motivated by this need, this article proposes a two-stage stochastic optimization model for day-ahead energy and reserve scheduling of IMMG systems. The objective of the proposed model is to minimize total operation cost of IMMG while the frequency security of system is preserved within a predefined range. To this end, the hierarchical frequency structure of IMMG system including primary, secondary, and tertiary control levels are precisely formulated in mixed-integer linear programming format which can be efficiently solved by optimization software package. Meanwhile, to promote the proposed model, responsive loads and energy storage systems are considered in the energy and reserve scheduling problem. The proposed model is applied to a typical IMMG system to optimize energy and reserve scheduling over 24-hr horizon. The obtained results verify that through the proposed model, the operation costs of MGs are minimized while frequency security of the system is preserved in a cost-effective manner. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {The order assignment in the food delivery industry is of high complexity due to the uneven distribution of order requirements and the large-scale optimization of workforce resources. The delivery performance of employees varies in different conditions, which further exacerbates the difficulty of order assignment optimization. In this research, a non-linear multi-objective optimization model is proposed with human factor considerations in terms of both deteriorating effect and learning effect, in order to acquire the optimal solutions in practice. The objectives comprised the minimization of the operational cost in multiple periods and the workload balancing among multiple employees. The proposed model is further transformed to a standardized mixed-integer linear model by the exploitation of linearization procedures and normalization operations. Numerical experiments show that the proposed model can be easily solved using commercial optimization softwares. The results indicate that the variance of employee performance can affect the entire delivery performance, and significant improvement of workload balancing can be achieved at the price of slight increase of the operational cost. The proposed model can facilitate the decision-making process of order assignment and workforce scheduling in the food delivery industry. Moreover, it can provide managerial insights for other labor-intensive service-oriented industries. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper concerns a case study for optimal planning and coordination of railway maintenance windows and train traffic. The purpose is to validate a previously presented optimization model on a demanding real-life problem instance and to obtain results that apply in similar planning situations. A mixed integer linear programming model is used for a 913 km long, single-track railway line through the northern part of Sweden, with traffic consisting of 82 trains per day, most of which are freight trains. Cyclic 1-day schedules are produced, which show that 2 h long maintenance windows can be scheduled with small adjustments of the train traffic. The sensitivity for cost changes is studied, which shows that the train costs must increase by more than 30% in order to change the structure of the window solutions. Resource efficient window schedules are obtained by assigning maintenance teams to all windows while respecting crew work and rest time restrictions. A comparison with manually constructed plans from the Swedish Transport Administration indicates that larger window volumes can be scheduled at a lower cost and with solution structures which are deemed reasonable and useful as guidance for constructing the real window patterns. Finally, we estimate that using an integrated planning approach (where maintenance and trains are jointly planned) instead of a sequential approach (where a train timetable has precedence over the maintenance windows), will give maintenance cost savings of 11–17%, without incurring any large cost increases for the train traffic. The paper also presents a method for achieving cyclic schedules without any period-deciding variables, and discusses the consequences of the aggregated capacity usage model that has been adopted. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This article establishes a new multiunmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV)-enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) system, where a number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are deployed as flying edge clouds for large-scale mobile users. In this system, we need to optimize the deployment of UAVs, by considering their number and locations. At the same time, to provide good services for all mobile users, it is necessary to optimize task scheduling. Specifically, for each mobile user, we need to determine whether its task is executed locally or on a UAV (i.e., offloading decision), and how many resources should be allocated (i.e., resource allocation). This article presents a two-layer optimization method for jointly optimizing the deployment of UAVs and task scheduling, with the aim of minimizing system energy consumption. By analyzing this system, we obtain the following property: the number of UAVs should be as small as possible under the condition that all tasks can be completed. Based on this property, in the upper layer, we propose a differential evolution algorithm with an elimination operator to optimize the deployment of UAVs, in which each individual represents a UAV's location and the entire population represents an entire deployment of UAVs. During the evolution, we first determine the maximum number of UAVs. Subsequently, the elimination operator gradually reduces the number of UAVs until at least one task cannot be executed under delay constraints. This process achieves an adaptive adjustment of the number of UAVs. In the lower layer, based on the given deployment of UAVs, we transform the task scheduling into a 0-1 integer programming problem. Due to the large-scale characteristic of this 0-1 integer programming problem, we propose an efficient greedy algorithm to obtain the near-optimal solution with much less time. The effectiveness of the proposed two-layer optimization method and the established multi-UAV-enabled MEC system is demonstrated on ten instances with up to 1000 mobile users. © 2013 IEEE.},

Also, the jobs are expected to be finished in a time window, instead of a constant due date. A mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model is proposed to formulate this problem. Due to the special characteristics of the studied problem and its NP-hard computational complexity, a metaheuristic based on Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm has been proposed.

	abstract = {The single machine scheduling problem which involves uncertain job due dates is one of the most important issues in the real make-to-order environment. To deal with the uncertainty, this paper establishes a robust optimization model by minimizing the maximum tardiness in the worst case scenario over all jobs. Unlike the traditional stochastic programming model which requires exact distributions, our model only needs the information of due date intervals. The worst case scenario for a given sequence that belongs to a set containing only n scenarios is proved, where n is the number of jobs. Then, the model is simplified and reformulated as an equivalent mixed 0-1 integer linear programming (MILP) problem. To solve the MILP problems efficiently, a heuristic approach is proposed based on a robust dominance rule. The experimental results show that the proposed method has the advantages of robustness and high calculating efficiency, and it is feasible for large-scale problems. © 1990-2011 Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information.},

	abstract = {A new convex optimization framework for approximately solving timetabling problems that can be described as integer linear programs is proposed. The method is based on converting the timetabling problem into a cardinality constrained problem while viewing the operational constraints of the timetable as noisy measurements with an unknown average slack. The problem is then iteratively solved using weighted Lasso with weights that are updated using a simple linear program to satisfy the cardinality constraint while respecting the operational constraints in the least squares sense. Compared with previous convex relaxations for solving timetabling problems, our solution technique will converge to a binary solution without the need for subsequent randomized rounding. Moreover, the number of Lasso iterations required are in the order of the number of events to be scheduled and hence the method can handle very large timetabling problems using efficient Lasso solvers. We provide the assumptions required on the linear timetabling model and establish the associated error bound of the technique upon convergence assuming restricted strong convexity and uniqueness. We also study the effect of the Lasso regularization parameter and the effect of relaxing the objective on the extent of constraint satisfaction through several simulation experiments. Our experiment on one of the benchmark datasets for university examination timetabling improved the best documented result by more than 30% with 99.9% of all constraints satisfied. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Therefore, in this paper, the optimization of the microgrid operation, the commitment of generators and the charging/discharging of ESSs, is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with inter-temporal constraints. In order to find the optimal solution to the problem effectively, we propose a parallel computation method based on the generalized Bender's decomposition and the optimality condition decomposition.

With the goal of minimizing the operating cost, the location and route optimization problems of mobile parcel lockers are integrated into a non-linear integer programming model. An embedded GA has been developed to optimally determine the locations of distribution points, the number of mobile parcel lockers needed by each distribution point and the schedules and routes of mobile parcel lockers, simultaneously. Finally, a numerical example is given to compare the optimization results of the schemes with and without the aggregation problem. The results show that the scheme with the aggregation problem can greatly save the delivery time.

	abstract = {Nowadays, electricity market paradigms are constantly changing. On the one hand, the deployment of non-dispatchable renewable energy sources is bringing out the necessity of representing hourly dynamics in medium-term fundamental models. On the other, the promotion of new interconnection capacity and the integration of markets (as is the case of the European market) makes necessary the simultaneous modeling of multiple electricity systems. Thus, the large size of power markets, together with the consideration of uncertainty in some inputs, make it computationally intractable to work rigorously on an hourly detailed time span. Temporal aggregation, integer programming relaxation or less accurate generation modeling are usually employed to obtain reasonable computation times. However, the application of these techniques often leads to infeasible or suboptimal operational outputs. This paper proposes a new soft-linking methodology to meet reliable results from medium-term models, such as hourly prices or aggregated productions, with a feasible and detailed representation of the thermal generation, considering technical constraints and risk aversion. The results of a fundamental model that represents the competitive behavior between market players in a multi-area power system are used as the starting point for the methodology. Then, a post-processing method is applied to optimize and make feasible the thermal portfolio of a market agent. The final output is a feasible hourly scheduling and an ample space for optimization, where the introduction of a strategic term represents the rational behavior of a player who tries to maximize its profit.  © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the Model Predictive Control (MPC) based energy scheduling of a smart microgrid equipped with non-controllable (i.e., with fixed power profile) and controllable (i.e., with flexible and programmable operation) electrical appliances, as well as photovoltaic (PV) panels, and a battery energy storage system (BESS). The proposed control strategy aims at a simultaneous optimal planning of the controllable loads, the shared resources (i.e., the storage system charge/discharge and renewable energy usage), and the energy exchange with the grid. The control scheme relies on an iterative finite horizon on-line optimization, implementing a mixed integer linear programming energy scheduling algorithm to maximize the self-supply with solar energy and/or minimize the daily cost of energy bought from the grid under time-varying energy pricing. At each time step, the resulting optimization problem is solved providing the optimal operations of controllable loads, the optimal amount of energy to be bought/sold from/to the grid, and the optimal charging/discharging profile for the BESS. The proposed energy scheduling approach is applied to the demand side management control of the marina of Ballen, Samsø (Denmark), where a smart microgrid is currently being implemented as a demonstrator in the Horizon2020 European research project SMILE. Simulations considering the marina electric consumption (340 boat sockets, a service building equipped with a sauna and a wastewater pumping station, and the harbour master's office equipped with a heat pump), PV production (60kWp), and the BESS (237 kWh capacity) based on a public real dataset are carried out on a one year time series with a 1 h resolution. Simulations indicate that the proposed approach allows 90% exploitation of the production of the PV plant. Furthermore, results are compared to a naïve control approach. The MPC based energy scheduling improves the self-supply by 1.6% compared to the naïve control. Optimization of the business economy using the MPC approach, instead, yields to 8.2% savings in the yearly energy cost with respect to the naïve approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {On an oversaturated urban rail transit line, passengers at downstream stations have to wait for more trains until they get aboard, resulting in service imbalance problem. To improve the service quality, this paper proposes an integrated optimization approach combining the train timetabling and collaborative passenger flow control, with the aim of minimizing indicators associated with the passenger service imbalance and train loading capacity utilization. Considering train regulation constraints and passenger loading dynamics, a mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated. Based on the linear weighting technique, an iterative heuristic algorithm combining the tabu search and Gurobi solver is designed to solve the proposed model. Finally, a simple case with different-scale instances is used to verify that the proposed algorithm can obtain near-optimal solution efficiently. Moreover, a real-world case of Beijing Subway Batong Line is implemented to compare performances of the proposed approach with those under the original timetable and noncollaborative passenger flow control.  © 2020 Chaoqi Gong et al.},

	abstract = {Because of zero emissions and other social and economic benefits, electric vehicles (EVs) are currently being introduced in more and more transit agencies around the world. One of the most challenging tasks involves efficiently scheduling a set of EVs considering the limited driving range and charging requirement constraints. This study examines the battery-electric transit vehicle scheduling problem (BET-VSP) with stationary battery chargers installed at transit terminal stations. Two equivalent versions of mathematical formulations of the problem are provided. The first formulation is based on the deficit function theory, and the second formulation is an equivalent bi-objective integer programming model. The first objective of the math-programming optimization is to minimize the total number of EVs required, while the second objective is to minimize the total number of battery chargers required. To solve this bi-objective BET-VSP, two solution methods are developed. First, a lexicographic method-based two-stage construction-and-optimization solution procedure is proposed. Second, an adjusted max-flow solution method is developed. Three numerical examples are used as an expository device to illustrate the solution methods, together with a real-life case study in Singapore. The results demonstrate that the proposed math-programming models and solution methods are effective and have the potential to be applied in solving large-scale real-world BET-VSPs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {An airport gate is the core resource of an airport operation, which is an important place for passengers to get on and off the aircraft and for maintaining aircraft. It is the prerequisite for other related dispatch. Effective and reasonable allocation of gates can reduce airport operating costs and increase passenger satisfaction. Therefore, an airport gate assignment problem (AGAP) needs to be urgently solved in the actual operation of the airport. In this paper, considering the actual operation of the airport, we formulate an integer programming model for AGAP by considering multiple constraints. The model aims to maximize the number of passengers on flights parked at the gate. A tabu search-based algorithm is designed to solve the problem. In the process of algorithm design, an effective initial solution is obtained. A unique neighborhood structure and search strategy for tabu search are designed. The algorithm can adapt to the dynamic scheduling of airports. Finally, tests are performed using actual airport data selected from Kunming Changshui International Airport in China. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can enhance the local search ability and global search ability and get satisfactory results in a limited time. These results provide an effective support for the actual gate assignment in airport operations. Copyright © 2020 Jun Bi et al.

Due to their small size, however, microgrids may have financial limitations which preclude them from using commercial software to optimize control of their assets. Open-source optimization solvers are a viable alternative, but increase computation time. This work expands on a rolling horizon optimization framework for economic dispatch within an existing residential microgrid located in Hoover, Alabama. The microgrid has an open-source solver requirement and a need for quick solution time on a rolling horizon as opposed to a day-ahead commitment. We present a method of reducing integer variables by relaxation which completes two goals: reduction in computation time for real-time operations, and reduction in daily operational cost for the microgrid. Seasonal data for load and photovoltaic (PV) power was also collected from the microgrid to facilitate simulation testing. Computation time was successfully reduced using multiple variations of the relaxation method, while obtaining solution quality with operational cost similar to or better than the original model. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to reduce carbon emissions and costs in an automobile production plant by improving the operational management efficiency of a serial assembly line assisted by a feeding electric tow vehicle (ETV). Design/methodology/approach: A multi-objective function is formulated to minimize the energy consumption of the ETV from which emissions and costs are measured. First, a mixed-integer linear programming model is used to solve the feeding problem for different sizes of the assembly line. Second, a bi-objective optimization (HBOO) model is used to simultaneously minimize the most eco-efficient objectives: the number of completed runs (tours) by the ETV along the assembly line, and the number of visits (stops) made by the ETV to deliver kits of components to workstations. Findings: The most eco-efficient strategy is always the bi-objective optimal solution regardless of the size of the assembly line, whereas, for single objectives, the optimization strategy differs depending on the size of the assembly line. Research limitations/implications: Instances of the problem are randomly generated to reproduce real conditions of a particular automotive factory according to a previous case study. The optimization procedure allows managers to assess real scenarios improving the assembly line eco-efficiency. These results promote the implementation of automated control of feeding processes in green manufacturing. Originality/value: The HBOO-model assesses the assembly line performance with a view to reducing the environmental impact effectively and contributes to reducing the existent gap in the literature. The optimization results define key strategies for manufacturing industries eager to integrate battery-operated motors or to address inefficient traffic of automated transport to curb the carbon footprint. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Four applications, namely the molecular conformation problem, job-shop scheduling problem, manufacturing cell formation problem, and the vehicle routing problem, are specifically addressed. Large-scale instances of these application problems across multiple scales ranging from molecular design to logistics optimization are computationally challenging for deterministic optimization algorithms on classical computers. To address the computational challenges, hybrid QC-based algorithms are proposed and extensive computational experimental results are presented to demonstrate their applicability and efficiency.

In this problem, customers request services from a company. Each service is composed of dependent tasks, which are executed by teams of varying skills along one or more days. Tasks belonging to a service may be executed by different teams, and customers may be visited more than once a day, as long as precedences are not violated. The objective is to schedule and route teams so that the makespan is minimized, i.e., all services are completed in the minimum number of days. In order to solve this problem, we propose a Mixed-Integer Programming model, a constructive algorithm and heuristic algorithms based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) metaheuristic. The presence of precedence constraints makes it difficult to develop efficient local search algorithms. This motivates the choice of the ACO metaheuristic, which is effective in guiding the construction process towards good solutions. Computational results show that the model is capable of consistently solving problems with up to about 20 customers and 60 tasks. In most cases, the best performing ACO algorithm was able to match the best solution provided by the model in a fraction of its computational time. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The calculation of the required electric stations is carried out by estimating the yearly consumption of electricity over a long-time plan and then determining the required number of stations. The aim is to minimize the total establishing and operating costs of the stations based on a mathematical programming model with nonlinear objective function and integer decision variables. The introduced model is applied for a real practical case study to conclude the number of yearly constructed stations over a long-term plan in the electricity sector in Jeddah City,Saudi Arabia. The current planning method is based only on intuition by constructing the same number of required stations in each year without searching for better solutions. To solve the introducedmathematical model, a novel recent gaining sharing knowledge-based algorithm, named GSK, has been used. The Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) is applied to transform the constrained formulation to become unconstrained with penalization to the objective function. According to the obtained results of the real case study, the proposed GSK with ALM approved an ability to solve this case with respect to convergence, efficiency, quality, and robustness.  © 2020 Said Ali Hassan et al.},

This paper studies the hybrid flow shop scheduling problem, where jobs are multiprocessors. The objective is to minimize total completion time. Although there are several papers considering the hybrid flow-shop scheduling problem with multiprocessor tasks, none has proposed a mathematical model for this problem. At first, the two problems (fixed and selective cases) are mathematically formulated by mixed integer linear programming models. By using commercial software, the model is used to solve the small instances of the problems. Moreover, an elephant herding optimization is developed to solve large instances of the problems. To numerically evaluate the proposed algorithm, it is compared with three available algorithms in the literature. © 2020 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this work, we investigate the problem of lifetime optimization for partial coverage in heterogeneous sensor networks. This problem which is NP-Hard in its general form is known under the name of α-coverage, where α refers to a prescribed level of coverage threshold that we need to maintain. Sleep-Awake scheduling which turns sensors to On and Off, is the common and the well known technique that has been heavily studied in the literature to deal with energy management under coverage constraint. The question is how to orchestrate the clustering of the sensor nodes into disjoint or non-disjoint covers, and to schedule these covers, so that the total network's lifetime is maximized. Unlike earlier works, we consider both global (whole targets) resp. local (individual target) monitoring thresholds to improve the coverage quality rather than dealing with a single global leveling threshold as in the literature. In addition, instead of employing a default covers’ activation which may lead to the starvation phenomenon, where targets may remain uncovered for a long time period, we provide a clairvoyant scheduling for the obtained covers to ensure fair smoothing for the cumulated target's uncovered time periods during the network's service. First, a novel mathematical Binary Integer Linear Programming (BILP) is proposed to solve the α-coverage problem to optimality. Then, provable guarantees of the upper bound for the number of partial cover sets are given. Next, we formulate the covers’ planning as a p-dispersion problem and due to the NP-Completeness of the former, an efficient Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach is designed to achieve efficient covers’ scheduling with minimal execution time complexity. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted and several QoS metrics are evaluated to show the usefulness of our proposals. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

In particular, closed form and semi-closed form solutions to difficult integer programs are achieved via rigorous mathematical analysis. The proposed model is general for exploring the capacity of various satellite network deployments whose solutions have not been obtained in prior studies. Furthermore, we verify the potential capacity of the different transmission schemes based on the proposed solutions and prove that the system's network capacity can be significantly improved by the hybrid transmission scheme.

Then, in the upper-level problem, the aggregator leads the competition taking advantages of demand-side management including interruptible and shiftable loads to minimise its energy payment for real-time pricing of generation units. By means of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality condition, the bilevel optimisation of Stackelberg game is reduced to a single-level mixed-integer linear programming problem.

	abstract = {Steam supply scheduling (SSS) plays an important role in providing uninterrupted reliable energy to meet the heat and electricity demand in both the industrial and residential sectors. However, the system complexity makes it challenging to operate efficiently. Besides, the operational objectives in terms of economic cost and thermodynamic efficiency are usually contradictory, making the online scheduling even more intractable. To this end, the thermodynamic efficiency is evaluated based on exergetic analysis in this paper, and an economic-exergetic optimal scheduling model is formulated into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Moreover, the ε-constraint method is used to obtain the Pareto front of the multi-objective optimization model, and fuzzy satisfying approach is introduced to decide the unique operation strategy of the SSS. In the single-period case results, compared with the optimal scheduling which only takes the economic index as the objective function, the operation cost of the multi-objective optimization is increased by 4.59%, and the exergy efficiency is increased by 9.3%. Compared with the optimal scheduling which only takes the exergetic index as the objective function, the operation cost of the multi-objective optimization is decreased by 19.83%, and the exergy efficiency is decreased by 2.39%. Furthermore, results of single-period and multi-period multi-objective optimal scheduling verify the effectiveness of the model and the solution proposed in this study. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Energy efficiency of train operations is influenced largely by the speed control and the scheduled running time in the train timetable. In practice, the running time of a train is often determined in the train timetabling process at the macroscopic level while the energy-efficient speed control of a train on a segment is often determined at the microscopic level with the given timetable. They are usually optimized separately due to limited computational resources, which however may result in sub-optimal solutions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel integrated micro-macro approach for better incorporating train energy-efficient speed control into the railway timetabling process. Firstly, we formulated the integrated train timetabling and speed control optimization problem as a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model. Due to its complexity, we reformulate it on the basis of flow conservation theory in a space–time-speed (STS) network and solve the problem in two steps. In the first step, a set of pre-solved energy-efficient train trajectory templates is generated by a segment-level optimization approach with consideration of train travel time, entry speed and exit speed to save computation time. In the second step, a near-optimum train energy-efficient timetable solution is found by a fast algorithm, which consists of the shortest generalized cost path algorithm, conflict detection and resolution algorithm, and calculation of dynamic headways between two successive trains. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the developed approach provides better outcomes than the benchmark case in terms of both train journey time and energy consumption. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The local search has two operators: the first is a neighbourhood structure based on a disjunctive graph model, and the second is similar to crossover in the genetic algorithm to avoid falling into local optima. Computational results are presented for a set of benchmark tests. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and indicate whether the processing time of the job conforms to a uniform distribution.

In order to preserve, as much as possible, the confidentiality of the features of prosumers' equipment and the production and load forecasts, the problem is addressed by designing a specific distributed procedure based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The distributed procedure calculates the scheduling of the available energy resources to limit the balancing action of the external grid and allocates the internal network losses to the various power transactions.

	abstract = {The Fifth Generation (5G) New Radio (NR) Physical Layer (PHY) is designed to successfully address diverse user and service requirements by providing a highly flexible framework. This flexibility is viable through a scalable numerology. Since 5G NR targets to multiplex various applications with different quality of service requirements within the same band, 3rd Generation Partnership Project has introduced a mixed (multi) numerology approach and a mini-slot approach to enhance the adaptability of the PHY. In this contribution, we compare these two approaches focusing on the achievement of low-latency communications. We propose optimization problems that enable to maximize the achievable rate of best effort users, while maintaining latency requirements of low-latency users. Exploiting achievable rate performance as one of the fundamental metrics, we show a comparison of mixed numerology and mini-slot approach in different circumstances. In addition to Cyclic Prefix (CP)-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), we employ Universal Filtered Multicarrier (UFMC) as a potential beyond 5G technology and show that it achieves an improvement over CP-OFDM. The optimization problems for both mixed numerology and the mini-slot approach are initially given by an integer programming solution. In order to reduce computational complexity for large-scale scenarios, we apply the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition method, showing that it is possible to achieve the optimal solution with significantly reduced complexity by exploiting the structure of the proposed optimization formulation.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The existing production scheduling mode ignores ladle dispatching resulting in the increase of energy consumption in ladle heating and instability in production. Hence, we study the energy-efficient integration optimization of production scheduling and ladle dispatching in this paper. Specifically, a mixed integer linear programming model is formulated to coordinate the time-dependent correlations between them and quantify the energy consumption of them. Moreover, an enhanced migrating birds optimization algorithm (EMBO) is proposed to tackle this NP-hard integration optimization problem. In this proposed algorithm, a three-level rule-based heuristic decoding is designed to achieve the optimal solutions at the given production sequence; well-designed neighborhood structures are appended to intensify exploration; a simulated annealing-based acceptance criterion is hired to escape from local optima. Additionally, a novel competitive mechanism for birds regrouping is developed to increase the population diversity by information exchange between the left and right lines of V-formation. Mass experimental results demonstrate that the proposed EMBO observably outperforms all the compared algorithms, and the proposed integration optimization decreases the energy-consumption by 1.21% in the context of constant production efficiency. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

However, uncertainties related to demand and renewable sources pose a major operational challenge to schedule the DERs. In this paper, a scenario-based mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed for an energy management system (EMS) of a local energy community. The proposed EMS executes a stochastic day-ahead scheduling operation of multi-energy systems (MES). A set of scenarios are generated with the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to consider uncertainties of demand and renewable sources. Moreover, Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) are performed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed EMS compared to the deterministic one. The proposed method is validated by using a real-world case study of a generic Dutch university medical campus in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Two types of analysis are performed: one-day analysis and seasonal analysis. In both cases, in an average, the stochastic process outperforms the deterministic process considerably, in terms of cost, CO2 emission, imported electricity from grid and usage of local energy resources. © 2020 The Authors},

The voltage-dependent nature of loads is taken into account to further reduce the operating cost by managing the voltage levels. Branch and cut method is applied to handle the integrality constraints associated with the operation of DCDs. A globally convergent trust region algorithm (TRA) is applied to solve the integer-relaxed problems at each node during the branching process. The TRA subproblems are solved using interior point method. To reduce the branching burden of branch and cut algorithm, before applying TRA at each node, a simplified optimization problem is first solved. Using the convergence status and value of objective function of this problem, a faster decision is made on stopping the regarding branch. Solving the simplified problem obviates the application of TRA at most nodes. It is shown that the method converges to the optimal solution with a considerable saving in computation time according to the numerical studies.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

According to their heterogeneous service requirements, multiple legitimate users are categorized as security-required users (SUs) and quality of service (QoS)-required users (QUs), while these QUs can potentially act as internal eavesdroppers which are curious about the secrecy transmissions of SUs. In such a context, our goal is to maximize the achievable minimum secrecy rate among SUs through the joint optimization of user scheduling, power allocation, and trajectory design, subject to the QoS requirements of QUs and the mobility constraint of UAV-BS. Due to the non-convexity of the problem, an efficient iterative algorithm is firstly proposed, based on the alternative optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods and along with a penalty-based algorithm to deal with the introduced binary integer variables, to obtain a sub-optimal solution. Then, we propose an SUs-oriented low-complexity algorithm by taking advantage of the inherent characteristics of the optimization problem, which can efficiently reduce the computational complexity and can act as a reasonable initial solution for the previous iterative algorithm to achieve better performance. Finally, the superiority of our proposed scheme compared with the conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) one is validated by numerical simulation results.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

In addition, renewable energy sources (RES) in China are characterized by centralized distribution. In view of the cross-regional flexible scheduling of large-scale grid-connected RES, we build a day-ahead optimization model which considers the generation economy and robustness of transmission for each regional grid. The model considers the spatial clustering effect of RES and loads, uses robust optimization theory to construct uncertainty sets, and introduces uncertain spatial constraint parameters to compensate for the insufficiency of traditional robust optimization. Furthermore, a co-evolutionary algorithm filter-based is proposed to solve above the mixed-integer non-convex nonlinear programming model. Taking the modified IEEE-39 nodes as an example, the results show that the system cost can be reduced by 21.9% by selecting the confidence probability of uncertain variables of both load and source under stable operation, while the prediction accuracy has a significant impact on the system cost when the confidence probability is smaller, and a better operation scheme can be obtained by increasing the space constraint parameters.

The proposed platform is a web-based application which acquires the load profile of the customer, associated flexible appliances, and the customer preferences for using the appliances. In turn, presents the optimal operation schedule for flexible appliances and attained benefits from using the optimal schedule. To calculate the optimal operation schedule, a mixed-integer linear optimization model is devised where the decision variables are settings of flexible appliances, charge/discharge status and amount of storage device, charge/discharge status, and amount of electrical vehicle. The devised optimization engine is linked to a database to acquire required data for optimization which encompasses historical data for customer load, forecasts of renewables, ratings of customers' flexible appliances, and subjected energy tariff. The attained optimal scheduling for the customer is then returned to the database. On the other hand, the database is linked to the web-based user interface to get the user preferences (write to the database) and represent the recommendation for optimal operation and attained benefits (read from database). To manage the links between web-based user interface, database, and optimization tool, proper linking application programming interfaces (APIs) are devised.

The objective is to minimize outpatients' total spent time in a radiology center. The problem is formulated as a flexible open shop scheduling problem and a stochastic programming model. By considering the specific distribution function for uncertain variables, deterministic mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is developed such that the proposed problem can be solved by a linear programming solver in small size. Besides an effective heuristic method is proposed for the moderate size problem. To indicate the applicability of the proposed model, it has been applied to a real radiology center.

	abstract = {In the past few years, the development of demand response (DR) programs for smart grid systems has provided residential customers with a real opportunity to participate in DR-driven projects. One typical DR-related application now available is automated energy scheduling for residential building, which can be used to help reduce energy costs. Residential energy scheduling focuses on saving cost by managing the operation time and energy consumption level of different appliances. Demand Response programs present as NP-hard problems, the equations are non-convex mixed integer non-linear problems (MINLP), for which it is difficult to obtain an optimal solution. In relation to residential DR, we propose a hybrid approach here that is able to solve an MINLP. The problem is decomposed into discrete and continuous variables. The discrete variables are optimized by using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, whilst the continuous variables are determined by using a gradient-based deterministic algorithm. The superiority of the proposed algorithm was demonstrated by compared with commercial optimization software and heuristic based algorithm. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed method in residential DR was tested and the results were presented. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Mobile energy storage systems (MESSs) provide promising solutions to enhance distribution system resilience in terms of mobility and flexibility. This paper proposes a rolling integrated service restoration strategy to minimize the total system cost by coordinating the scheduling of MESS fleets, resource dispatching of microgrids, and network reconfiguration of distribution systems. The integrated strategy takes into account damage and repair to both the roads in transportation networks and the branches in distribution systems. The uncertainties in load consumption and the status of roads and branches are modeled as scenario trees using Monte Carlo simulation method. The operation strategy of MESSs is modeled by a stochastic multi-layer time-space network technique. A rolling optimization framework is adopted to dynamically update system damage, and the coordinated scheduling at each time interval over the prediction horizon is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear program with temporal-spatial and operation constraints. The proposed model is verified on two integrated test systems, one is with Sioux Falls transportation network and four 33-bus distribution systems, and the other is the Singapore transportation network-based test system connecting six 33-bus distribution systems. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of MESS mobility to enhance distribution system resilience due to the coordination of mobile and stationary resources. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Network slicing has been considered as a promising candidate to provide customized services for vehicular applications that have extremely high requirements of latency and reliability. However, the high mobility of vehicles poses significant challenges to resource management in such a stochastic vehicular environment with time-varying service demands. In this paper, we develop an online network slicing scheduling strategy for joint resource block (RB) allocation and power control in vehicular networks. The long-term time-averaged total system capacity is maximized while guaranteeing strict ultra-reliable and low-latency requirements of vehicle communication links, subject to stability constraints of task queues. The formulated problem is a mixed integer nonlinear stochastic optimization problem, which is decoupled into three subproblems by leveraging Lyapunov optimization. In order to tackle this problem, we propose an online algorithm, namely JRPSV, to obtain the optimal RB allocation and power control at each time slot according to the current network state. Furthermore, rigorous theoretical analysis is conducted for the proposed JRPSV algorithm, indicating that the system capacity and the system average latency obey a [O(1/V), O(V)] trade-off with the control parameter V. Extensive simulation results are provided to validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of JRPSV as well as the impacts of various parameters. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

Docks are responsible to provide a place for goods before being delivered to the customers. Then, these materials are directly loaded into outbound trucks with little or no storage in between to send to customers in the shortest possible time. This paper is mainly aimed at introducing a mixed-integer, non-linear programming model to solve scheduling several cross-docking problems. The proposed model is highly facilitated to allocate the most optimal destinations to storage doors and truck scheduling in docks while selecting the collection and delivery routes. Using optimization approaches at uncertainty conditions is also of great importance.

	abstract = {The importance of compliance with the schedule of work of road trains on the highway transport network of the European Union is shown. The possible options for work and rest modes for truck drivers on international routes have been analyzed. A model for optimizing the truck fleet operation plan has been developed. This model has two levels, that is, the general graph contains subgraphs designed with incompatible vertices to determine the active and shortest schedule. Each of the subgraphs reflects alternative routes and schedules of a truck. The model also includes restrictions on the total cycle time and active period duration of available unloading points. To find the shortest schedule, integer programming with a guaranteed optimal solution was applied. Testing of the proposed algorithm was performed for the example of serving orders for international freight transportation between the cities of Ukraine, Poland, and the Czech Republic. The active schedule is based on the criterion of the minimum of the total duration of drivers' work. The results obtained are valid, consistent with the rules of the European Agreement. They indicate that the choice of the best schedule for a single car on a unitary route is not the best solution for the entire truck fleet and the entire flow of orders. © 2020 Silesian University of Technology.

	abstract = {This paper presents the optimal scheduling of a diesel generator and an energy storage system (ESS) while using a detailed battery ESS energy efficiency model. Optimal scheduling has been hampered to date by the nonlinearity and complexity of the battery ESS. This is due to the battery ESS efficiency being a multiplication of inverter and battery efficiency and the dependency of an inverter and any associated battery efficiencies on load and charging and discharging. We propose a combined mixed-integer linear programming and particle swarm optimization (MILP-PSO) algorithm as a novel means of addressing these considerations. In the algorithm, MILP is used to find some initial points of PSO, so that it can find better solution. Moreover, some additional algorithms are added into PSO to modify and, hence, improve its ability of dealing with constraint conditions and the local minimum problem. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than MILP and PSO alone for the practical microgrid. The results also indicated that simplification or neglect of ESS efficiency when applying MILP to scheduling may cause a constraint violation. © 2020 by the authors.

The resulting optimisation model is the main original contribution of the presented paper.

In almost all cases, we were able to achieve maximum throughput and minimum energy usage simultaneously, and in those cases where this was not possible, the costs incurred in one objective in order to achieve the other were typically low. The solution times for all network sizes were of the order of seconds, showing that our optimisation model is feasible to use in practice. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

This is often due to modeling as well as optimization complexities. However, simplified models may significantly degrade the performance of BESS operation in practice. Therefore, in this article, we propose a new BESS scheduling optimization framework that accounts for features such as cell-to-cell variations in maximum capacity, charge level balance, and internal resistance. The proposed framework is in the form of tractable mixed integer linear programs. Our approach is to estimate and update the device-level battery model parameters continuously, without the need to interrupt BESS normal operation. We validate the performance compared to an offline approach, which is based on dedicated model testing and calibration. To assure accurate performance evaluation, this article also includes developing a power hardware-in-the-loop testbed that allows for flexible operation and detailed monitoring of BESS under different design scenarios. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With limited computing resources and a lack of physical lines of defense, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a focus of cyberattacks. In recent years, outbreak propagation attacks against the IoT have occurred frequently, and these attacks are often strategical. In order to detect the outbreak propagation as soon as possible, t embedded Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are widely deployed in the IoT. This paper tackles the problem of outbreak detection in adversarial environment in the IoT. A dynamic scheduling strategy based on specific IDSs monitoring of IoT devices is proposed to avoid strategic attacks. Firstly, we formulate the interaction between the defender and attacker as a Stackelberg game in which the defender first chooses a set of device nodes to activate, and then the attacker selects one seed (one device node) to spread the worms. This yields an extremely complex bilevel optimization problem. Our approach is to build a modified Column Generation framework for computing the optimal strategy effectively. The optimal response of the defender’s problem is expressed as mixed-integer linear programming (MILPs). It is proved that the solution of the defender’s optimal response is a NP-hard problem. Moreover, the optimal response of defenders is improved by an approximate algorithm--a greedy algorithm. Finally, the proposed scheme is tested on some randomly generated instances. The experimental results show that the scheme is effective for monitoring optimal scheduling. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {This brief deals with the satisfaction of the daily cooling demand by a hybrid system that consists of a vapor-compression refrigeration cycle and a thermal energy storage (TES) unit, based on phase change materials. The addition of the TES tank to the original refrigeration plant allows to schedule the cooling production regardless of the instantaneous demand, given that the TES tank can store cold energy and release it whenever deemed appropriate. The scheduling problem is posed as an optimization problem based on mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) since it includes both discrete and continuous variables. The latter corresponds to the references on the main cooling powers involved in the problem (cooling production at the evaporator and TES charging/discharging), whereas the discrete variables define the operating mode scheduling. Therefore, in addition to the hybrid features of the physical plant, a hybrid optimal control strategy is also proposed. A receding horizon approach is applied, similar to model predictive control (MPC) strategies, while economic criteria are imposed in the objective function, as well as feasibility issues. The TES state estimation is also addressed since its instantaneous charge ratio is not measurable. The proposed strategy is applied in simulation to a challenging cooling demand profile, and the main advantages of the MINLP-based strategy over a nonlinear MPC-based scheduling strategy previously developed are highlighted, regarding operating cost, ease of tuning, and ability to adapt to cooling demand variations. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Optimization tools are widely used for solving the short-term hydro scheduling (STHS) problem in a cascaded hydro system. In a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based formulation, the nonlinear and non-convex hydropower production function (HPF) is represented by piecewise linear approximation. However, instead of using a set of predefined curves with static breakpoints or a preprocessing phase to define the complete relationship between the power output, the net head, and the water discharge, this paper proposes a novel method in which the breakpoints in the linearization are determined dynamically, taking into account the time-varying head effect, intake loss, penstock loss, tailrace loss, and head-dependent turbine efficiency. Only one binary variable is needed to indicate the on/off status and power generation of a unit per period. Furthermore, there are few studies available on how to represent the HPF precisely for the hydraulic system where penstocks are shared by multiple generating units. In this paper, we investigate three heuristics to explicitly incorporate the nonlinear and state-dependent power loss in shared penstocks into the STHS problem. The method and heuristics have been implemented in an operational STHS tool used by many hydropower producers in Nordic countries. We use a simple hydro system to illustrate the method and heuristics and a real hydro system in Northern Norway to study calculation efficiency and solution quality. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method can precisely represent the head-dependent and nonlinear operating characteristics of the generating units. The accurate modeling of a system with multi-level shared penstock configurations is crucial for obtaining the optimal unit commitment. The heuristics can effectively handle the power loss in shared penstock in various operating conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Actual ED implementation in the MEMS relies on an optimization software package called an optimization solver. This paper presents a comparative study of optimization solvers to investigate their suitability for ED implementation in the MEMS. Four optimization solvers, including commercial as well as open-source-based ones, were compared in terms of their computational capability and optimization results for ED. Two-stage scheduling was applied for the ED strategy, whereby a mixed-integer programming problem was solved to yield the optimal operation schedule of battery-based energy storage systems. In the first stage, the optimal schedule is identified one day before the operating day; in the second stage, the optimal schedule is updated every 5 min during actual operation to compensate for operational uncertainties. A modularized programming strategy was also introduced to allow for a comparison between the optimization solvers and efficient writing of codes. Comparative simulation case studies were conducted on three test-bed MGs to evaluate the optimization results and computation times of the compared optimization solvers. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty of renewable generation is a major challenge in power system operation. Without scheduling enough fast reserves, the load shedding or wind curtailments are expected under rapid deviations of renewable generation. Therefore, the flexible ramp (FR) reserves are scheduled in short-term horizons to compensate the uncertainties of renewable resources and load demand. In this paper, a very short-term economic dispatch (ED) model is developed to handle the wind and load uncertainties using FR reserve. FR products refer to rapid 10-minute spinning reserves that are provided by the fast-response generating units and energy storage (ES) devices to handle the load and wind uncertainties in both upward and downward directions. The proposed model minimizes the costs of generation, contingency reserve, FR reserves, and charging of battery ES. Technical constraints of generating units and the transmission network limits are considered. The future scheduling hour is divided into six 10-minute intervals and the generation levels and required reserves are optimized for the subsequent receding 10-minute intervals. Point estimate (PE) method is utilized to reduce the wind generation and load uncertainty scenarios. The efficacy of PE method is compared with Monte Carlo technique. In addition to credible scenarios of wind and load uncertainties, some regional worst-case scenarios are considered in each electric area to minimize the amount of FR underestimation. The proposed ED model is formulated as a stochastic mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that is solved using CPLEX algorithm in GAMS for the IEEE 118-bus and 300-bus test systems. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Yearly generation maintenance scheduling (GMS) of generation units is important in each system such as combined heat and power (CHP)-based systems to decrease sudden failures and premature degradation of units. Imposing repair costs and reliability deterioration of system are the consequences of ignoring the GMS program. In this regard, this research accomplishes GMS inside CHP-based systems in order to determine the optimal intervals for predetermined maintenance required duration of CHPs and other units. In this paper, cost minimization is targeted, and violation of units' technical constraints like feasible operation region of CHPs and power/heat demand balances are avoided by considering related constraints. Demand-response-based shortterm generation scheduling is accomplished in this paper considering the maintenance intervals obtained in the long-term plan. Numerical simulation is performed and discussed in detail to evaluate the application of the suggested mixed-integer quadratic programming model that implemented in the General Algebraic Modeling System software package for optimization. Numerical simulation is performed to justify the model effectiveness. The results reveal that longterm maintenance scheduling considerably impacts short-term generation scheduling and total operation cost. Additionally, it is found that the demand response is effective from the cost perspective and changes the generation schedule. © 2020 by the authors.},

In this study, a continuous berth scheduling problem with the DLSM model is illustrated and solved with exact and heuristic methods with an objective to minimize the total operation cost, including both the additional transportation cost for vessels not located at their minimum-cost berthing position and the penalties for vessels not being able to leave as planned. First of all, this problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming model and solved by the CPLEX solver for small-size instances. Afterwards, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is developed to obtain good quality solutions within reasonable execution time for large-scale problems. Experimental results show that DLSM mode can not only greatly reduce the total operation cost but also significantly improve the efficiency of berth scheduling in comparison with the widely used single-line ship mooring (SLSM) mode. The comparison made between the results obtained by the proposed PSO algorithm and that obtained by the CPLEX solver for both small-size and large-scale instances are also quite encouraging. To sum up, this study can not only validate the effectiveness of DLSM mode for heavy-loaded ports but also provide a powerful decision support tool for the port operators to make good quality berth schedules with the DLSM mode.  © 2020 Cheng Luo et al.},

Our objective is to obtain an online offloading algorithm to minimize the energy consumption of all the UEs, by jointly optimizing the positions of GVs and UAVs, user association and resource allocation in real time, while considering the dynamic environment. To this end, we propose a hybrid deep-learning-based online offloading (H2O) framework where a large-scale path-loss fuzzy c-means (LS-FCM) algorithm is first proposed and used to predict the optimal positions of GVs and UAVs. Second, a fuzzy membership matrix U-based particle swarm optimization (U-PSO) algorithm is applied to solve the mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems and generate the sample data sets for the deep neural network (DNN) where the fuzzy membership matrix can capture the small-scale fading effects and the information of mutual interference. Third, a DNN with the scheduling layer is introduced to provide the user association and computing resource allocation under the practical latency requirement of the tasks and limited available computing resource of H-MEC. In addition, different from the traditional DNN predictor, we only input one UE's information to the DNN at one time, which will be suitable for the scenarios where the number of UE is varying and avoid the curse of dimensionality in DNN. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the linear scheduling method (LSM) approach to the linear project scheduling optimization problem has been widely studied by researchers. In this paper, the problem of resource leveling of linear projects under the framework of LSM is studied. Firstly, the concept of a third type of float is proposed, and the advantages of this third type of float to the optimization of linear project resource leveling are analyzed. On this basis, a two-stage optimization process of the linear project resource leveling problem based on the third type of float is proposed. The process takes into account new constraints such as total resource constraint, resource utilization constraint, and construction mileage constraint, and it aims to maximize the space-time flexibility of construction activities and realize the depth optimization of linear project resource leveling. According to the integer nonlinear characteristic of the model, a quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm with a constraint processing mechanism and particle search range restriction is designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by case analysis and comparison of the results in previous studies. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

	abstract = {Renewable energy resources such as wind, either individually or integrated with other resources, are widely considered in different power system studies, especially self-scheduling and offering strategy problems. In the current paper, a three-stage stochastic multi-objective offering framework based on mixed-integer programming formulation for a wind-thermal-energy storage generation company in the energy and spinning reserve markets is proposed. The commitment decisions of dispatchable energy sources, the offering curves of the generation company in the energy and spinning reserve markets, and dealing with energy deviations in the balancing market are the decisions of the proposed three-stage offering strategy problem, respectively. In the suggested methodology, the participation model of the energy storage system in the spinning reserve market extends to both charging and discharging modes. The proposed framework concurrently maximizes generation company's expected profit and minimizes the expected emission of thermal units applying lexicographic optimization and hybrid augmented-weighted ∊-constraint method. In this regard, the uncertainties associated with imbalance prices and wind power output as well as day-ahead energy and spinning reserve market prices are modeled via a set of scenarios. Eventually, two different strategies, i.e., a preference-based approach and emission trading pattern, are utilized to select the most favored solution among Pareto optimal solutions. Numerical results reveal that taking advantage of spinning reserve market alongside with energy market will substantially increase the profitability of the generation company. Also, the results disclose that spinning reserve market is more lucrative than the energy market for the energy storage system in the offering strategy structure. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Key relevant applications of MES are multienergy districts (MEDs) with, for example, integrated electricity and gas distribution and district heating networks. Simulation and optimization of MEDs is a grand challenge requiring sophisticated techno-economic tools that are capable of modeling buildings and distributed energy resources (DERs) across multienergy networks. This article provides a tutorial-like overview of the state-of-the-art concepts for techno-economic modeling and optimization of integrated electricity-heat-gas systems in flexible MEDs, also considering operational uncertainty and multiple grid support services. Relevant mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations for two-stage stochastic scheduling of buildings and DER, iteratively soft-coupled to nonlinear network models, are then presented as the basis of a practical network-constrained MED energy management tool developed in several projects.

MU-MIMO enables simultaneous transmission to multiple receivers (Space Division Multiplexing) and simultaneous reception from multiple transmitters (Space Division Multiple Access). The main contribution is the extension to MU-MIMO of the Network Utility Maximization (NUM) scheduling framework for multi-hop networks. We generalize to MU-MIMO the classic proof that Maximum Back Pressure (MBP) scheduling is NUM optimal. MBP requires the solution of an optimization that becomes harder with MU-MIMO radios. In prior models with one-to-one transmission and reception, each valid schedule was a matching over a graph. However, with MU-MIMO each valid schedule is, instead, a Directed Bipartite SubGraph (DBSG). In the general case this prevents finding efficient algorithms to solve the scheduler. We make MU-MIMO MBP scheduling tractable by assuming fixed power allocation, so the optimal scheduler is the Maximum Weighted DBSG. The MWDBSG problem can be solved using standard Mixed Integer Linear Programing. We simulate multi-hop mmWave picocellular networks and show that a MU-MIMO MBP scheduler enables a 160% increase in network throughput versus the classic one-to-one MBP scheduler, while fair rate allocation mechanisms are used in both cases. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

We compare, through computational experiments, two types of solution algorithms. The first combines classical MILP formulations with row-and-column generation algorithms. The second generalizes the classical branch-and-bound algorithms to the robust context, extending state-of-the-art concepts used for the deterministic version of the problem. By generalizing the classical branch-and-bound algorithm we are able to assemble and discuss good algorithmic decisions steps that once put together make our robust branch-and-bound case attractive. For example, we extend and adapt dominance rules to our uncertain problem, making them an important component of our robust algorithms. We assess our algorithms on instances inspired by the scientific literature and identify under what conditions an algorithm has better performance than others. We introduce a new classifying parameter to group our instances, also extending existing methods for the deterministic problem case. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Space and water heating are two major components of household energy consumption, and a number of work has been done to combine multiple residential heating technologies to develop hybrid heating solutions that are more flexible, efficient and economical. This paper studied and modelled a smart home with a novel hybrid heating system, which consists of a wall-hung gas boiler (for both space and water heating) that is connected to a water tank with an auxiliary electric resistance heater (for water heating), and auxiliary split air conditioners (for space heating). A multi-objective optimization was further formulated to optimally schedule the gas and electricity consumption of a smart home equipped with the hybrid heating system as well as an onsite photovoltaic (PV) system, a battery energy storage system, an electric vehicle and various types of flexile loads. Two objectives, i.e. the minimization of operating energy cost (including both electricity and gas payment) and the maximization of thermal comfort, were considered. The optimization problem was finally transformed to a single objective mixed integer linear programming problem that can be solved by existing optimization solvers. Simulation results verified the operational performance of the studied hybrid heating system and the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling method. Sensitivity analysis was conducted considering various levels of electricity/gas prices, onsite PV capacity, battery capacity and outdoor air temperature, and it shows that in all the scenarios the operating energy cost of the smart home with the hybrid heating system was always lower than that with the pure electricity or pure gas heating systems. The performance under various uncertainties and the benefits of adopting model predictive control were also demonstrated. It is noted that this paper only focuses on the optimal scheduling and operation costs of the hybrid heating system. Optimal configuration and sizing of the heating system with the initial investment (i.e. capital expenditures) considered are identified as research directions in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In modern distribution networks (DNs), soft open points (SOPs) are newly introduced power electronic devices that are installed between the adjacent feeders in place of normally open points. The SOPs contribute in Volt/VAr control by accurately adjusting the active power flow and supporting the reactive power from both AC sides. A further step forward alludes to energy storage–integrated SOPs, referred to as E-SOP, which could significantly influence the active power exchanges through charge/discharge actions in appropriate time intervals, say as the hours with high- and low-price electricity tariffs. Accordingly, E-SOPs provide a unique opportunity in effective active power control and also Volt/VAr control in the presence of distributed generations (DGs) and renewables. This study proposes a model for day-ahead operation scheduling of DNs with high penetration of DGs and photovoltaic (PV) considering the installations of E-SOPs. An accurate linearized model is developed to consider the technical performance of E-SOP in power flow study. Voltage security, economic, and network emission indices are accounted as a concern of the network operator. To this end, a multi-objective optimization model is developed based on mixed-integer linear programming being tackled by an augmented ε-constraint method. For assessing the effectiveness of the developed model, it is simulated on the IEEE 33-node test system; however, the IEEE 119-node test system is also tailored to assess the scalability issues. The obtained results are mainly represented in terms of smart charge/discharge and effective VAr support of E-SOPs, reduced operation cost, improved voltage profile, and a reduced emission level. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

However, in many cases, there is a temporary need for DER supply, such as during peak grid prices and outages. Thus, mobile energy resources can be utilized in these cases to serve several customers at different locations. In this work, we propose a new approach for optimal operation of green mobile energy generation and storage systems (MEGSS). The aim of the proposed approach is to maximize the profit of the MEGSS fleet while meeting customers’ requirements. The outcomes of the proposed approach are the day-ahead optimal decisions regarding the customers to be served, the route to be followed by each MEGSS in the fleet, and the onboard resources scheduling. The MEGSS dispatch problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming (MIP), which is decomposed into two sub-problems: an outer sub-problem and an inner sub-problem. The outer sub-problem decides on the customers to be served and the route to be followed, while the inner sub-problem decides on the onboard resources scheduling. Different case studies are presented to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2021 ASTM International. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We propose an efficient algorithm to provide transportation routes and schedules to pick up medical specimens from clinics, physician’s offices, and hospitals and deliver them to a central laboratory quickly. This healthcare vehicle routing and scheduling problem differs from existing vehicle routing problems primarily in that, instead of minimizing driving time, the objective is to minimize the completion time, that is, the time from when the specimen is available for pickup until it is delivered to the central laboratory. We combine the routing problem with scheduling of vehicles and formulate a mixed integer linear program. We present a new algorithm to solve this optimization problem, called the Vehicle Routing and Scheduling Algorithm (VeRSA). VeRSA uses an indexing method inspired by scheduling methods to efficiently traverse a branch-and-bound tree associated with the mixed integer program. Instead of using a linear programming relaxation, as is common, we prove several propositions that lead to expressions that are fast to compute. We also prove a theoretical lower bound to provide some information on an optimality gap. Numerical results on three small and three large test problems demonstrate the high quality of solutions provided by VeRSA. The data in the large test problems are based on data provided by the University of Washington Medical Center (with modifications to protect confidentiality). The computational speed of VeRSA makes it applicable to real-time operational decisions when demand may be updated at any time due to cancellations or additional pickups. This model is applicable to other types of pickup and delivery systems where the waiting time of a package is important, such as perishable items. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Energy storage competitiveness is ubiquitously associated with both its technical and economic performance. This work investigates such complex techno-economic interplay in the case of Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES), with the aim to address the following key aspects: (i) LAES optimal scheduling and how this is affected by LAES thermodynamic performance (ii) the effect of LAES sizing on its profitability and performance (iii) overall techno-economic assessment of LAES multi-mode operation when providing energy and reserve services. To address these aspects, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming-based optimisation tool has been developed to simulate LAES operation throughout a year while including detailed thermodynamic constraints, thus allowing an accurate performance estimation. The results demonstrate that considering LAES thermodynamic performance in the optimisation ensures a feasible dispatch profile thus avoiding loss of revenues, especially for the multi-mode cases. However, while operation with arbitrage and a portfolio of reserve services is financially promising, it also deteriorates LAES roundtrip efficiency; therefore, a techno-economic balance should be sought. In terms of design, the possibility of independently sizing LAES charge and discharge power is key for tailoring the plant to the specific operating mode. Furthermore, storage energy capacities greater than 2–3 h do not significantly increase LAES profitability under the market conditions considered. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In future cellular networks, it is expected that data traffic will increase significantly due to deployments of large numbers of Internet of Things (IoT) objects. The IoT objects operate underlaying a cellular network, and they use Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication to transmit multicst messages. We propose to use Radio Frequency (RF) Energy Transmitters (ET) to compensate the IoT objects with the energy consumed in forwarding multicast messages. Our goal is to support multicast service for IoT objects and transmit energy to them such that the total transferred energy by the ETs is minimized. We formulated the problem mathematically as a non-convex Mixed Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP). Due to the difficulty of solving the problem optimally, we decompose the original problem into two sub-problems using Generalized Bender Decomposition with Successive Convex programming (GBD-SCP). Although this method facilitates finding a solution for the problem, the problem is still hard due to binary variables. Hence, we propose the Constraints Decomposition with SCP and Binary Variable Relaxation (CDR) algorithm to solve the problem more efficiently. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a performance close to the GBD-SCP algorithm while the computation time is reduced significantly when the network size is larger. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Energy Harvesting- (EH-) powered Device-to-Device (D2D) Communication underlaying Cellular Network (EH-DCCN) has been deemed as one of the basic building blocks of Internet of Things due to its green energy efficiency and adjacent communication. But available energy will be one of the biggest obstacles when implementing EH-DCCN due to the immaturity of EH technology and the volatility of environmental energy resources. To improve energy utilization, this study investigates an efficient scheduling and power allocation scheme about transmission load equilibrium in the time domain. Accordingly, a short-term Sum Energy Efficiency (stSEE) maximization problem for EH-powered D2D communication is modelled, while ensuring a fundamental transmission rate requirement of cellular users. Consequently, the optimization problem is a nonconvex mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. Thus, we propose a two-layer convex approximation iteration algorithm which can obtain a feasible quasioptimal solution for the stSEE problem. Simultaneously, a two-step heuristic algorithm in a slot-by-slot fashion is also developed to acquire a suboptimal solution without requiring statistical knowledge of channel and energy arrival processes. Simulated analysis indicates that the short-term scheduling strategy can obtain better performances in terms of energy efficiency and transmission rate than conventional real-time scheduling scheme. Besides, the maximum scheduled number of EH-D2D pairs underlaying one cellular user under different EH efficiency is analysed, which can give us a theoretical reference about the deployment of future EH-DCCN.  © 2020 Ying Luo et al.},

	abstract = {In this work, we consider the problem of scheduling a set of trains (i.e., determining their departure and arrival times at the visited stations) and simultaneously deciding their stopping patterns (i.e., determining at which stations the trains should stop) with constraints on passenger demand, given as the number of passengers that travel between an origin station and a destination station. In particular, we face the setting in which demand can be uncertain, and propose Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models to derive robust solutions in planning, i.e., several months before operations. These models are based on the technique of Light Robustness, in which uncertainty is handled by inserting a desired protection level, and solution efficiency is guaranteed by limiting the worsening of the nominal objective value (i.e., the objective value of the problem in which uncertainty is neglected). In our case, the protection is against a potential increased passenger demand, and the solution efficiency is obtained by limiting the train travel time and the number of train stops. The goal is to determine robust solutions in planning so as to reduce the passenger inconvenience that may occur in real-time due to additional passenger demand. The proposed models differ in the way of inserting the protection, and show different levels of detail on the required information about passenger demand. They are tested on real-life data of the Wuhan–Guangzhou high-speed railway line under different demand scenarios, and the obtained results are compared with those found by solving the nominal problem. The comparison shows that robust solutions can handle uncertain passenger demand in a considerably more effective way. © 2020},

	abstract = {Hard real-time systems focus on obtaining a feasible schedule while satisfying different temporal requirements. In safety-critical applications, this schedule is generated offline. This article explores different integer linear programming techniques (ILP) to schedule uniprocessor hard real-time systems. The goal is to efficiently obtain a static schedule for periodic tasks and partitioned systems where temporal and spatial isolation is crucial. The advantage of the proposed ILP techniques is the possibility of choosing the optimization criteria so that deadlines are met and better performance quality is achieved. The drawback is the time spent finding an optimal solution. We propose an ILP method that reduces by 70% the time needed to obtain an optimal solution compared to basic approaches. This method is called the rolling task MILP approach and the optimization problem is addressed task by task. Experimental results show that our approach also achieves better results than heuristics when trying to reduce temporal parameters such as response times, context switches, and jitter. This makes our solution suitable for control systems and other applications. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The customized bus (CB) transit is recognized as an effective transportation mode offering more flexible and demand-responsive service than traditional bus transit with fixed route and schedule, especially during the peak hours. The novelty of this study is the development of a mixed integer non-linear model for optimizing multi-terminal CB service in an urban setting. According to the estimated spatiotemporal passenger demand, the objective total cost, consisting of supplier's and users' costs, is minimized subject to capacity and time window constraints. A mixed bus fleet with various bus sizes is employed to accommodate passenger demand, which increases vehicle utilization and reduces supplier's cost. The inconvenience of passengers caused by early arrival at the destination is treated as penalty and considered in users' cost. The study optimization problem is combinatorial with many decision variables including trip assignment, bus routing and associated timetables, and fleet size. A hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) which integrates the features of genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA) is developed to effectively search for the optimal solution. A real-world CB network is employed to demonstrate the applicability of the developed model and explore the relation between the model parameters and optimized results. It was found that the total cost can be reduced by 16.5% after employing multiple terminals and a mixed bus fleet. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The increasing worldwide energy demand, the CO2 emissions generated due to the production and use of energy, climate change, and the depletion of natural resources are important concerns that require new solutions for energy generation and management. In order to ensure energy sustainability, measures, including the use of renewable energy sources, the deployment of adaptive energy consumption schemes, and consumer participation, are currently envisioned as feasible alternatives. Accordingly, this paper presents the requirements and algorithmic solutions for efficient management of energy consumption, which aims to optimize the use of available energy, whether or not it is 100% renewable, by minimizing the waste of energy. The proposal works within a Demand-Response environment, uses Network Functions Virtualization as an enabling technology, and leverages the massive connectivity of the Internet of Things provided by modern communications technologies. The energy consumption optimization problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Program. It is optimally solved while using a brute-force search strategy, defined as OPTTS, to detect all concerns that are related to the problem. Given the N P-hard nature of the problem and the non-polynomial complexity of OPTTS, some heuristic solutions are analyzed. Subsequently, a heuristic strategy, described as FASTTS based on a pre-partitioning method, is implemented. The simulation results validate our proposed energy management solution. Exact and heuristic strategies, when deployed in the Network Functions Virtualization domain, demonstrate improvements in the way that energy is consumed, thereby offering an increase in service processing. The evaluation results also show that FASTTS produces high-quality solutions that are close to those of OPTTS while executing 230×–5000× faster. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Proactive caching in mobile-edge computing (MEC) networks is promising to handle the ever-increasing demand for wireless video services, and transcoding at MEC servers further improves the flexibility of video content delivery. However, how to effectively conduct caching for adaptive bitrate streaming poses great challenges due to the uncertainty of user preferences. The caching decisions also have a profound impact on the system energy efficiency since they may change the video delivery modes. In this article, by integrating caching, transcoding, and backhaul retrieving in a MEC-enabled adaptive streaming system, we propose a holistic solution to jointly determine the caching of bitrate-aware files and the scheduling of video requests in an energy-efficient manner. Specifically, we leverage a data-driven approach to characterize the uncertainty of real request arrivals. Based on the uncertainty model, we formulate a data-driven risk-averse optimization to derive a robust strategy for caching and delivery scheduling, which is a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming (SMIP) with the goal of minimizing the total expected energy consumption. We also develop feasible solutions and conduct extensive simulations on real-world data sets. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in both the energy efficiency and the cache hit ratio. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the continuous increase of greenhouse gas emissions has led many companies to investigate the activities that have the greatest impact on the environment. Recent studies estimate that around 10% of worldwide CO2 emissions derive from logistical supply chains. The considerable amount of energy required for heating, cooling, and lighting as well as material handling equipment (MHE) in warehouses represents about 20% of the overall logistical costs. The reduction of warehouses' energy consumption would thus lead to a significant benefit from an environmental point of view. In this context, sustainable strategies allowing the minimization of the cost of energy consumption due to MHE represent a new challenge in warehouse management. Consistent with this purpose, a two-step optimization model based on integer programming is developed in this paper to automatically identify an optimal schedule of the material handling activities of electric mobile MHEs (MMHEs) (i.e., forklifts) in labor-intensive warehouses from profit and sustainability perspectives. The resulting scheduling aims at minimizing the total cost, which is the sum of the penalty cost related to the makespan of the material handling activities and the total electricity cost of charging batteries. The approach ensures that jobs are executed in accordance with priority queuing and that the completion time of battery recharging is minimized. Realistic numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the effects of integrating the scheduling of electric loads into the scheduling of material handling operations. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the model in identifying the optimal battery-charging schedule for a fleet of electric MMHEs from economic and environmental perspectives simultaneously. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Conventional thermal power system-based units and its participation schedule known as unit commitment problem (UCP) is a significant and stimulating undertaking of allocating generated power among the dedicated units subject to numerous restrictions above a scheduled time prospect to obtain the slightest generation cost. This problem becomes further more complex by increasing the size of the power system. Since unit commitment problem is link optimization problem as it has both binary and continuous variable that is why it is most challenging problem to solve. In this paper, a recently invented optimizer sine–cosine is used to solve unit commitment problem. Sine cosine algorithm (SCA) is an innovative population centered optimization algorithm that has been used for solving the unit commitment optimization problems bounded by some constraints centered on the concept of a mathematical model of the sine and cosine functions. This paper offers the solution of unit commitment optimization problems of the electric power system by using the SCA, as UCP is linked optimization as it has both binary and continuous variables, the strategy adopted to tackle both variables is different. In this paper, proposed sine cosine algorithm searches allocation of generators (units that participate in generation to take upload) and once units are decided, allocation of generations (economic load dispatch) is done by mixed integer quadratic programming. The feasibility and efficacy of operation of SCA algorithm are verified for small- and medium-power systems, in which results for 4 unit, 5 unit, 6 unit, 7 unit, 10 units, 19 unit, 20 unit and 40 units are evaluated. The 10 generating units are evaluated with 5% and 10% spinning reserve. The results obviously show that the suggested method gives the superior type of solutions as compared to other algorithms. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

The tasks may be spread across several locations, and have requirements regarding the time at which they can be handled, and the skills and skill levels needed to complete them. There is also a utility value related to each completed task that reflects its importance. The resources are bound by a hierarchy of command, limiting their movement in relation to one another. The aim is to decide which tasks to complete, when, and by whom. We present a mathematical compact model for the PTTP, which includes a number of complicating real-life factors. Due to the complexity of the compact model, it is difficult to solve large instances using a commercial solver. Therefore, we also propose a decomposition-based solution approach, with a decomposed model where possible travel routes for the resources are generated a priori. The computational study shows that the decomposed model has better performance than the compact model, and that it can be used as a good starting point for developing a useful decision support tool for military peacekeeping operations planning. © The Author(s) 2019.},

The proposed mechanism enables a microgrid agent (MGA), a central energy management agent (CEMA), and a coordination control agent (CCA) to cooperate efficiently during various stages including prescheduling, coordinated optimization, rescheduling and participation willingness analysis. Based on the limited information sharing between agents, energy scheduling models of agents and coordinated diagrams are constructed to demonstrate the different roles of agents and their interactions within the MMG system. Distributed schemes are introduced for MG internal operations considering demand response, while centralized schemes under the control of the CCA are proposed to coordinate MGAs. Participation willingness is defined to analyze the MGA's satisfaction degree of the matchmaking. A hierarchical optimization algorithm is applied to solve the above nonlinear problem. The upper layer establishes a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to optimize the internal operation problem of each MG, and the lower layer applies the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for coordination.

Unlike existing methodologies, the MSMIOCP formulation allows to solve this problem as a standard nonlinear optimisation problem without combinatorial optimisation methods, which can be advantageous in providing reliable, robust and efficient solutions. Using this formulation, four case studies of this problem, differing in reaction or deactivation kinetics, are investigated. Two different solution implementations are used, each having their own relative advantages. The first implementation demonstrates a bang-bang behaviour for the linear scheduling controls, consistent with a theoretical analysis, but faces integration problems and does not always produce high quality solutions. The second implementation, while not demonstrating the bang-bang property, always produces high quality solutions and shows the advantages of the MSMIOCP formulation over existing methodologies. © 2020},

	abstract = {In the literature on Network Optimization, k-splittable flows were introduced to enhance modeling accuracy in cases where an upper bound on the number of supporting paths for each commodity needs to be imposed, thus extending the suitability of network flow tools for an increased number of practical applications. Such modeling feature has recently been extended to dynamic flows with the introduction of the novel strongly NP-hard Quickest Multicommodity k-splittable Flow Problem (QMCkFP). Such a flows over time problem asks for routing and scheduling of each commodity demand through at most k different paths in a dynamic network with arc capacities per time step, while minimizing the time required by the overall process. In this work, we propose the first exact algorithm for solving the QMCkSFP. The developed technique falls within the Branch and Price class and is based on original relaxation, pricing and branching procedures. Linearization and variable substitution are used to obtain the relaxation problem from the path-based formulation of the QMCkSFP. The pricing problem is modeled as a Shortest Path Problem with Forbidden Paths with additional node-set resources on a time expansion of the original digraph and is solved via a tailored dynamic programming algorithm. Two branching rules are designed for restoring feasibility whenever k-splittable or binary variable domain constraints are violated. The results of an extensive batch of computational experiments conducted on small to medium-size reference instances are presented, showing a highly satisfactory performance of the proposed algorithm. The paper concludes with a discussion on further lines of research. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Concentrating solar power (CSP) tower technologies capture thermal radiation from the sun utilizing a field of solar-tracking heliostats. When paired with inexpensive thermal energy storage (TES), CSP technologies can dispatch electricity during peak-market-priced hours, day or night. The cost of utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) systems has dropped significantly in the last decade, resulting in inexpensive energy production during daylight hours. The hybridization of PV and CSP with TES systems has the potential to provide continuous and stable energy production at a lower cost than a PV or CSP system alone. Hybrid systems are gaining popularity in international markets as a means to increase renewable energy portfolios across the world. Historically, CSP-PV hybrid systems have been evaluated using either monthly averages of hourly PV production or scheduling algorithms that neglect the time-of-production value of electricity in the market. To more accurately evaluate a CSP-PV-battery hybrid design, we develop a profit-maximizing mixed-integer linear program (H) that determines a dispatch schedule for the individual sub-systems with a sub-hourly time fidelity. We present the mathematical formulation of such a model and show that it is computationally expensive to solve. To improve model tractability and reduce solution times, we offer techniques that: (1) reduce the problem size, (2) tighten the linear programming relaxation of (H) via reformulation and the introduction of cuts, and (3) implement an optimization-based heuristic (that can yield initial feasible solutions for (H) and, at any rate, yields near-optimal solutions). Applying these solution techniques results in a 79% improvement in solve time, on average, for our 48-h instances of (H); corresponding solution times for an annual model run decrease by as much as 93%, where such a run consists of solving 365 instances of (H), retaining only the first 24 h’ worth of the solution, and sliding the time window forward 24 h. We present annual system metrics for two locations and two markets that inform design practices for hybrid systems and lay the groundwork for a more exhaustive policy analysis. A comparison of alternative hybrid systems to the CSP-only system demonstrates that hybrid models can almost double capacity factors while resulting in a 30% improvement related to various economic metrics. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The model has a time horizon of 1 year with 1-day decision stages, considers sales of both energy and frequency restoration reserves (FRR) and is solved by stochastic dynamic programming. The novelty of the model is that it considers the producer's price-making ability in the FRR market. The proposed model is used to obtain the water values of an existing hydropower plant. The water values are then used to simulate the day-ahead scheduling of the hydropower plant in a 100-year scenario. The results are compared to those obtained without considering the producer's price-making ability in the FRR market. The profit increase is modest compared to the uncertainty existing in the day-ahead scheduling in all analysed cases. However, the water spillage is significantly lower if the producer's price-making ability in the FRR market is considered when computing the water value. This last result may have important implications for the plant's operation, especially when the reservoir is also used for the purpose of flood control, as the one used as case study in the paper, and many others all over the world. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Fierce competition between airlines has led to the need of minimising the operating costs while also ensuring quality of service. Given the large proportion of operating costs dedicated to aircraft maintenance, cooperation between airlines and their respective maintenance provider is paramount. In this research, we propose a framework to develop commercially viable and maintenance feasible flight and maintenance schedules. Such framework involves two multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MMILP) formulations and an iterative algorithm. The first formulation, the airline fleet maintenance scheduling (AMS) with violations, minimises the number of maintenance regulation violations and the number of not airworthy aircraft; subject to limited workshop resources and current maintenance regulations on individual aircraft flying hours. The second formulation, the AMS with tail assignment (TA) allows aircraft to be assigned to different flights. In this case, subject to similar constraints as the first formulation, six lexicographically ordered objective functions are minimised. Namely, the number of violations, maximum resource level, number of tail reassignments, number of maintenance interventions, overall resource usage, and the amount of maintenance required by each aircraft at the end of the planning horizon. The iterative algorithm ensures fast computational times while providing good quality solutions. Additionally, by tracking aircraft and using precise flying hours between maintenance opportunities, we ensure that the aircraft are airworthy at all times. Computational tests on real flight schedules over a 30-day planning horizon show that even with multiple airlines and workshops (16000 flights, 529 aircraft, 8 maintenance workshops), our solution approach can construct near-optimal maintenance schedules within minutes. © 2020},

Applied to oscillator characterization in the context of ultrastable clocks, stringent filtering requirements are defined by spurious signal or noise rejection needs. Since real-time radio frequency processing must be performed in a field-programmable array to meet timing constraints, we investigate optimization strategies to design filters meeting rejection characteristics while limiting the hardware resources required and keeping timing constraints within the targeted measurement bandwidths. The presented technique is applicable to scheduling any sequence of processing blocks characterized by a throughput, resource occupation and performance tabulated as a function of configuration characteristics, as is the case for filters with their coefficients and resolution yielding rejection and the number of multipliers. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Hybrid microgrids containing both renewable and conventional power sources are becoming increasingly attractive for a variety of reasons. However, intermittency of renewable power production and uncertainty in future load prediction increase risks of electric grid instability and, by consequence, restrict the portion of renewable power production in microgrids. In order, to prefigure the upcoming renewable power production, particularly, wind power and photovoltaic power, we suggest using weather forecasts. In addition to illustrating short term renewable power prediction based on ensemble weather forecasts, this paper focuses on optimizing the management of distributed power generation, power storage, and power exchange with the commercial electric grid. Establishing an optimal operating plan for the grid makes the integration of the predicted renewable production more efficient. The optimization problem is formulated as an integer linear program. The operating plan is initially optimized over the upcoming day and then regularly updated and incremented to cover a longer time horizon. After analyzing the obtained plans, we test and evaluate them relative to the observed weather conditions. Finally, we investigate some practical problems that had arisen and we apply a time cascade optimization technique to mitigate the effects of initial conditions and end-of-horizon effects, as well as to take advantage of updated forecasts. © 2020 Turkiye Klinikleri.

	abstract = {Compared with the conventional method utilizing permanent processing facilities, modular infrastructure has shown greater potential to hedge against the uncertainty due to the rapidly declining characteristic of shale gas production. However, there is still a lack of a comprehensive approach that integrates the production planning and the dynamic allocation of the modular infrastructure based on the production curve of shale gas wells. Therefore, a systematic optimization framework is developed to simultaneously optimize the production planning and modular infrastructure allocation over a given time horizon, maximizing the net present value (NPV) of the system, considering the production curve and gas well status, the processing capacity as well as the scheduling of modular infrastructure. The proposed mixed-integer linear programming model combines the decisions relevant to shale gas production, transportation, and processing together with the decisions regarding modular infrastructure, including allocation, capacity selection, installment planning, moving scheduling, and salvage operation. A case study deciding a development strategy for 24 multi-well pads over a period of 15 years is implemented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model. The results show that the dynamic allocation of the modular infrastructure can adapt to productivity fluctuations. The use of the modular approach increases the NPV by 9.12% and has a high utilization efficiency of processing devices compared to the conventional method. This work reveals that the synergistic interaction of the production planning and modular infrastructure dynamic allocation can increase efficiencies in the uses of energy, resources, and human capital to promote cleaner production practices. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The paper examines the complexity of assigning multiple breaks to shifts in the context of large-scale tour scheduling. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is presented that includes shift and days-off scheduling along with break assignments for a multi-skilled workforce. To achieve tractability, a two-stage decomposition procedure is proposed that separates the tour scheduling problem (TShP) from the break assignment problem (BAP). The former MIP is first solved to determine the shifts and days off for the workforce that minimize labor and shortages costs over the planning horizon. The results are used as input to a second MIP that optimally places the breaks to minimize the costs of working hours and uncovered periods. Three implicit BAP formulations are investigated. To better understand the literature and the models previously developed, a 3-field break classification scheme is introduced. The first field characterizes the number of breaks permitted per shift, the second specifies whether the length of the breaks is fixed or variable, and the third limits their position in a shift. A complexity analysis of the resulting 12 BAPs along with a few special cases is also included. Most problems are shown to be strongly NP-hard. Computations are presented for a wide variety of scenarios for both the TShP and the BAP using data provided by a European airport ground handler company. In all, over 500 instances were investigated using high and low demand fluctuation curves and the various break and shift flexibility options. The results indicate that increasing flexibility in break regulations can make a significant difference in coverage, but the degree depends on the underlying structure of the demand curve as well as on the types of shifts permitted. Formulations with the most flexible shift and break regulations reduced undercoverage by up to 16.68% compared to the most common scenarios in which shifts are limited to a single lunch break. © 2020, The Author(s).},

This paper addresses the distributed flexible job shop scheduling problem (DFJSP) with minimizing energy consumption. To solve the problem, firstly, a novel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed to solve small-scaled problems to optimality. Due to the NP-hardness of DFJSP, we then propose an efficient hybrid shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (HSFLA) for solving DFJSP, particularly for large-sized problems. HSFLA combines the shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA) with powerful global search ability and variable neighborhood search (VNS) with good local search ability. Moreover, in HSFLA, the encoding method, the decoding method, the initialization method and the memetic evolution process are specifically designed. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed MILP model and HFSLA. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.. All rights reserved.},

Each manufacturer within this network assembles a component from a series of sub-components received from other manufacturers and, due to high qualification standards, each sub-component of the manufacturer is single-sourced. Our motivating industries for this problem are defense aircraft and biopharmaceutical manufacturing. We develop scheduling decision rules that are applied locally at each manufacturer and are proven to optimize two industry-relevant global recovery metrics: (i) minimizing the maximum tardiness of any order of the final product of the MEASC network, and (ii) and minimizing the time to recover from the disruptive event. Our approaches are applied to a data set based on an industrial partner’s supply chain to show their applicability as well as their advantages over Integer Programming (IP) models. The developed decision rules are proven to be optimal, faster, and more robust than the equivalent IP formulations. In addition, they provide conditions under which local manufacturer decisions will lead to globally optimal recovery efforts. These decision rules can help managers to make better production and shipping decisions to optimize the recovery after disruptions and quantitatively test the impact of different pre-event mitigation strategies against potential disruptions. They can be further useful in MEASCs with or expecting a large amount of backorders. © 2019, © 2019 “IISE”.},

The goal of this paper is to maximize the system throughput by jointly optimizing the 3D UAV trajectory, communication scheduling, and UAV-AP/SN transmit power. We first consider a special case where the UAV-BS and UAV-AP trajectories are pre-determined. Although the resulting problem is an integer and non-convex optimization problem, a globally optimal solution is obtained by applying the polyblock outer approximation (POA) method based on the problem's hidden monotonic structure. Subsequently, for the general case considering the 3D UAV trajectory optimization, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to alternately optimize the divided sub-problems based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design is able to achieve significant system throughput gain over the benchmarks. In addition, the SCA-based method can achieve nearly the same performance as the POA-based method with much lower computational complexity.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In most demand response (DR) based residential load management systems, shifting a considerable amount of load in low price intervals reduces end user cost, however, it may create rebound peaks and user dissatisfaction. To overcome these problems, this work presents a novel approach to optimizing load demand and storage management in response to dynamic pricing using machine learning and optimization algorithms. Unlike traditional load scheduling mechanisms, the proposed algorithm is based on finding suggested low tariff area using artificial neural network (ANN). Where the historical load demand individualized power consumption profiles of all users and real time pricing (RTP) signal are used as input parameters for a forecasting module for training and validating the network. In a response, the ANN module provides a suggested low tariff area to all users such that the electricity tariff below the low tariff area is market based. While the users are charged high prices on the basis of a proposed load based pricing policy (LBPP) if they violate low tariff area, which is based on RTP and inclining block rate (IBR). However, we first developed the mathematical models of load, pricing and energy storage systems (ESS), which are an integral part of the optimization problem. Then, based on suggested low tariff area, the problem is formulated as a linear programming (LP) optimization problem and is solved by using both deterministic and heuristic algorithms. The proposed mechanism is validated via extensive simulations and results show the effectiveness in terms of minimizing the electricity bill as well as intercepting the creation of minimal-price peaks. Therefore, the proposed energy management scheme is beneficial to both end user and utility company. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we address a hybrid flow-shop scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing the makespan and the cost of delay. The concerned problem considers the diversity of the customers' requirements, which influences the procedures of the productions and increases the complexity of the problem. The features of the problem are inspired by the real-world situations, and the problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming model in the paper. In order to tackle the concerned problem, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm with Differential Evolution (DE) and Local Search (LS) (denoted by DE-LS) has been proposed in the paper. The differential evolution is a state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithm which can solve complex optimization problem in an efficient way and has been applied in many fields, especially in flow-shop scheduling problem. Moreover, the study not only combines the DE and LS, but also modifies the mutation process and provides the novel initialization process and correction strategy of the approach. The proposed DE-LS has been compared with four variants of algorithms in order to justify the improvements of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results show that the superiority and robustness of the proposed algorithm have been verified. © 2020 Yingjia Sun and Xin Qi.},

In order to obtain a reasonable energy prices and optimize the day-ahead scheduling scheme under the premise of considering the interests of both supply and demand, an interactive equilibrium model considering electricity-gas energy distribution system and integrated load aggregators is established in this paper. In the upper level, the integrated energy distribution network (IEDN) maximizes the profit via solving the day-ahead optimal energy flow considering energy prices changing in the next day. In the lower level, integrated load aggregators (ILA) minimize charging costs, thus optimizing energy distribution based on integrated demand responses. By using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions and the duality theorem of linear programming, the master-slave game model is transformed into a single layer optimization problem. To solve this problem, second-order cone programming (SOCP) and penalty convex-concave procedure (PCCP) are used to deal with the non-convex functions of electricity-gas distribution system. Therefore, the proposed model is approximated by a mixed-integer second-order cone programming problem. Finally, case studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and method. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {At present, most urban rail transit systems adopt an operation mode with a single long routing. The departure frequency is determined by the maximum section passenger flow. However, when the passenger flow varies greatly within different sections, this mode will lead to a low load factor in some sections, resulting in a waste of capacity. In view of this situation, this paper develops a nonlinear integer programming model to determine an optimal timetable with a balanced scheduling mode, where the wasted capacity at a constant departure frequency can be reduced with a slight increase in passenger waiting time. Then, we simplify the original model into a single-objective integer optimization model through normalization. A genetic algorithm is designed to find the optimal solution. Finally, a numerical example is presented based on real-world passenger and operation data from Beijing Metro Line 4. The results show that the double-routing optimization model can reduce wasted capacity by 9.5%, with a 4.5% increase in passenger waiting time, which illustrates the effectiveness of this optimization model. © 2019 by the authors.},

This study designs a high-freedom responsive feeder transit (HFRFT) system to serve at the transfer station, given vehicle routes, departure time, and service area based on demand. The proposed feeder transit system employs a travelling mode with multitype vehicles. In order to improve the operation of the HFRFT system, the optimization design methods are suggested for vehicle routes, scheduling, and service area. A mixed integer programming model and its hybrid of a metaheuristic algorithm are proposed to efficiently and integrally solve the vehicle routes and scheduling parameters according to the reservation requirements. A heuristic method is proposed to optimize the service area based on the equilibrium of system supply and demand. Case studies show that the mixed running mode of multiple models can significantly improve the seat utilization, which can also significantly reduce the number of departures and the average travel distance per passenger.

	abstract = {The increasing development of renewable energy sources requires more flexible technologies to be applied in building energy systems and a flexible controlled resource for the power grid. This work focuses on investigating the flexibility potential of building thermal storage and battery energy storage. Firstly, an autoregressive model with exogenous inputs is proposed to forecast the dynamic cooling demand and, based on that, a mixed integer linear model is formulated to optimize the dispatch of building energy systems with minimal operating costs. A factory building located in Huizhou, China is used as a case study. The results show that the ARX model can accurately predict the thermal load hourly. The model's level of fit is above 81%. The optimization objectives influence the development of the flexibility potential when building thermal storage and battery energy storage are considered. In this work, the economic objective is applied first to discuss the flexibility potential. The results show that, in this studied case, the operational cost decreased by 5.3% by using battery energy storage and further decreased by 4.0% by using building thermal storage. However, the results also reveal that unilaterally pursuing minimal operational costs results in larger peak valley difference of feeder power. The peak-valley difference of the feeder power increased from 714 kW to 1245 kW and 1689 kW respectively when the battery energy storage and building thermal storage were employed for the economic dispatch of the building energy system. Therefore, this work retests the flexibility potential of battery energy storage and building thermal storage by adding a constraint for feeder power difference. The results show that the operational costs can be still reduced greatly without damaging the stability of the power feeder. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Renewable surplus power is increasing due to the increasing penetration of these intermittent resources. In practice, electric grid operators either curtail the surplus energy resulting from renewable-based generations or utilize energy storage resources to absorb it. In this paper, we propose a framework for utilizing water pumps and tanks in water supply networks to absorb the surplus electrical energy resulting from renewable-based electricity generation resources in the electrical grid. We model water supply networks analytically, and propose a two-step procedure that utilizes the water tanks in the water supply network to harvest the surplus energy from an electrical grid. In each step, the water network operator needs to solve an optimization problem that is nonconvex. To compute optimal pump schedules and water flows, we develop a second-order cone relaxation and an approximation technique that enable us to transform the proposed problems into mixed-integer second-order cone programs. We then provide the conditions under which the proposed relaxation is exact, and present an algorithm for constructing an exact solution to the original problem from a solution to the relaxed problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework via numerical simulations. © 2014 IEEE.},

At the same time, distributed renewable energy resources are being deployed in distribution networks with increasing penetration rate. In this paper, a two-stage optimal scheduling method is proposed for distribution system with high photovoltaic penetration. The proposed scheduling method is decomposed into two stages to alleviate intra-day random variations of PV generation, electricity prices, and end-user load. In the day-ahead stage, this paper employs a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) method to achieve coordinated control of air conditioning loads, solar photovoltaic (PV) resources and battery energy storage systems (BESSs) under the target of minimizing system overall operation costs. A novel two-parameter lumped thermal model is introduced to more accurately describe the thermal dynamic process of the buildings, which is critical to meet the end users’ thermal comfort in control process. In the real-time stage, a rolling horizon optimization approach is applied for minimization of imbalance costs between the day-ahead energy market and real-time energy market. Simulations are conducted on a radial distribution network, whose results verify that the proposed method can effectively reduce operation cost, lower peak demand and improve the PV penetration level in the distribution network. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

To enhance the optimal operation of power plants, we propose a coordinated optimal operation strategy of generation and coal management in this paper. Uncertainties in electricity prices and demands, coal prices, and coal inventory holding costs are captured and modeled by discrete scenarios. Emission constraints are introduced to control generation emissions. The heat loss caused by the weathering of coal during the storage is taken into account, which distinguishes the considered co-optimization problem from the previous ones. The proposed strategy is built on a mixed-integer linear programming-typed two-stage stochastic programming model, in which whether to purchase coal is determined in the first stage and the quantity of coal purchase, the coal inventory, and the economic generation dispatch are determined in the second stage. The objective is to maximize the expected profits.

In cases where load-shifting is not a viable option for cost reduction, battery storage systems used for peak shaving purposes are emerging as a promising solution. In this paper, the economic benefits of implementing battery storage into an existing grid-connected photovoltaic system for a medium-scale swimming facility is studied. The objective is to minimize the total cost of electricity for the facility, including the cost of energy and peak power demand, while ensuring the longevity of the battery. An optimization model based on multi-integer linear programming is built, and simulated using a one-year time horizon in GAMS and Matlab. The main results reveal that installing a battery storage system is economically attractive today, with net savings on the total system cost of 0.64% yearly. The cost of peak power is reduced by 13.9%, and the savings from peak shaving operation alone is enough to compensate for the yearly cost of the battery. Moreover, the battery ensures additional revenue by performing price arbitrage operations. When simulating the system for an assumed 2030 scenario, the battery is found to be more profitable with a yearly net savings of 4.15%. © 2019 MDPI AG. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Conventional mine planning approaches use an estimated orebody model as input to generate optimal production schedules. The smoothing effect of some geostatistical estimation methods cause most of the mine plans and production forecasts to be unrealistic and incomplete. With the development of simulation methods, the risks from grade uncertainty in ore reserves can be measured and managed through a set of equally probable orebody realizations. In order to incorporate grade uncertainty into the strategic mine plan, a stochastic mixed integer programming (SMIP) formulation is presented to optimize an underground cut-and-fill mining production schedule. The objective function of the SMIP model is to maximize the net present value (NPV) of the mining project and minimize the risk of deviation from the production targets. To demonstrate the applicability of the SMIP model, a case study on a cut-and-fill underground gold mining operation is implemented. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Internet of energy based smart power grids demonstrate high in-feed from renewable energy resources (RESs) and lofty out-feed to energy consumers. Uncertainties evolved by incorporating RESs and time-varying energy consumption present immense challenges to the optimal control of smart power networks. To deal with these challenges, it is important to make the system deterministic by making time-ahead prediction and scheduling of power supply and demand. The present work confers a model of a co-scheduling framework, organizing cost-efficient activation of energy supply entities (ESEs) and load demands in a home area power network (HAPN). It integrates roof-top photovoltaic (PV) panels, diesel energy generator (DE), energy storage devices (ESDs), and smart load demands (SLDs) along with grid-supplied power. The scheduling model is based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework, incorporates a 'min-max' optimization algorithm that reduces the daily energy bills, maintains high comfort level for the energy consumers, and increases the self-sufficiency of the home. The proposed strategy exploits the flexibility in dynamic energy price signals and SLDs of various classes, providing day-ahead cost-optimal scheduling decisions for incorporated energy entities. A linearized component-based model is developed, considering inefficiencies, taking various power phase modes of the SLDs along with the cost of operation, maintenance, and degradation of the equipment. A case study based on numerical analysis determines the particular features of the proposed HAPN model. Simulation results demonstrate the real prospect of our implemented strategy, utilizing a cost-effective optimal blend of distinct energy entities in a smart home. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This article addresses an appointment scheduling problem in which the server responds to congestion of the service system. Using waiting time as a proxy for how far behind schedule the server is running, we characterize the congestion-induced behavior of the server as a function of a customer’s waiting time. Decision variables are the scheduled arrival times for a specific sequence of customers. The objective of our model is to minimize a weighted cost incurred for a customer’s waiting time, server overtime and server speedup in response to congestion. We provide alternative formulations of this problem as a Simulation Optimization (SO) model and a Stochastic Integer Programming (SIP) model, respectively. We show that the SIP model can solve moderate-sized instances exactly under certain assumptions about a server (Formula presented.) s response to congestion. We further show that the SO model achieves near-optimal solutions for moderate-sized problems while also being able to scale up to much larger problem instances. We present theoretical results for both models and we carry out a series of experiments to illustrate the characteristics of the optimal schedules and to measure the importance of accounting for a server (Formula presented.) s response to congestion when scheduling appointments using a case study for an outpatient clinic at a large medical center. Finally, we summarize the most important managerial insights obtained from this study. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 “IISE”.},

	abstract = {Various optimization problems result from the introduction of nonlinear terms into combinatorial optimization problems. In the context of energy optimization for example, energy sources can have very different characteristics in terms of power range and energy demand/cost function, also known as efficiency function or energy conversion function. Introducing these energy sources characteristics in combinatorial optimization problems, such as energy resource allocation problems or energy-consuming activity scheduling problems may result into mixed integer nonlinear problems neither convex nor concave. Approximations via piecewise linear functions have been proposed in the literature. Non-convex optimization models and heuristics exist to compute optimal breakpoint positions under a bounded absolute error-tolerance. We present an alternative solution method based on the upper and lower bounding of nonlinear terms using non necessarily continuous piecewise linear functions with a relative epsilon-tolerance. Conditions under which such approach yields a pair of mixed integer linear programs with a performance guarantee are analyzed. Models and algorithms to compute the non necessarily continuous piecewise linear functions with absolute and relative tolerances are also presented. Computational evaluations performed on energy optimization problems for hybrid electric vehicles show the efficiency of the method with regards to the state of the art. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The fast-growing development of smart grid and renewable energy increases the challenge in balancing the production on local energy consumption. The power scheduling of energy storage has directed to growing interests in energy storage system to increase the use of renewables. In this study, a practical laboratory energy management system considering renewable energy and battery is established. Besides, two control strategies including ‘scheduling’ and ‘ON/OFF’ operation of the grid in the photovoltaic–wind–battery hybrid systems are modeled. This paper proposes a day-ahead optimizing planning using mixed-integer linear programming, aiming to achieve economic benefit by reducing operational costs of the grid. Related to demand-side management, a control technique is developed for a proper scheduling of the power from the hybrid system. The ultimate objective of the aimed strategy is to maximize the advantages of renewable energy in different running conditions such as weather fluctuation and grid support. In addition, a day-ahead optimization for operational costs, as well as a prediction model for PV and WT, is used. The data of renewable productions and load demand are used. The obtained results prove that applying the scheduling strategy for PV–WT–battery and grid operation control models, significant grid decreasing can be achieved related to the case where the grid is managed alone to satisfy the same load demand. © 2019, Brazilian Society for Automatics--SBA.},

	abstract = {Integrated optimization of the procurement cost of electric energy with production planning is increasingly considered in various industries. The traditional approach in industry is production driven, i.e. the production is scheduled first, followed by the energy supply optimization to find the best available energy portfolio, which is usually sub-optimal. The combined scheduling and energy procurement optimization can be formulated as an integrated monolithic optimization model, resulting in intractable problems, even if solutions to the two isolated problems are available. We propose to use Mean Value Cross Decomposition for solving the combined problem by iterating between energy-aware production scheduling and energy-cost optimization, possibly building on existing solutions. We apply the approach to a pulping process and a steel production process. MILP-based models are employed for the two scheduling problems and for the energy cost optimization a Minimum-Cost Flow Network model is used, resulting in good quality solutions within reasonable computation times. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the MicroGrid environment, the high penetration of uncertain energy sources such as solar Photovoltaics (PVs), Energy Storage Systems (ESSs), Demand Response (DR) programs, Vehicles to Grid (V2G or G2V) and Electricity Markets make the Energy Resource Management (ERM) problem highly complex. All such complexities should be addressed while maximizing income and minimizing the total operating costs of aggregators that accumulate all types of available energy resources from the MicroGrid system. Due to the presence of mixed-integer, discrete variables and non-linear network constraints, it is sometimes very difficult to solve such problem using traditional optimization methods. This paper proposes a new metaheuristic optimization technique entitled the 'Enhanced Velocity Differential Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization' (EVDEPSO) algorithm to tackle the ERM problem. Its key feature is the updation of the Velocity by the terms named as Enhanced Velocity, Cooperation and Stochastic Uni-Random Distribution and position by the term Deceleration Factor. The performance of the proposed method is measured by a case study comprises of 100 scenarios of a 25-bus MicroGrid with high penetration of aforementioned energy sources. IEEE Computational Intelligence Society organized the competition on the above mentioned problem, in which EVDEPSO secured a second rank. The results of EVDEPSO are compared with the competition participated optimization algorithms. It also compared with well-known optimization algorithms such as Variable Neighborhood Search and Differential Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization. The comparison results show that the performance of EVDEPSO is superior in terms of the Ranking Index (R.I) and Average Ranking Index (A.R.I) as compared to the aforementioned algorithms. For effective comparative analysis of algorithms, standard statistical test named as One-Way ANOVA and Tukey Test is used. The results of this test also prove the effectiveness of EVDEPSO algorithm as compared to all tested algorithms. © 2013 IEEE.},

This new variant is an extension of the vehicle routing problems with time windows and synchronization constraints (VRPTW-S) that is well-studied in literature. We present a Mixed Integer Programming method, and propose three Variable Neighborhood Search approaches. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of the General Variable Neighborhood Search with Ejection Chains-based local search for solving VRPTW-TD-2MS and VRPTW-S. © 2018 The Authors.

	abstract = {This contribution presents the modeling and optimization of the operation of production plants that are coupled via distribution networks and applies it to a part of the petrochemical production site of INEOS in Köln in Germany. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear problem and solved to generate an optimal monthly plan for a set of plants, tanks, and loading/unloading facilities, while respecting various constraints arising from technical limitations, physical couplings between the plants, production targets, and the schedule for import and export across the company borders via ships and trains. The optimization problem takes into account varying energy prices, the influence of the ambient temperature on the processes, and the inventory management for different types of storages. We solve the optimization problem for the particular case and compare the results for a 1 month scenario to recorded data and show that a significant energy saving potential exists. We discuss the current limitations and outline potential improvements in the context of the application of the optimization model to optimal site planning that leads to an improved coordination of the production in the process industries. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The advancement of integrated millimeter-wave products opens the possibility of leveraging communications in 60-GHz band to meet the unprecedented traffic demand in WLAN. Despite the vast bandwidth available, millimeter-wave signals suffer from high attenuation and weak diffraction ability. Therefore, wireless communication at 60 GHz is characterized by the inherent directivity and susceptibility to blockage. Multiple Access Point (AP) architecture is proposed for 60-GHz WLAN to enhance spatial reuse and survive blockage. In the presence of multiple APs in the network, this paper addresses the important problem of user-AP association and resource allocation. We study three schemes of different complexity and investigate how to maximize user throughput with joint consideration of AP assignment and transmission scheduling. To solve the formulated problem, we propose a branch-And-cut-based solution procedure. We perform a detailed comparative analysis of the three schemes and advocate to use one-shot AP assignment-based scheduling scheme due to its simplicity and good performance. To deal with real-Time traffic and human blockage, we propose an online algorithm to implement the one-shot AP assignment-based scheme to avoid frequent service disruption. Our results show that the proposed online algorithm is competitive when compared with the optimal offline algorithm. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

The short-term schedule of these vessels is subject to uncertainties inherent to its operations, resulting in ships idleness or delays in oil production. The objective of this study is to develop methods to support a Brazilian oil and gas company in overcoming impacts caused by operational disruptions, while reaching its planned production level. The PLSV rescheduling problem was treated as an identical parallel machine scheduling problem, where the machines represent the vessels and the jobs are the activities for the subsea well connections. We propose a mathematical programming model and a method based on the iterated local search (ILS) metaheuristic to solve the problem. This paper contributes to this by considering simultaneously setup times, machine eligibility, release dates, due dates, and machine availability. Both methods were applied on 10 instances based on real PLSV data. Taking into account an objective function that measures the operational impact on schedules, the ILS provided an average improvement above 91% in schedules when compared to the initial solution provided by the studied company. The ILS outperformed a mathematical programming model for the problem, in eight instances, within a 30-minute execution time limit, fitting to the company process. © 2018 The Authors.

	abstract = {Redox Flow Battery (RFB) systems are promising technologies for the multi-hour electrical energy storage that will be necessary for on-demand electricity supply based on wind and solar power. Deriving maximum value from a RFB requires optimisation of both the system design and its operation. In this work three novel algebraic modelling approaches are introduced to represent RFB operation more accurately while maintaining quick optimisation times. First the typical linear programming (LP) optimisation problem is re-posed in terms of current-density rather than power, allowing voltaic losses to be expressed as a quadratic function (QP). Secondly, it is then shown that the current-density framework supports a novel constraint for the avoidance of high cell voltage that may damage the stack. Thirdly, for the first time a binary variable (MIQP) to describe active/idle states is introduced. This allows coulombic leakage and pumping losses to be modelled as fixed terms without constantly draining the RFB, and it allows for the optimisation of pump rating in a VRFB. In a day-ahead energy management case study, it is found that the QP optimisation predicts an additional 19% annual revenue when compared to the LP optimisation. This capture of the true flexibility of the RFB operation allows its full value to be assessed, and therefore advances the case for their deployment within the energy system. Furthermore, the formulations developed are not only applicable to RFBs but to the scheduling of other battery systems, particularly Li–ion, and balance of plant optimisation, such as the sizing of inverters and climate control systems in the context of parasitic losses. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The uncertainty of flight departing time mainly stems from delays and traffic control. Airlines specifics the minimum and target number of staff for each flight task in each time period. Taking uncertain tasks starting time into account and introducing risk measure (e.g., conditional value-at-risk) into optimization objective function, we present a risk-averse two-stage stochastic model with the mixed-integer recourse that minimizes both staffing costs and risk measurement to respond the time uncertainty. The first-stage decision is to make personal-area allocation plan; and the particular personnel-task scheduling decisions are determined in the second stage as the actual flight departing times are realized. To solve the NP-hard problem, a progressive hedging algorithm is proposed. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach as compared with a sample average approximation method. Finally, we utilize a real-world case to illustrate how the proposed method can be used to obtain a near-optimal solution for practical problem. © 2013 IEEE.},

In this paper, a risk-based coordination model of maintenance scheduling and unit commitment is established and the objective is to minimize the total operation cost consisting of the maintenance cost, generation cost and risk cost. A random generation method is proposed to obtain line failure scenarios based on arbitrary failure rate functions. In the base case, security constraints must be satisfied while the potential overflow caused by line outages is calculated in contingency scenarios. In order to handle this mixed integer quadratic programming, a solving strategy based on three-layer iterations is applied. In the exterior iterative layer, Lagrangian relaxation technology is used to coordinate the maintenance scheduling and the risk-based unit commitment until the maintenance schedule is available for the optimized unit commitment plan. In other two iterative layers, Benders decomposition method is adopted to the further problem decomposition. In the middle layer, iterations between the unit commitment sub-problem and the risk-based dispatch sub-problem are used to guarantee the optimality of risk-based unit commitment. In interior iterations, the feasibility of unit commitment plan is checked by an optimal load shedding model. Case studies are performed on a 6-bus test system and a 118-bus test system. Results show that the total operation cost decreases by coordination while the system operating risk can be effectively controlled. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In well-managed coordinated networked microgrids (MGs) besides electricity interchange between MGs, global optimisation is fulfilled. Here the authors studied a networked MG architecture, in which the control centre of microgrids communicates with a distribution network operator (DNO) to fulfil their local requirements. However, communication signals are always vulnerable to cyberattacks. While the surplus/deficit powers are reported by one MG to DNO, other MGs can act as potential cyber attackers aimed at decreasing their own costs. This action may also lead to threat the global optimisation of networked MGs. When an attacker manipulates the signal sent from the attacked MG to DNO, it will result in a false power interchange schedule produced by DNO. The attacker MG in the next step, maliciously accesses and changes the signal sent from the DNO to the attacked MG. In case a successful attack executed, the operation cost of the attacker MG will be decreased. Furthermore, a game-theoretic model of attacker-defender interaction is proposed, while different behaviours of players are addressed. The optimal scheduling scheme of MGs is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and solved by CPLEX. Simulation results show the impacts of the attacks and importance of the defend strategies. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of improving the integration between passenger timetabling and track maintenance scheduling. We propose a microscopic optimization model and an iterative algorithm for solving this problem efficiently. Block sections are considered as the basic microscopic elements for train movements in a railway network. A mixed-integer linear programming formulation is proposed for the integrated optimization problem in which train timing, sequencing and routing are the timetabling variables, while timing and sequencing of maintenance tasks are the track maintenance variables. The objective function is to minimize the total train travel time and the maintenance tardiness cost. The constraints proposed in this work address the practical specifications of the INFORMS RAS 2016 Problem Solving Competition (2016 PSC). In this context, the main decision variables are the entrance and exit times of the trains on each block section plus the start and end times of each maintenance task. Since the integrated optimization problem is strongly NP-hard, an iterative algorithm is proposed to compute near-optimal solutions in a short computation time. The algorithm is based on a decomposition of the overall problem into sub-problems related to train scheduling and/or routing with or without track maintenance task scheduling. The connecting information between the two sub-problems concerns the selected train routes plus the start and end times of the maintenance tasks. Computational experiments are performed on a set of realistic railway instances, which were introduced during the 2016 PSC. The iterative algorithm outperforms a standard MILP solver and the first-place team of this competition in terms of both solution quality and time to deliver the new best-known solutions. The scalability of the iterative algorithm is investigated when increasing the number of trains and track maintenance tasks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In recent years, the environmental pollutions at the Three Gorges Dam have become an increasingly concerning issue of the Chinese government. One of the most significant environmental problems is the carbon emissions from the lockage operations at the two ship locks of the Three Gorges Dam. Currently, due to the large amount of vessels passing through the dam, there is always a long queue of vessels on both sides and the average waiting time is long. This has further lead to an increased amount of fuel consumption and carbon emissions. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop a decision-support model for a better navigation scheduling and planning of the lockage operations at the Three Gorges Dam. This paper proposed an improved mixed integer non-linear programming model for the green lock scheduling problem at the Three Gorges Dam. The model aims at minimizing the carbon emissions and the waiting time in the lockage process through scheduling the vessels in a fairer and more efficient manner. Moreover, a greedy particle swarm optimization (G-PSO) algorithm is developed to solve the complex optimization problem. The proposed mathematical model and algorithm are validated through a numerical experiment. The result shows that it may lead to a significant reduction on carbon emissions by giving a specified speed to each vessel with a pre-optimized sequence. Meanwhile, the fairness and efficiency of the lockage process may also be improved. © 2019 by the authors.},

A mathematical model using integer linear programming is developed to determine the optimal schedule considering several constraints such as the availability of vessels and planning delays. As the decommissioning problem is challenging to solve, a matheuristic approach based on the hybridisation of a heuristic approach and an exact method is also proposed to find near optimal solutions for a test set of problems.

The ever-increasing data traffic has exacerbated energy consumption on both cellular service providers and mobile users. It has become an urgent need to reducing the energy consumption in the cellular network while satisfying users' increasing traffic demands. Mobile data offloading is an effective energy-saving paradigm to tackle the above-mentioned problem. However, the current approaches cannot fully address the issue in terms of user demands and offloaded traffic. With the observation that duplicated data transmission often happens in the crowd with similar social interests, we deploy device-to-device D2D data offloading to achieve the energy efficiency at the user side while adapting their increasing traffic demands. Specifically, we investigate the stochastic optimization of the long-term time-averaged expected energy consumption while guaranteeing the strong stability of the network by utilizing the social-aware and energy-efficient D2D mobile offloading. By jointly considering interference among D2D users, social-aware caching, link scheduling, and routing, an offline finite-queue-aware energy minimization problem is formulated, which is a time-coupling stochastic mixed-integer non-linear programming MINLP problem. We propose an online finite-queue-aware energy algorithm by employing the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty theory. Extensive analysis and simulations are conducted to validate the proposed scheme. © 2019 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {There exists a wide variety of network problems where several connection requests occur simultaneously. In general, each request is attended by finding a route in the network, where the origin and destination of such a route are those hosts that wish to establish a connection for information exchange. As is well documented in the related literature, the exchange of information through disjoint routes increases the effective bandwidth, velocity, and the probability of receiving the corresponding information. The definition of disjoint paths may refer to nodes, edges, or both. One of the most studied variants is the one where disjointness implies not to share edges. This optimization problem is usually known as the maximum edge-disjoint paths problem. This NP -hard optimization problem has applications in real-time communications, very large scale integration design, scheduling, bin packing, or load balancing. The proposed approach hybridizes an integer linear programming formulation of the problem with an evolutionary algorithm. Empirical results using 174 previously reported instances show that the proposed procedure compares favorably to previous metaheuristics for this problem.

	abstract = {Recent complexities in interconnected power system operation call for more efficient and fast approaches for operational problems including network-constrained unit commitment (NCUC). In this study, an algorithm called period-elimination Benders decomposition (PEBD) is proposed to enhance the computational efficiency of AC NCUC problems. After linearising the AC NCUC, two subproblems (SPs) are defined to ensure power balance at buses as well as constraints of branches and inter-regional transactions. In the classical Benders decomposition (BD), all time periods are solved at all iterations up to convergence. However, in the proposed PEBD, a time period that satisfies a SP in an iteration is eliminated from the solution procedure of that SP at next iterations. After both SPs are satisfied for all time periods, the solution is checked for interrelation constraints and a few more iterations may be needed to finalise the solution. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed PEBD method are verified by examining it on two test systems. It is found that the PEBD greatly enhances the speed of NCUC, especially in larger power systems due to eliminating unnecessary calculations for satisfied time periods. © 2019 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the scheduling of real-time periodic tasks executed on heterogeneous multicore platforms. Each processor is composed of a set of multi-speed cores with limited energy resources. A reconfigurable system is sensible to unpredictable reconfiguration events from related environment, such as the activation, removal or update of tasks. The problem is to handle feasible reconfiguration scenarios under energy constraints. Since any task can finish execution before achieving its worst-case execution time (WCET), the idea is to distribute this execution on different processor cores for meeting related deadlines and reducing energy consumption. The methodology consists in using lower processor speeds first to consume less energy. If the system is still non-feasible after reconfiguration, then we adjust the task periods as a flexible solution or migrate some of them to the least loaded processors. Accordingly, an integer linear program (ILP) is formulated to encode the execution model that assigns tasks to different cores with optimal energy consumption, thereby realizing energy-efficient computing/green computing. The potency and effectiveness of the proposed approach are rated through simulation studies. By measuring the energy consumption cost, our solution offers better than 11% of gain than recently published methods and improves by 85% the overall number of adjusted periods. © 2013 IEEE.},

The model integrates the energy market-clearing process with a train routing problem, where a time-space network is used to describe the limitations of the rail transport network (RTN). Likewise, a price-sensitive shiftable (PSS) demand bidding approach is applied to increase the flexibility of the power grid operation and reduce carbon emissions in the system. The main objective of the proposed model is to determine the optimal hourly location, charge/discharge scheduling of the BEST system, power dispatch of thermal units, flexible loads scheduling as well as finding the locational marginal price (LMP) considering the daily carbon emission limit of thermal units. The proposed two-stage framework allows the market operator to differentiate between the risk level of all existing uncertainties and achieve a more flexible decision-making model. The operator can modify the conservatism degree of the market-clearing using a non-probabilistic method based on info-gap decision theory (IGDT), to reduce the effect of wind power fluctuations in real-time. In contrast, a risk-neutral-based stochastic technique is used to meet power demand uncertainty. The results of the proposed mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, confirm the potential of BEST and PSS demand in decreasing the LMP, line congestion, carbon emission, and daily operation cost.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Random job arrivals that happen frequently in manufacturing practice may create a need for dynamic scheduling. This paper considers an issue of how to reschedule the randomly arrived new jobs to pursue both performance and stability of a schedule in a job shop. Firstly, a mixed integer programming model is established to minimize three objectives, including the discontinuity rate of new jobs during the processing, the makespan deviation of initial schedule, and the sequence deviation on machines. Secondly, four match-up strategies from references are modified to determine the rescheduling horizon. Once new jobs arrive, the rescheduling process is immediately triggered with ongoing operations remain. The ongoing operations are treated as machine unavailable constraints (MUC) in the rescheduling horizon. Then, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with improvements is proposed to solve the dynamic job shop scheduling problem. Improvement strategies consist of a modified decoding scheme considering MUC, a population initialization approach by designing a new transformation mechanism, and a novel particle movement method by introducing position changes and a random inertia weight. Lastly, extensive experiments are conducted on several instances. The experiments results show that the modified rescheduling strategies are statistically and significantly better than the compared strategies. Moreover, comparative studies with five variants of PSO algorithm and three state-of-the-art meta-heuristics demonstrate the high performance of the improved PSO algorithm. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Generation maintenance scheduling (GMS) is one of the most important scheduling problems in the restructured power systems. The maintenance time interval of generation units is the crucial factor of GMS for an operation lifespan of generation units, particularly within the smart grid which needs high reliability. Accordingly, this study proposes a multi-objective-GMS (MO-GMS) optimisation model for maintenance scheduling of generation units based on the global criterion approach, adopting a suitable compromise function. The proposed MO-GMS model determines the maintenance intervals, aims to maximise both the generation company's (GenCo's) financial returns from selling electricity and the system reserve at every time interval from the independent system operator (ISO) standpoint. This method searches the optimal maintenance weeks for each generation unit, considering the objectives of both GenCo and ISO, simultaneously. The proposed MO-GMS model is formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem and examined on the IEEE 24-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems. The success of the proposed multi-objective model is validated by comparing the obtained results with intelligent optimisation algorithms. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

A feasible RCPSP solution consists of a time-ordered schedule of jobs with corresponding execution modes, respecting precedence and resources constraints. In this paper, we propose a cutting plane algorithm to separate five different cut families, as well as a new preprocessing routine to strengthen resource-related constraints. New lifted versions of the well-known precedence and cover inequalities are employed. At each iteration, a dense conflict graph is built considering feasibility and optimality conditions to separate cliques, odd-holes and strengthened Chvátal-Gomory cuts. The proposed strategies considerably improve the linear relaxation bounds, allowing a state-of-the-art mixed-integer linear programming solver to find provably optimal solutions for 754 previously open instances of different variants of the RCPSPs, which was not possible using the original linear programming formulations. © 2019},

Since there is a set of competing players with inherently conflicting objectives in the system under study such as the Distribution System Operator (DSO) and MG owners, a one-leader multi-follower-type bi-level optimization model is proposed. In this framework, the upper-level player as a leader minimizes the total cost from DSO’s point of view, while the lower-level players as multi-followers maximize the profit of MG owners. Since the resulting model is a non-linear bi-level optimization problem, it is transformed into a single-level mixed-integer second-order cone programming problem through Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. The satisfactory performance of the proposed model is investigated on a real-test system under different scenarios and working conditions. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {We consider a personalized employee scheduling problem with characteristics present in retail stores consisting of multiple departments. In the setting under study, each department generally covers its demand in employees over the planning horizon of a week by assigning shifts to its own staff. However, the employees can also be transferred to other departments under certain conditions for executing entire shifts or parts of shifts there. The transfer feature enables to improve the overall schedule quality considerably when compared to the nontransfer case. Given the complexity of the problem, we propose a three-phase decomposition-based heuristic. In the first phase, we consider each department separately and solve a simplified version of the mono-department scheduling problems. From the obtained solutions, we deduce inter-department shifts that could potentially reduce the overall cost. This is examined in the second phase by resolving the scheduling problem of the first phase where the deduced inter-department shifts are included. In this phase, however, we decompose the scheduling problem by time, looking at each day separately. From the obtained schedules, we then devise inter-department demand curves, which specify the number of transfers between departments over time. In the third phase, we decompose the initial scheduling problem into mono-department problems using these inter-department demand curves. Consequently, our approach makes it possible to solve mono-department optimization problems to get an overall schedule while still benefiting from the employee transfer feature. In all three phases, the scheduling problems are formulated as mixed-integer linear programs. We show through extensive computational experiments on instances with up to 25 departments and 1000 employees that the method provides high-quality solutions within reasonable computation times. © 2019, The Association of European Operational Research Societies and Springer-Verlag GmbH Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Critical infrastructure networks such as electric power, water distribution, natural gas, transportation and telecommunications are the backbone of modern societies as they provide them with the services that are essential for their continuous functioning. However, these infrastructure networks are not isolated from each other but instead, most of them rely on one another to be functional. Hence, they are highly vulnerable to any disruptive event (e.g., components deteriorating, terrorist attacks, or natural disasters) which makes their restoration more challenging task for decision makers. In this paper, we study the restoration problem of a system of interdependent infrastructure networks following a disruption event considering different disruptions scenarios. We propose a resilience-driven multi-objective restoration model using mixed-integer programming that aims to maximize the resilience of the system of interdependent infrastructure networks while minimizing the total cost associated with the restoration process. The restoration model considers the availability of limited time and resources and provides a prioritized list of components, nodes or links, to be restored along with assigning and scheduling them to the available work crews. The proposed model is illustrated through a generated system of interdependent power-water networks, however it is applicable to any physically interdependent networks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {A rolling-horizon algorithm is proposed for optimizing the operating schedule of a given cogeneration energy system while taking into account time-variable loads, tariffs and ambient conditions, as well as yearly fiscal incentives. The presented algorithm is based on the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model developed by the authors for optimizing the daily schedule of cogeneration systems and networks of heat and power plants. First the MILP model is extended to optimize the weekly operation schedule to better manage the heat-cold storage systems. However, in order to account for the European qualification framework for high efficiency cogeneration, as well as for country-specific incentive policies, it is necessary to consider average yearly-basis energy saving indexes, thus requiring to tackle the problem for the whole year. Since the extension of the MILP model from one day to seven days already increases remarkably the computational requirements, a simple application of the same optimization approach to a whole year would be practically unfeasible; therefore, this work proposes a rolling-horizon algorithm in which a sequence of weekly MILP submodels is solved, while considering production and consumption estimates based on demand profiles from historical data. The results obtained for a real-world test case are reported and discussed. © 2017},

	abstract = {Since the last decade, power systems have been evolving dynamically due to smart grid technologies. In this context, energy management and optimal scheduling of different resources are very important. The main objective of this paper is to study the optimal scheduling of distributed energy resources (OSDER) problem. This problem is a challenging, complex and very large-scale mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. Its complexity escalates with incorporation of uncertain and intermittent renewable sources, electric vehicles, variable loads and markets which makes it hard to be solved using traditional optimization algorithms and solvers. However, it can be handled efficiently and without approximation or modification of the original formulation using modern optimization algorithms such as metaheuristics. In this paper, an improved version of the variable neighborhood search (IVNS) algorithm is proposed to solve the OSDER problem. The proposed algorithm was tested on two large-scale centralized day-ahead energy resource scenarios. In the first scenario, the 12.66 kV, 33-bus test system with a total of 49,920 design variables is used whilst in the second scenario, the 30 kV, 180-bus test system is used with a total of 154,800 design variables. The optimization results using the proposed algorithm were compared with five existing optimization algorithms, i.e., chaotic biogeography-based optimization (CBBO), cross-entropy method and evolutionary PSO (CEEPSO), chaotic differential evolution with PSO (Chaotic-DEEPSO), Levy differential evolution with PSO (Levy-DEEPSO), and the variable neighborhood search (VNS). For the first test system, the IVNS has achieved a score of -5598.89 while for the second test system it has achieved a score of -3180.15. A comparative study of the results has shown that the proposed IVNS algorithm performs better than the remaining algorithms for both cases. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of collision avoidance among robots that follow pre-planned trajectories in a structured environment while minimizing the maximum traveling time among them. More precisely, we consider a discrete event formulation of this problem. Robots are modeled by automata, the environment is partitioned into a square grid where cells represent free space, obstacles and walls, which are modeled as shared resources among robots. The main contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a problem formulation based on mixed integer linear programming to compute an optimal schedule for the pre-planned trajectories. Second, we propose a heuristic method to compute a sub-optimal schedule: the computational complexity of this approach is shown to be polynomial with the number of robots and the dimension of the environment. Finally, simulations are provided to validate performance and scalability of the proposed approach. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The installation of offshore wind farms poses particular challenges due to expensive resources and quickly changing weather conditions. Model-based decision-support systems are required to achieve an efficient installation. In the literature, there exist several models for scheduling offshore operations, which focus on vessels but neglect the influence of resource restrictions at the base port and uncertainties involved with weather predictions. This article proposes a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model for the scheduling of installation activities, which handles several installation vessels as well as restrictions about available cargo bridges at the port. Additionally, the article explains how this model can be combined with a Model Predictive Control scheme to provide decision support for the scheduling of offshore installation operations. The article presents numerical studies of the effects induced by resource restrictions and of different parametrizations for this approach. Results show that even small planning windows, paired with comparably low computational times, achieve reasonably good results. Moreover, the results show that an increase in vessels comes at diminishing returns concerning the installation efficiency. Therefore, the results indicate that available good-weather windows primarily limit efficiency. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The low computational capacity of mobile devices has become the main performance bottleneck for emerging computing-intensive and delay-sensitive applications. In this paper, we propose a peer-to-peer (P2P) enhanced task scheduling framework to minimize the average task duration in device-to-device (D2D) enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) network by jointly optimizing the task scheduling decision and the computational resource allocation. Our proposed framework can work in different modes in different application scenarios. In the MEC mode, an iterative algorithm is presented based on alternating optimization technology and sorting algorithm, which can derive a near-optimal solution of the original mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) optimization problem. In the P2P mode, we can reformulate the original problem to a typical one-to-one assignment problem, which is solved by a task scheduling algorithm based on the Hungarian method. In more challenging hybrid mode, we make some simplifications based on reformulation linearization technology. Then, the near-optimal solution is obtained by our proposed scheduling algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method and difference of convex functions (D.C.) programming. Numerical results show that our proposed framework has shorter average task duration under different scheduling modes compared with the other scheduling schemes.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Movie scenes scheduling problem (MSSP) is the NP-hard. It refers to the process of film shooting through the reasonable sequence of film scenes to minimize the total cost of film shooting. Studying scheduling problem of this kind is based on the location of the scene shooting, the cost of the scene transfer, the different remuneration of actors, and the different duration of the film scene shooting. The actors' waiting time and transfer cost during the shooting process are reduced as much as possible to make the total film shooting cost smaller. In this paper, an ILP(integer linear programming) model is established and a TABU search based method (TSBM), a particle swarm optimization based method (PSOBM) and an ant colony based method (ACOBM) are used to study the movie scenes scheduling problem. The objective is to compare and analyze relation performances of the three methods in the problem. By compared the experiment, the results show that TSBM, PSOBM and ACOBM can effectively reduce the total cost of film shooting. Comparison with the experiments show that the optimization result of ACOBM is better, the running time of TSBM is shorter, and the optimization result of TSBM is better than that of PSOBM. In addition, the running time of ACOBM is faster than that of PSOBM by setting the number of ants and the number of particles. The potential application of this study has great relevance for the optimization and ILP. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With today’s massive jobs spanning thousands of tasks each, cost-optimality has become more important than ever. Modern distributed data processing paradigms can be significantly more sensitive to cost than makespan, especially for long jobs deployed in commercial clouds. This paper posits that minimized dollar costs can not be achieved unless data and tasks are scheduled simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce the problem of cost-efficient co-scheduling for highly data-intensive jobs in cloud, such as MapReduce. We show that while the problem is polynomial in some cases, its general problem is NP-Hard. We propose to tackle the problem by using integer programming techniques coupled with heuristic reduction and optimization to enable a near-realtime solution. AffordHadoop, a pluggable co-scheduler for Hadoop, is implemented as an example of such a co-scheduler. AffordHadoop can save up to 48 percent of the overall dollar costs when compared to existing schedulers and provides significant flexibility in fine-tuning the cost-performance tradeoff. © 2017 IEEE.},

However, the complexity of schedulability analysis techniques often makes it difficult to leverage existing optimization frameworks and scale to large designs. In this paper, we propose the concept of unschedulability core, a compact representation of the schedulability conditions, and develop efficient algorithms for its calculation. We present a new optimization framework that leverages such a concept. We show that this concept is applicable to a range of optimization problems, for example, when the decision variables include the task priority assignment and the selection of mechanisms protecting shared buffers. Experimental results on two case studies demonstrate that the new optimization procedure maintains the optimality of the solutions, but is a few orders of magnitude faster than other exact algorithms (branch-and-bound, integer linear programming). © 1968-2012 IEEE.},

The MILP model coordinates damage isolation, network reconfiguration, distributed generator re-dispatch, and crew/resource logistics. In addition, a framework for integrating different types of photovoltaic (PV) systems in the restoration process is developed. We consider two different types of crews, namely, line crews for damage repair and tree crews for obstacle removal. We also model the repair resource logistic constraints. Furthermore, a new algorithm is developed for solving the distribution system repair and restoration problem (DSRRP). The algorithm starts by solving DSRRP using an assignment-based method, then a neighborhood search method is designed to iteratively improve the solution. The proposed method is validated on modified IEEE 123- and 8500-bus distribution test systems. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

The decisions made in this section therefore produce significant effects on the overall performance of the hospital. Planning and scheduling of the surgeries in the operating rooms would obviously lead to the enhancement of the performance of the operating rooms. The setup time of the operating rooms is a very important factor in initiating next surgeries and consequently in the scheduling of elective patients. The preparation time is usually affected by the sequence of the surgeries, especially in critical and longer surgeries, such as open-heart surgeries. In this study, a two-stage procedure is applied to improve the performance of the open-heart surgical department. In the first stage, a mathematical model is proposed for planning and scheduling of the surgeries in the open-heart surgery ward, considering the sequence-dependent setup times. In the next stage, an estimation of the optimum number of intensive care unit beds is provided using the discrete event simulation method. Finally, using a real-life example, the applicability of the proposed model is demonstrated and an analysis of the effect of the recommended number of intensive care unit beds—extracted from the simulation model—on the performance of the surgical theater is performed. © The Author(s) 2018.},

	abstract = {Air traffic flow management is one of the most important operations in terminal airports heavily relying on advanced intelligence transportation techniques. This work considers a two-stage runway scheduling problem given a set of flights with uncertain arrival times. The first-stage problem is to identify a sequence of aircraft weight classes (e.g., Heavy, Large and Small) that minimizes runway occupying time (i.e., makespan). Then the second-stage decision is dedicated to scheduling the flights as punctually as possible after their arrival times realized, which translates into determining a sequence of flights for each aircraft category such that the total deviation time imposed on the flights is minimized. Instead of an exactly known probability distribution, information on uncertain parameters is limited (i.e., ambiguous), such as means, mean absolute deviations and support set of random parameters derived from historical data. Under this information on the random parameters, an ambiguous mixed-integer stochastic optimization model is proposed. For such a problem, we approximately construct a worst-case discrete probability distribution with three possible realizations per random parameter, and adopt a hybrid sample average approximation algorithm in which genetic algorithms are used to replace commercial solvers.

	abstract = {This paper investigates a fog computing-assisted multiuser simultaneous wireless information and power transfer network, where multiple sensors with power splitting (PS) receiver architectures receive information and harvest energy from a hybrid access point (HAP), and then process the received data by using local computing mode or fog offloading mode. For such a system, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the sensors' required energy while guaranteeing their required information transmissions and processing rates by jointly optimizing the multiuser scheduling, the time assignment, the sensors' transmit powers, and the PS ratios. Since, the problem is a mixed integer programming problem and cannot be solved with existing solution methods, we solve it by applying problem decomposition, variable substitutions, and theoretical analysis. For a scheduled sensor, the closed-form and semi-closed-form solutions to achieve its minimal required energy are derived, and then an efficient multiuser scheduling scheme is presented, which can achieve the suboptimal user scheduling with low computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate our obtained theoretical results, which show that for each sensor, when it is located close to the HAP or the fog server, the fog offloading mode is the better choice; otherwise, the local computing mode should be selected. The system performances in a frame-by-frame manner are also simulated, which show that using the energy stored in the batteries and that harvested from the signals transmitted by previous scheduled sensors can further decrease the total required energy of the sensors. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The unbalanced distribution of resource and consuming centers in China has prompted the AC/DC hybrid transmission technology. The maintenance scheduling of an AC/DC hybrid transmission network is the key technology to ensure its safety and reliability. In this study, the mutual influence mechanism of an AC/DC system in a maintenance period was analyzed in detail. The overhead transmission line and transformer are key equipment within an AC/DC hybrid transmission network, and an optimization model of the key equipment maintenance scheduling was established. The objective of the model was to improve the system reliability during the maintenance scheduling. By considering the constraints of maintenance cost, maintenance resources, and maintenance workload, the maintenance scheduling of overhead transmission lines and transformer branches was obtained. The over-limit situation of power flow and the weakness of the system during the maintenance period was evaluated. The “double-layer substitution method” was adopted to convert the nonlinear constraints into its bilinear formulation such that it could then be solved. The random number sampling method was used to quantify the system reliability, and the commercial optimization software was used to solve the optimized scheduling. Based on the improved IEEE RTS-79 system and the Hubei Province electrical system, the simulation results showed the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {As the numbers of microgrids (MGs) and prosumers are increasing, many research efforts are proposing various power sharing schemes for multiple MGs (MMGs). Power sharing between MMGs can reduce the investment and operating costs of MGs. However, since MGs exchange power through distribution lines, this may have an adverse effect on the utility, such as an increase in peak demand, and cause local overcurrent issues. Therefore, this paper proposes a power sharing scheme that is beneficial to both MGs and the utility. This research assumes that in an MG, the energy storage system (ESS) is the major controllable resource. In the proposed power sharing scheme, an MG that sends power should discharge at least as much power from the ESS as the power it sends to other MGs, in order to actually decrease the total system demand. With these assumptions, methods for determining the power sharing schedule are proposed. Firstly, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based centralized approach is proposed. Although this can provide the optimal power sharing solution, in practice, this method is very difficult to apply, due to the large calculation burden. To overcome the significant calculation burden of the centralized optimization method, a new method for determining the power sharing schedule is proposed. In this approach, the amount of power sharing is assumed to be a multiple of a unit amount, and the final power sharing schedule is determined by iteratively finding the best MG pair that exchange this unit amount. Simulation with a five MG scenario is used to test the proposed power sharing scheme and the scheduling algorithm in terms of a reduction in the operating cost of MGs, the peak demand of utility, and the calculation burden. In addition, the interrelationship between power sharing and the system loss is analyzed when MGs exchange power through the utility network. © 2020 by the authors.},

The purpose of this paper is to study a nonpreemptive scheduling problem on a single-machine to minimize the total tardiness and total energy cost under time-of-use electricity tariffs, which is a mixed-integer multi-objective mathematical programming model. To achieve these objectives, we develop several new holistic genetic algorithms. The proposed model is solved via several methods including weighted sum method and multiobjective genetic algorithms based on dominance rank (GA-1), weighted sum aggregation (GA-2), dominance ranking procedure and crowding distance comparison (GA-3), and heuristic approach (GA-H). This paper illustrates that operations management, which is typically observed as a significant technique that allows manufacturing to operate in challenging data enabled environment in an industrial internet of things ecosystem, can also carefully optimize a production process to improve energy cost in order to manage environmental challenges. Thus, the findings provide information on when to start each job. We provide detailed experimental results evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithms. In a case study, we illustrate how the results of the multiobjective model could be utilized in decision making using the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution method. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an economic dispatch method for an integrated heat and electricity system with respect to network constraints. Network constraints are usually nonlinear and can cause severe difficulties for optimization solvers. Particularly, in a heating network, the mass flow mixing at each node and the pressure and temperature drop along each pipe involve both hydraulic and thermal processes, which can cause high nonlinearity that has not been properly modeled. This paper will firstly model the power and heat network constraints by using a nonlinear model, which is accurate but hard to solve. Then, simplification and convexification will be employed to reform the nonlinear constraints to linear and conic ones. Consequently, the entire economic dispatch problem will be modeled as a mixed integer conic programming problem. Because the proposed model allows for the changes of the mass flow rate and direction, an optimal mass flow profile can be achieved along with the solution of the economic dispatch. Case studies on an integrated district heating and power system with a portfolio of power and heat sources show that the proposed economic dispatch model can handle the complexity of the network constraints and make optimal dispatch plans for multi-energy systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In this paper, targeting at improving the energy efficiency (EE) for Quality-of-Service (QoS)-guaranteed wireless communications, we develop new adaptive modulation and data scheduling algorithms for delay-sensitive bursty data. Assuming a-priori knowledge on data arrivals and latency requirements, the problem is formulated as a mix-integer programming that minimizes the total energy consumption at the transmitter with a non-linear Doherty power amplifier (PA) and non-negligible circuit power. According to the different properties of the PA in different output power regions, we decouple the formulated problem and solve it in two stages. In the first stage, assuming the PA has a linear efficiency, we develop an optimal modulation and data scheduling scheme (MDS) relying on convex relaxation and the resultant optimality conditions. The MDS is able to reveal the specific structure of the optimal policy in a computationally efficient and graphical manner. On top of that, a heuristic MDS scheme (HMDS) is proposed to adjust the MDS when the PA works in the non-linear region in the second stage, where a quadratic function is obtained to approximate the non-linear PA model. The offline HMDS algorithm is further extended to practical online scenarios in a well-structured way, where the modulation and data scheduling policy is produced on-the-fly. Simulation corroborates that the proposed offline algorithm can achieve the exactly same performance as the standard CVX solver, while requiring only 0.69% of its computational time. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We investigate multi-criteria optimization and Pareto front generation. Given an application modeled as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of tasks and a multicore architecture, we produce a set of non-dominated (in the Pareto sense) static schedules of this DAG onto this multicore. The criteria we address are the execution time, reliability, power consumption, and peak temperature. These criteria exhibit complex antagonistic relations, which make the problem challenging. For instance, improving the reliability requires adding some redundancy in the schedule, which penalizes the execution time. To produce Pareto fronts in this 4-dimension space, we transform three of the four criteria into constraints (the reliability, the power consumption, and the peak temperature), and we minimize the fourth one (the execution time of the schedule) under these three constraints. By varying the thresholds used for the three constraints, we are able to produce a Pareto front of non-dominated solutions. We propose two algorithms to compute static schedules. The first is a ready list scheduling heuristic called Execution time, Reliability, POwer consumption and Temperature (ERPOT). ERPOT actively replicates the tasks to increase the reliability, uses Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling to decrease the power consumption, and inserts cooling times to control the peak temperature. The second algorithm uses an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) program to compute an optimal schedule. However, because our multi-criteria scheduling problem is NP-complete, the ILP algorithm is limited to very small problem instances. Comparisons showed that the schedules produced by ERPOT are on average only 10 percent worse than the optimal schedules computed by the ILP program, and that ERPOT outperforms the PowerPerf-PET heuristic from the literature on average by 33 percent. © 1990-2012 IEEE.},

In addition, a common situation in this kind of service is also addressed: the need of a constant re-planning caused by the leaving of patients and the arrival of new ones. This new plan should be such that minimum disturbance is caused to the visiting hours of current patients, the caregivers’ travelling time between visits is minimized, and the workload is balanced among caregivers. A multi-objective optimization approach based on mixed-integer models is developed. Results on the two real case studies show that both institutions can efficiently re-plan their activities without much disturbance on the visits of their patients, and with a patient-caregiver loyalty scheme suiting their needs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the outdoor campaign allocation problem (OCAP), which asks for the distribution of campaign items to billboards considering a number of constraints. In particular, for a metropolitan city with a large number of billboards, the problem becomes challenging. We propose a genetic algorithm-based method to allocate campaign items effectively, and we compare our results with those of nonlinear integer programming and greedy approaches. Real-world data sets are collected with the given constraints of the price class ratios of billboards located in İstanbul and the budgets of the given campaigns. The methods are evaluated in terms of the efficiency of the constructed plans and the construction time of the planning. The results reveal that the genetic algorithm-based approach gives close to optimal results in the shortest scheduling time for the OCAP, and it scales linearly with the increasing data sizes. © 2020 Turkiye Klinikleri.

	abstract = {The Kiel Canal is an artificial waterway of about 100 km that connects the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. It allows ships to save several hundred kilometers of travel distance compared with going around the Jutland Peninsula (Denmark). Since the canal contains several narrow segments where large ships cannot pass each other, it needs to be decided on which ships have to wait in the wider siding segments to ensure a fast and safe passage of all ships. With this paper, several new optimization models are proposed for this traffic managing problem, which include variable ship speeds, capacities of siding segments, and limits for waiting times of ships. All model variants capture the relevant traffic rules and safety requirements with the goal to minimize the total transit time of ships. A matheuristic is proposed for solving the problem quickly. Experiments on real world data confirm the excellent performance of the heuristic and identify the potentials for providing high quality service to ships. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Due to the increasing market share of electric vehicles (EVs), the optimal thermal management (TM) of batteries has recently received significant attention. Optimal battery temperature control is challenging, requiring a detailed model and numerous parameters of the TM system, which includes fans, pumps, compressors, and heat exchangers. This paper proposes a supervised learning strategy for the optimal operation of the TM system in an EV. Specifically, for TM subsystems, individual artificial neural networks (ANNs) are implemented and trained with data obtained under normal EV driving conditions. The ANNs are then interconnected based on the physical configuration of the TM system. The trained ANNs are replicated using piecewise linear equations, which can be explicitly integrated into an optimization problem for optimal TM scheduling. This approach enables the application of a mixed-integer linear programming solver to the problem, ensuring the optimality of the solution. Simulation case studies are performed for the two operating modes of the TM system: i.e., integrated and separate modes. The case study results demonstrate that the ANN-based model successfully reflects the operating characteristics of the TM system, enabling accurate battery temperature estimation. The proposed optimal TM strategy using the ANN-based model is verified as effective in reducing the total energy consumption, while maintaining the battery temperature within an acceptable range. © 2013 IEEE.},

Currently, the scheduling process of such examinations is done by the undergraduate thesis coordinator manually without certain systematic method or approach. In this paper, we develop an optimization model for the examinations scheduling considering several factors, namely the number of lecturers that must attend the examinations, the availability of rooms for examinations, the availability of each lecturer, and the assignment distributions. The model uses integer programming approach. Two performance criteria are used in the model, namely the difference between the number of each lecturer’s assignment with the average number of lecturer assignments and the number of penalties from the assignment of lecturers on certain time slot. The developed model is able to solve the scheduling problem more efficiently than manual scheduling done by thesis coordinator. The optimal solutions from the optimization model show a total difference in the assignment of lecturer with an average of 29.6 and a penalty of 0. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {At universities, the timetable plays a large role in the daily life of students and staff, showing when and where lectures are given. But whenever a schedule is executed in a dynamic environment, disruptions will occur. It is then desirable to find a new timetable similar to the old one, so only a few people will be affected. This leads to a minimum perturbation problem, where the goal is to find a feasible timetable by changing as few assignments as possible. This solution will, however, often lead to timetables of low quality as it can have many undesired features that will cause much inconvenience for effected parties. In this paper we show that minimum perturbation solutions often have low quality and how using additional perturbations results in timetables with significantly higher quality while still keeping the number of perturbations low, so the solutions can be practically implemented. We formulate a bi-objective model and propose a method to solve it by using mixed integer programming. We test the method on standard instances of the Curriculum-based Course Timetabling Problem with four different types of disruptions. The use of bi-objective optimization enables us to generate multiple solutions whereby we provide the decision makers with multiple choices for handling the disruption. This allows the decision makers to determine the best trade-off between the number of perturbations and the quality, ultimately leading to better timetables for students and staff when disruptions occur. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

In such production environments, scheduling problems with time constraints are of high relevance to ensure the timely flow of the work-in-process material and goods. This study introduces the no-wait flowshop scheduling problem with release times (NWFSP-RT) to help advance decision support systems in the food production industry. For this purpose, an original mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation is proposed for minimizing makespan. A BS algorithm, and an improved variant, the local search-based Beam Search (BSLS) algorithms are developed to solve the NWFSP-RT problem. Extensive numerical analysis is conducted to analyze the performance of the algorithms in solving this highly intractable extension of the scheduling problems. We showed that BSLS effectively avoids early convergence and local optimality while dismissing non-promising search directions within a partial enumeration solution approach. The statistical analysis confirmed that the improved BS algorithm performs better in terms of solution quality. Applications of the developed heuristic are worthwhile research topics to pursue in solving other complex optimization problems.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Specifically, multiple source UAVs (SUAVs) send confidential information to multiple legitimate ground users, and in the meantime, multiple jamming UAVs cooperatively transmit interference signals to multiple eavesdroppers in order to improve the legitimate users achievable secrecy rate. By taking into account the limited energy budget of UAV, our goal is to maximize the system secrecy energy efficiency (SEE), namely the achievable secrecy rate per energy consumption unit, by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, transmit power, and user scheduling under the constraints of UAV mobility as well as the maximum transmit power. The resulting optimization problem is shown to be a non-convex and mixed-integer fractional optimization problem, which is challenging to solve. We decompose the original problem into three sub-problems, and then, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed by leveraging the block coordinate descent method and Dinkelbach method in combination with successive convex approximation techniques.

	abstract = {In the transportation industry, crew management is typically decomposed into two phases: crew scheduling and crew rostering. Due to the complexity of scheduling and rostering, bus transportation is not an exception and many relevant studies do not consider both procedures simultaneously. However, such a decomposition can yield inferior schedules/rosters. To address this issue, this paper proposes an integrated scheduling and rostering model for bus drivers and devises a branch-and-price-and-cut (BPC) algorithm to solve the complex problem. The proposed solution framework is empirically applied to real-world instances with various problem sizes whose data is collected from H Bus Company located in southern Taiwan. To validate the effectiveness and evaluate the efficiency of the proposed solution framework, this paper compares the solution obtained from the BPC algorithm with that of a benchmark optimization package. The results show that the proposed BPC algorithm can solve problems with large real-world instances within a reasonable computational time. Moreover, in the numerical experiments, this paper finds that the scheduling and rostering results of the bus drivers are more sensitive to the rostering constraints. Also, the proposed integrated framework can yield a better solution than the solution from a conventional two-phase approach, which demonstrates the advantage of the integration in this paper. The proposed method provided can be employed to deal with the challenges in driver planning for bus companies. © 2020 Dung-Ying Lin et al.},

	abstract = {This paper presents two stochastic optimization approaches for simultaneous project scheduling and personnel planning, extending a deterministic model previously developed by Heimerl and Kolisch. For the problem of assigning work packages to multi-skilled human resources with heterogeneous skills, the uncertainty on work package processing times is addressed. In the case where the required capacity exceeds the available capacity of internal resources, external human resources are used. The objective is to minimize the expected external costs. The first solution approach is a “matheuristic” based on a decomposition of the problem into a project scheduling subproblem and a staffing subproblem. An iterated local search procedure determines the project schedules, while the staffing subproblem is solved by means of the Frank–Wolfe algorithm for convex optimization. The second solution approach is sample average approximation where, based on sampled scenarios, the deterministic equivalent problem is solved through mixed-integer programming. Experimental results for synthetically generated test instances inspired by a real-world situation are provided, and some managerial insights are derived. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This paper considers a time window periodic maintenance strategy with different duration windows and job scheduling activities in a single machine environment. The aim is to minimize the number of tardy jobs through the integration of production scheduling and periodic maintenance intervals. A mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP) is proposed to optimize small-sized test instances. Furthermore, an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is developed to solve larger sized test instances. Subsequently, to measure the efficiency of the solutions obtained by ACO, Moore's algorithm is also developed to benchmark with ACO. To test the efficiency and the effectiveness of the ACO algorithm, a set of data for small and large sized problems was generated in which several parameters were adopted and then ten replicates were solved for each combination. The small sized instances were solved by the MILP. Then, the results obtained showed that the proposed ACO was able to obtain the exact solutions within reasonable CPU times, thus, it outperformed the CPLEX solver with respect to CPU. The large sized instances were solved by the Moore's algorithm and compared to ACO. Then, the results obtained showed that the ACO outperforms Moore's algorithm for all the instances tested. It can be concluded that the developed ACOis very efficient and effective in solving the problem considered in this paper. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a variable block insertion heuristic (VBIH) algorithm to solve the permutation flow shop scheduling problem (PFSP). The VBIH algorithm removes a block of jobs from the current solution. It applies an insertion local search to the partial solution. Then, it inserts the block into all possible positions in the partial solution sequentially. It chooses the best one amongst those solutions from block insertion moves. Finally, again an insertion local search is applied to the complete solution. If the new solution obtained is better than the current solution, it replaces the current solution with the new one. As long as it improves, it retains the same block size. Otherwise, the block size is incremented by one and a simulated annealing-based acceptance criterion is employed to accept the new solution in order to escape from local minima. This process is repeated until the block size reaches its maximum size. To verify the computational results, mixed integer programming (MIP) and constraint programming (CP) models are developed and solved using very recent small VRF benchmark suite. Optimal solutions are found for 108 out of 240 instances. Extensive computational results on the VRF large benchmark suite show that the proposed algorithm outperforms two variants of the iterated greedy algorithm. 236 out of 240 instances of large VRF benchmark suite are further improved for the first time in this paper. Ultimately, we run Taillard's benchmark suite and compare the algorithms. In addition to the above, three instances of Taillard's benchmark suite are also further improved for the first time in this paper since 1993. © 2019 by the authors.},

The aim is to find an efficient, regular and robust timetable that utilizes the infrastructure capacity as good as possible. Based on the Periodic Event Scheduling Problem, we formulate the MOPRT problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). The ε-constraint method is applied to deal with the multi-objective property, and algorithms are designed to efficiently create the Pareto frontier. By solving the problem for different values of ε, the four-dimensional Pareto frontier is explored to uncover the trade-offs among the four objectives. The optimal solution is obtained from the Pareto-optimal set by using standardized Euclidean distance, while capacity utilization is used as an additional indicator to chose between close solutions. Computational experiments are performed on a theoretical instance and a real instance in one direction of a Dutch railway corridor, demonstrating the efficiency of the model and approach. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Mobile-edge computing (MEC) is an emerging technology for enhancing the computational capabilities of the mobile devices and reducing their energy consumption via offloading complex computation tasks to the nearby servers. Multiuser MEC at servers is widely realized via parallel computing based on virtualization. Due to finite shared I/O resources, interference between virtual machines (VMs), called I/O interference, degrades the computation performance. In this paper, we study the problem of joint radio-And-computation resource allocation (RCRA) in multiuser MEC systems in the presence of I/O interference. Specifically, offloading scheduling algorithms is designed targeting two system performance metrics: Sum offloading rate maximization and sum mobile energy consumption minimization. Their designs are formulated as non-convex mixed-integer programming problems, which account for latency due to offloading, result downloading, and parallel computing. A set of low-complexity algorithms are designed based on a decomposition approach and leveraging classic techniques from combinatorial optimization. The resultant algorithms jointly schedule offloading users, control their offloading sizes, and divide time for communication (offloading and downloading) and computation. They are either optimal or can achieve close-To-optimality as shown by simulation. The comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that considering of I/O interference can endow on an offloading controller robustness against the performance-degradation factor. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

The planning horizon is fixed and separated into a set of time periods of equal length. There are several types of resources and their amount varies from one period to another. There is a set of jobs. For each job, a fixed volume of work has to be completed without any preemption while using different resources. If necessary, extra resources can be used at additional costs during each time period. The optimization goal is to minimize the total overload costs required for the execution of all jobs by the given deadline. The decision variables specify the starting time of each job, the duration of the job and the resource amount assigned to the job during each period (it may vary over periods). We propose a new generalized mathematical formulation for this optimization problem. The formulation is compared with existing approaches from the literature.

First, this study introduces a DER management system in the residential building for participation to the day-ahead DR market. The distributed photovoltaic generation system (PV) and energy-storage system (ESS) are applied to reduce the electricity demand in the building and sell surplus energy on the grid. Among loads in the building, lighting (LTG) and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads are included in the DR program. In addition, it is assumed that a power management system of an electric vehicle (EV) charging station is integrated the DER management system. In order to describe stochastic behavior of EV owners, the uncertainty of EV is formulated based on their arrival and departure scenarios. For measuring the economic efficiency of the proposed model, we compare it with the DER self-consuming operation model without DR participation. The problem is solved using mixed integer linear programming to minimize the operating cost. The results in summer and winter are analyzed to evaluate the proposed algorithm’s validity. From these results, the proposed model can be confirmed as reducing operation cost compared to the reference model through optimal day-ahead DR capacity bidding and implementation. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The cyclic train timetabling problem aims to synchronize limited operational resources toward a master periodic schedule of transport services. By introducing an extended time-space network construct, this paper proposes a new type of integer programming model reformulation for the cyclic train timetabling problem on a double-track railway corridor at the macroscopic level. This reformulation method also holds the promises to be applied in a broader set of routing and scheduling problems with periodic activity requirements. We also hope that this space-time network extension technique, as a special version of variable splitting methods in the dual decomposition literature, could potentially bridge the modeling gaps between cyclic and non-cyclic timetables. Specifically, the existing mathematical programming model for the periodic event scheduling problem (PESP) is transformed into a multi-commodity network flow model with two coupled schedule networks and side track capacity constraints. In addition, two dual decomposition methods including Lagrangian relaxation and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), are adopted to dualize the side track capacity constraints. For each train-specific sub-problem in an iterative primal and dual optimization framework, we develop an enhanced version of forward dynamic programming to find the time-dependent least cost master schedule across the time-space network over multiple periods. ADMM-motivated heuristic methods with adjusted penalty parameters are also developed to obtain good upper bound solutions. Based on real-world instances from the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway corridor, we compare the numerical performance between the proposed reformulation and the PESP model that involves the standard optimization solver. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The need for innovative pathways for future zero-emission and sustainable power development has recently accelerated the uptake of variable renewable energy resources (VREs). However, integration of VREs such as photovoltaic and wind generators requires the right approaches to design and operational planning towards coping with the fluctuating outputs. This paper investigates the technical and economic prospects of scheduling flexible demand resources (FDRs) in optimal configuration planning of VRE-based microgrids. The proposed demand-side management (DSM) strategy considers short-term power generation forecast to efficiently schedule the FDRs ahead of time in order to minimize the gap between generation and load demand. The objective is to determine the optimal size of the battery energy storage, photovoltaic and wind systems at minimum total investment costs. Two simulation scenarios, without and with the consideration of DSM, were investigated. The random forest algorithm implemented on scikit-learn python environment is utilized for short-term power prediction, and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) on MATLABR○ is used for optimum configuration optimization. From the simulation results obtained here, the application of FDR scheduling resulted in a significant cost saving of investment costs. Moreover, the proposed approach demonstrated the effectiveness of the FDR in minimizing the mismatch between the generation and load demand. © 2019 by the authors.

In this model, the upper-level player of the Main Problem (MP) minimizes the total cost from DSO's perspective, while in the lower-level of the MP, networked MGs compete with retailers in the retail electricity market as an interior Sub Problem (SP). In the upper-level of the SP the profit of each MG is maximized, where in the lower-level of the SP the social welfare of the retail market clearing process is maximized. Since the resulting bi-level problem is nonlinear and non-convex, it is transformed into a single-level Mixed-Integer Second-Order Cone Programming (MISOCP) problem using Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions and linearization techniques. The effectiveness of the proposed model is investigated on a real-test system in both grid-connected and islanded modes under different scenarios. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In today's competitive environment, one of the most critical objectives for Home Health Care (HHC) companies is to meet the demand of patients in a timely fashion. According to the feedback from HHC companies, caregivers have to deal with some uncertainties when carrying out a given schedule to visit their patients. However, a majority of the previous work only considers the deterministic models which ignore the uncertainties, and solutions obtained by these deterministic models are usually less robust in case of any possible changes in practical situations. Inspired by this point, in this work, we formulate a model for an HHC Routing and Scheduling Problem with taking into account uncertain travel and service times, from the perspective of Robust Optimization (RO). Specifically, the non-deterministic variables are defined based on the theory of budget uncertainty, and then the arrival time of each caregiver is rewritten as a complicated recursive function. After that, Gurobi Solver, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, and Variable Neighborhood Search are adapted to solve the model respectively. Finally, a series of experiments have been performed to validate the proposed models and algorithms. Experimental results from Monte Carlo simulation highlight the strength of considering uncertainties when modeling the problem. Additional, the influences of other characters in instances, like the width of time-window, distributed location have also been empirically analyzed. Finally, the comparison performed between the solutions obtained by the stochastic model and the RO model also demonstrates the advantage of the RO model. This work provides a valuable framework for HHC companies to make a robust schedule when arranging the caregivers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

We can fully use these two properties by carefully optimizing the UAVs' trajectories and cooperating with some facilities. A UAV working as a mobile relay now attracts many interests due to its low cost and reliable performance. In this paper, we study a relaying system, where a UAV works as an aerial mobile relay to help some ground base stations send information to ground users periodically by using time division multiple access (TDMA). We aim to maximize the minimum average user rate through solving a non-convex and information causality constraints involved problem by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, nodes scheduling, and power allocation to ensure the fairness among all users. Finally, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm to solve a derived mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem to achieve this target by using block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods and prove the convergence of our algorithm. Simulations show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, some useful trade-offs and insights about the structure of our optimized trajectory, and the influence of two widely used trajectory initialization methods. © 2013 IEEE.},

In a MES, electricity, heating, cooling, water, and other resources interact at various levels, in order to get optimized operation. The aim of this study is to identify the optimal combination of components, their optimal sizes, and operating schedule allowing minimizing the annual cost for meeting the energy demand of Pantelleria, a Mediterranean island. Starting from the existing energy system (comprising diesel generators, desalination plant, freshwater storage, heat pumps, and domestic hot water storages) the installation of solar resources (photovoltaic and solar thermal) and electrical storage were considered. In this way, the optimal scheduling of storage units injections, water desalination operation, and domestic hot water production was deduced. An energy hub model was implemented using MATLAB to represent the problem. All equations in the model are linear functions, and variables are real or integer. Thus, a mixed integer linear programming algorithm was used for the solution of the optimization problem. Results prove that the method allows a strong reduction of operating costs of diesel generators also in the existing configuration. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Efficient rolling stock schedules have always been the focus of railway companies. At the Chinese High-Speed Railway, rolling stock scheduling is usually done manually by dispatchers. Such an approach often makes it difficult to quickly obtain an optimal rolling stock schedule that can be used to operate the proposed timetable and which is also feasible with respect to the rolling stock maintenance requirements. In this paper, we consider the problem of rolling stock scheduling with maintenance requirements and propose a heuristic approach that decomposes the problem into two main stages. In the first stage, the maintenance restrictions are ignored and a conventional Mixed Integer Programming model is used to generate multiple candidate rolling stock schedules. In the second stage, we check to see whether any of the candidate rolling stock schedules are feasible when maintenance restrictions for the individual rolling stock units are also considered. Checking a candidate rolling stock schedule can be performed using an assignment problem. To provide some structure to the search, candidate rolling stock schedules generated in the first stage are sorted in descending order according to their objective values. The two stages can be iteratively performed to avoid generating all schedules in the first stage before proceeding to the second stage. We analyze the performance of the proposed approach on real-life instances provided by the Chinese High-Speed Railway. These instances focus on the railway network within the Zhengzhou Group, which is one of the busiest transportation networks in China. Comparisons with the manual approach that is currently used in practice show that the proposed approach yields far superior schedules. The optimized schedules improve rolling stock efficiency and lead to a reduction in operating cost of approximately 10.5%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {We consider a scheduling and sequencing optimization problem with application to an agricultural seeding operation. The problem is motivated by potential deployment of a recently proposed mobile seed refilling system in large-scale field operations. In this setting, mobile refiller vehicles are used to minimize any interruptions to seeding that result from the need to refill the seed tanks on the planters. A feature of this refilling system is that the two types of vehicles can move together during the seed transfer operation. The optimization task seeks to determine locations where seed transfer should be initiated, as well as an ordering of visits of refiller vehicles to such locations, such that the total downtime is minimized. In this paper, we consider such an optimization task for the case of multiple planters and a single refiller that, in turn, can refill itself at a single, fixed, off-field location. We rely on a stochastic solution strategy for solving this problem by applying the genetic algorithm to a binary integer programming model that represents the decision of whether to initiate refilling or not at a discrete set of possible locations along each planter path. The results are compared with a conventional static refilling scheme (with no mobile refiller), as well as a greedy (but generally suboptimal) algorithm that produces a unique solution to the selection and ordering of rendezvous locations. The computational analysis provides deep and useful insights to this optimization problem. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Distributed Integrated Modular Avionics (DIMA) develops from Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) and realizes distributed integration of multiple sub-function areas. Time-triggered network provides effective support for time synchronization and information coordination in DIMA systems. However, inconsistency between processing resources and communication network destroys the time determinism benefiting from partitions and time-triggered mechanism. To ensure such time determinism and achieve guaranteed real-time performance, system design should collectively provide a global communication scheme for messages in network domain and a corresponding execution scheme for partitions in processing domain. This paper firstly establishes a general DIMA model which coordinates partitioned processing and time-triggered communication, and then proposes a hybrid scheduling algorithm using Mixed Integer Programming to produce feasible system schemes. Furthermore, incrementally integrating new functions causes upgrades or reconfigurations of DIMA systems and will generate integration cost. To control such cost, this paper further develops an optimization algorithm based on Maximum Satisfiability Problem and guarantees that the scheduling design for upgraded DIMA systems inherit their original schemes as much as possible. Finally, two typical cases, including a simple fully connected DIMA system case and an industrial DIMA system case, are constructed to illustrate our DIMA model and validate the effectiveness of our hybrid scheduling algorithms. © 2019 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics},

In particular, roads can be damaged or blocked by debris, thereby obstructing access to certain affected areas. Thus, restoration of the damaged roads is necessary to evacuate victims and distribute emergency commodities to relief centers or affected areas. The Crew Scheduling and Routing Problem (CSRP) addresses decisions in post-disaster situations with the aim of minimizing the time that affected areas remain inaccessible. The integration of crew scheduling and routing decisions makes this problem too complicated to be effectively solved for practical instances using mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations recently proposed in the literature. Therefore, we propose a branch-and-Benders-cut (BBC) algorithm that decomposes the integrated problem into a master problem (MP) with scheduling decisions and subproblems with routing decisions. Computational tests based on instances from the literature show that the proposed exact method improves the results of MIP formulations and other exact and metaheuristic methods proposed in literature. The BBC algorithm provides feasible solutions and optimality gaps for instances that thus far have not been possible to solve by exact methods in the literature. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The phenomenon of crossing the forbidden zone is unavoidable and wasteful when scheduling the hydro units. In this paper, the effect of crossing the forbidden zone is taken into account using the strategic offering model to help the price-maker hydro producers (PMHPs) devise more economic offering strategies in this paper. This effect is economically quantified and formulated in the form of the mixed integer linear program (MILP) with the use of the big M method and the piecewise linear technique. Therefore, the effect of crossing the forbidden zone therefore can easily be incorporated into the strategic offering model. Based on the residual demand curve (RDC) scenarios, the strategic offering model, which consists of offering and self-scheduling models, is established according to the real-world data from the Three Gorges Project (TGP). The whole optimization model is then converted into the form of MILP formulations by properly discretizing the net head. A test case based on the TGP is presented, in which the strategic offering model is set as a comparable test while ignoring the effect of crossing the forbidden zone. The results provide insight on the offering strategy and physical system operations during a single day. The outcomes indicate that the model that incorporates the effect of crossing the forbidden zone will effectively prevent the crossing phenomenon from happening and that the proposed strategic offering model is more useful for assisting a PMHP in developing profitable offering strategy. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A well designed train timetable should fully utilize the limited infrastructure and rolling stock resources to maximize operators’ profits and passenger travel demand satisfaction. Thus, an internally coherent scheduling process should consider the three main aspects: (1) dynamic choice behaviors of passengers so as to evaluate and calculate the impact of variable passenger demand to (2) underlying train service patterns and detailed timetables, which in turn are constrained by (3) infrastructure and rolling stock capacity. This paper aims to develop an integrated demand/service/resource optimization model for managing the above-mentioned three key decision elements with a special focus on passengers’ responses to time-dependent service interval times or frequencies. The model particularly takes into account service-sensitive passenger demand as internal variables so that one can accurately map passengers to train services through a representation of passenger carrying states throughout a team of trains. The added state dimension leads to a linear integer multi-commodity flow formulation in which three closely interrelated decision elements, namely passengers’ response to service interval times, train stopping pattern planning and timetabling for conflict detecting and resolving are jointly considered internally. By using a Lagrangian relaxation solution framework to recognize the dual costs of both passenger travel demand and limited resources of track and rolling stock, we transfer and decompose the formulation into a novel team-based train service search sub-problem for maximizing the profit of operators. The sub-problem is solvable efficiently by a forward dynamic programming algorithm across multiple trains of a team. Numerical experiments are conducted to examine the efficiency and effectiveness of the dual and primal solution search algorithms. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study proposes a bi-level stochastic framework to address optimal scheduling of energy hub (EH) in a poolbased short-term market considering electrical-thermal-water demands. EH acts as an independent price-maker producer in a day-ahead electricity market aiming to maximise its profit. The market settlement mechanism is constructed as the pay-atmarket- clearing price (MCP), where each producer/consumer is paid at the MCP. The problem model is formulated as a bi-level optimisation approach in a stochastic environment, in which the upper level defines the profit maximisation of the proposed strategic producer, whereas the lower-level expresses the dispatch cost of the considered power grid. This results in a problem formulation with mathematical equilibrium constraints which is transformed into a new mixed-integer linear programme based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. A stochastic framework based on unscented transform is developed to model the high uncertainties of EH water demand, EH thermal demand, EH electric demand, generators and loads submitted price to the market. The simulation results on the IEEE test system advocate the effectiveness and appropriate performance of the proposed strategic EH producer in the electricity market and its effect on the locational marginal prices of buses in a transmission-constrained market. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019.},

A large number of passengers might be stranded on platforms due to service gaps and the limited free capacity of trains. In this paper, by introducing binary variables as selection indicators for ATO profiles which were preset in on-board ATO systems by metro signal suppliers, we develop a mixed integer programming (MIP) model for a metro train timetable rescheduling problem in order to jointly optimize the total train delay, the number of stranded passengers, and the energy consumption of trains. We formulate the total energy consumption as the difference between the tractive energy consumption and the regenerated energy by considering the mass of in-vehicle passengers. Then, we adopt commercial optimization software CPLEX to solve the proposed model, which can obtain tradeoff solutions in a short time. Finally, three numerical experiments based on real-world operational data are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the aim of supporting the process of scheduling a hybrid cyclic timetable and adapting traffic needs, this paper is concerned with inserting additional train paths problem for tactical and short-term planning applications with multiple objectives. Focusing on an existing cyclic timetable on a high-speed passenger rail line, the problem is to minimize both the total adjustments for initial trains and the number of required train-sets. The timetable scheduling, train-set planning and rescheduling are three complex optimization problems respectively and usually solved in a sequential manner. In this paper, these phases are integrated in a mixed integer programming model, and the multi-objective adding train paths (ATP) model is proposed, which decides simultaneously initial trains' modifications, additional trains' schedules and train-set circulation. The tolerance of disruption for initial trains including allowed adjustment and periodic structure is taken into account in light of the practical concerns. The difficulty of this integrated problem is that train-sets circulation is usually determined after all of the train lines and timetable have been fixed. However, in the adding train paths problem, the additional trains do not exist in the initial timetable. In order to solve the problem in a reasonable time, a relaxation approach to the adding paths problem is presented. We start from fixed train-set route, and then apply flexible train-set route that provides possible alternative turning activities to decrease the number of required train-sets. A case study based on Shanghai-Hangzhou high-speed rail line in China illustrates the methodology and compares the performance of various settings of perturbation tolerance, time window and train-set applications. © 2013 IEEE.},

This practice is gaining popularity in the chemical industry and relies on the inventory-routing-problem, which integrates inventory management, vehicle routing, and delivery scheduling decisions. This one is a difficult combinatorial optimization problem both theoretically and practically. However, because of the large expenses involved in distribution and inventorying of chemical products, it is attractive to make use of optimization tools for exploiting as many degrees of freedom as possible with the goal of minimizing both distribution and inventorying costs. Consequently, we propose a nested column generation algorithm for solving an inventorying and distribution problem that models the delivery of several chemicals fluids. The approach is building on a column generation & incomplete branch-and-price algorithm in which for each delivery route, the delivery patterns of fluids are also determined by column generation. We detail the implementation and provide computational results for realistic test instances. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper outlines a method that greatly reduces, and under some conditions eliminates, the mixed-integer aspect of the problem using complementary convex quadratic optimizations. The generalized method applies to grid-connected or islanded district energy systems comprised of any variety of electric or combined heat and power generators, electric chillers, heaters, and all varieties of energy storage systems. It incorporates constraints for generator operating bounds, ramping limitations, and energy storage inefficiencies. An open-source platform, EAGERS, implements and investigates this optimization method.

Capacity limitation for inside resource, just-in-time delivery policy and uncertain processing time are the key assumptions of the proposed model. The objective is to minimize the total-weighted time required to complete all jobs and the total cost of outsourcing.

	abstract = {Efficient scheduling benefits productivity promotion, cost savings, and customer satisfaction. In recent years, with a growing concern about the energy price and environmental impact, energy-oriented scheduling is going to be a key issue for sustainable manufacturing. In this paper, we investigate an energy-oriented scheduling problem deriving from the hybrid flow shop with limited buffers. First, we formulate the scheduling problem with a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, which considers two objectives including minimizing the total weighted tardiness (TWT) and non-processing energy (NPE). To solve the NP-hard problem in the strong sense, we develop an efficient multi-objective optimization algorithm under the framework of the multi-objective objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). We devise a job-permutation vector to represent the scheduling solution and cover its search space. Since NPE is a non-regular function, we develop a two-pass decoding procedure composed of a discrete-event system (DES) simulation procedure and a greedily post-shift procedure. Besides, we apply an external archive population (EAP) to guide the algorithm to converge on a Pareto frontier and a local search procedure to enhance the diversity of the population. Finally, we conduct extensive computational experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed energy-oriented multi-objective optimization (EOMO) algorithm. The results presented in this paper may be useful for future research on energy-oriented scheduling problems in realistic production systems. © 2013 IEEE.},

Regularly, they set up pro-forma schedules, yet it is difficult to stay on time. We consider the problem of managing the delays. Therefore, we need to determine an optimal recovery policy and buffer time allocation to the ship route in order to minimize the total costs associated with delays and recovery actions, such as increasing sailing speed. We introduce a general framework consisting of a mixed integer programming formulation to solve discrete stochastic decision problems with short and long term decisions and apply this framework to the above described problem. Furthermore, we propose and test four heuristics for this problem. We compared the results of our method with an existing liner shipping route schedule and found a cost decrease of 28.9% after optimizing the buffer time distribution compared to the cost of sailing the current route schedule at constant speed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Energy-aware scheduling in manufacturing operations with time-of-use electricity tariffs is a challenging problem. Sustainable manufacturing is gaining significant momentum: companies are not only improving their product quality, but also optimizing the production processes to improve energy consumption (i.e., minimizing energy cost) in order to manage environmental challenges which contribute to global climate change. The purpose of this paper is to study a preemptive scheduling problem on a single-machine to minimize the total completion time and total energy cost under time-of-use electricity tariffs, which is a mixed-integer multiobjective mathematical programming model. To solve these objectives, we develop several new holistic ant colony optimization algorithms. The proposed model is solved via several methods including weighted sum method (WSM) using CPLEX, and multiobjective ant colony optimization based on a dominance ranking (ACO-DR) or based on a dominance ranking procedure and crowding distance comparison (ACO-DRC) or based on a heuristic approach to obtain an approximate Pareto-front and also provide information on when to start and resume each job for any solution on the Pareto-front. We provide detailed experimental results evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithms. In a case study, we demonstrate how the results of the multiobjective model could be utilized in decision making using the multiobjective optimization on the basis of ratio analysis (MOORA) method. This proposed model and heuristics allows decision makers to operate in challenging-data enabled environments in industrial internet of things ecosystem, and assists in optimizing production planning to improve energy cost. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In a typical wirelessly powered sensor network (WPSN), wireless chargers provide energy to sensor nodes by using wireless energy transfer (WET). The chargers can greatly improve the lifetime of a WPSN using energy beamforming by a proper charging scheduling of energy beams. However, the supplied energy still may not meet the demand of the energy of the sensor nodes. This issue can be alleviated by deploying redundant sensor nodes, which not only increase the total harvested energy but also decrease the energy consumption per node provided that an efficient scheduling of the sleep/awake of the nodes is performed. Such a problem of joint optimal sensor deployment, WET scheduling, and node activation is posed and investigated in this paper. The problem is an integer optimization that is challenging due to the binary decision variables and non-linear constraints. Based on the analysis of the necessary condition such that the WPSN be immortal, we decouple the original problem into a node deployment problem and a charging and activation scheduling problem. Then, we propose an algorithm and prove that it achieves the optimal solution under a mild condition. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reduces the needed nodes to deploy by approximately 16%, compared with a random-based approach. The simulation also shows that if the battery buffers are large enough, the optimality condition will be easy to meet. © 2018 IEEE.},

At the operational level, the scheduling posed on each individual facility does not lead to efficient use of resources and consequently an optimal production management over the whole production system cannot be achieved. In this context, a multisite production scheduling framework is fundamental to respond appropriately to the market requirements. In this work, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for the simultaneous batching and scheduling of multisite multiproduct batch plants with nonidentical parallel units is proposed. Given a set of manufacturing sites with unit capacities and structure known and multiple orders with associated release and due dates, the proposed approach determines the plant where each customer order must be processed, the number and sizes of batches to satisfy each order, the assignment of these batches to units, as well as the sequencing and timing of batches on each unit of the plant that processes them, in order to minimize the global makespan related to the whole production system. The application and performance of the proposed model are highlighted through numerical examples. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {This research addresses the sustainability and safety related challenges associated with the complex, practical, and real-time maritime transportation problem, and proposes a multiobjective mathematical model integrating different shipping operations. A mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is formulated considering different maritime operations, such as routing and scheduling of ships, time window concept considering port's high tidal scenario, discrete planning horizon, loading/unloading operation, carbon emission from the vessel, and ship's draft restriction for maintaining the vessel's safety at the port. The relationship between fuel consumption and vessel speed optimization is included in the model for the estimation of the total fuel consumed and carbon emission from each vessel. Time window concept considered in the problem aims to improve the service level of the port by imposing different penalty charges associated with the early arrival of the vessel before the starting of the time window and vessel failing to finish its operation within the allotted time window. Another practical aspect of the maritime transportation such as high tide scenario is included in the model to depict the vessel arrival and departure time at a port. Two novel algorithms-Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and Multiobjective particle swarm optimization have been applied to solve the multiobjective mathematical model. The illustrative examples inspired from the real-life problems of an international shipping company are considered for application.

	abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are now attracting increasing interest from both industries and countries as an environmentally friendly and energy efficient mode of travel. Therefore, the EV charging and/or discharging issue has become an important challenge and research topic in power systems in recent years. An advanced and economic EV charging process, however, should employ smart scheduling, which depends on effective and robust algorithms. To that end, a comprehensive intelligent scatter search (ISS) algorithm within the frame of a basic scatter search has been designed with both unidirectional and bidirectional charging considered. The ISS structure also supports both a flexible and constant charging power rate by respectively employing filter-SQP (sequential quadratic programming) and mixed-integer SQP as local solvers with module control. The detailed design of ISS is presented and the objectives of smoothing the daily load profile and minimizing the charging cost have been tested. Compared with methods based on GS (global search), GA (genetic algorithm), and PSO (particle swarm optimization), the outcome-verified ISS can produce attractive results with a significantly short computational time. Moreover, to handle a large scale EV charging scenario, a hybrid method comprised of a GA and ISS approach has been further developed. Simulation results also verified its prominent performance, plus superbly low computational time. © 2019 by the authors.},

This paper investigates the vehicle scheduling problem on a variable timetable with the constraint that each vehicle can perform limited trips. Since the connection-based model is difficult to solve by optimization software for a medium-scale or large-scale instance, a designed path-based model is developed. A Benders-and-Price algorithm by combining the Benders decomposition and column generation is proposed to solve the LP-relaxation of the path-based model, and a bespoke Branch-and-Price is used to obtain the integer solution. Numerical experiments indicate that a variable timetable approach can reduce the required fleet size with a tolerable timetable deviation in comparison with a fixed timetable approach. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is greatly superior to GUROBI in terms of computational efficiency and guarantees the quality of the solution. © 2019 Zekang Lan et al.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an algorithm to minimize weighted service latency for different classes of tenants (or service classes) in a data center network where erasure-coded files are stored on distributed disks/racks and access requests are scattered across the network. Due to the limited bandwidth available at both top-of-the-rack and aggregation switches, and differentiated service requirements of the tenants, network bandwidth must be apportioned among different intra- and inter-rack data flows for different service classes in line with their traffic statistics. We formulate this problem as weighted queuing and employ a class of probabilistic request scheduling policies to derive a closed-form upper-bound of service latency for erasure-coded storage with arbitrary file access patterns and service time distributions. The result enables us to propose a joint weighted latency (over different service classes) optimization over three entangled control knobs: the bandwidth allocation at top-of-the-rack and aggregation switches for different service classes, dynamic scheduling of file requests, and the placement of encoded file chunks (i.e., data locality). The joint optimization is shown to be a mixed-integer problem. We develop an iterative algorithm which decouples and solves the joint optimization as 3 sub-problems, which are either convex or solvable via bipartite matching in polynomial time. The proposed algorithm is prototyped in an open-source, distributed file system, Tahoe, and evaluated on a cloud testbed with 16 separate physical hosts in an OpenStack cluster using Cisco switches. Experiments validate our theoretical latency analysis and show significant latency reduction for diverse file access patterns. The results provide valuable insights on designing low-latency data center networks with erasure coded storage. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The quick growth of energy consumption in urban rail transit has drawn much attention due to the pressure of both operational cost and environmental responsibilities. In this paper, the timetable is optimized with respect to the system cost of urban rail transit, which pays more attention to energy consumption. Firstly, we propose a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) model including the non-linear objective and constraints. The objective and constraints are linearized for an easier process of solution. Then, a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is employed, which is solved using the commercial solver Gurobi. Furthermore, from the viewpoint of system cost, we present an alternative objective to optimize the total operational cost. Real Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) data from the Changping Line of Beijing urban rail transit is applied to validate the model in the case study. The results show that the designed timetable could achieve about a 35% energy reduction compared with the maximum energy consumption and a 6.6% cost saving compared with the maximum system cost. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Personnel scheduling is a difficult problem with many specific requirements that differ between industries or companies. This paper proposes an Integer Programming (IP) formulation for the staff scheduling problem encountered in practice at an Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system. Two types of heuristics (a diving heuristic and a VNDS heuristic) are implemented and extensively tested on a set of problem instances with different dimensions. Results show that the VNDS heuristic clearly outperforms both the diving heuristic and a state-of-the-art commercial IP solver. It is able to find good quality solutions for realistic problem instances in relatively short computation times. The characteristics that determine the relative difficulty of a problem instance are also investigated. Furthermore, the model is applied to a case study at the Portuguese National Institute for Medical Emergencies. For this purpose, the VNDS heuristic has been implemented in an expert system with an easy-to-use graphical user interface. A number of different schedules proposed by the system are compared with the schedule implemented in practice. This analysis shows that the VNDS heuristic is a significant improvement over the current manual scheduling procedure. Moreover, two what-if scenarios are described to show how the expert system can be used to assist managers in making decisions on contracting additional staff or providing training to workers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The objective is to match patients with healthcare aides and schedule multiple home visits over a given time horizon, to maximize the number of patients served while taking into account patient requirements, travel time, and scheduling constraints. Unlike classical Benders methods, LBBD allows us to exploit a natural decomposition of the problem into a master problem, solved by mixed integer programming, and a subproblem that decouples into small scheduling problems, solved by constraint programming. We report computational results based on data obtained from a major home hospice care provider.We find that LBBD is far superior to mixed integer programming on all but a few instances with narrow time windows. It solves problems of realistic size to optimality if the aim is to conduct staff planning on a rolling basis, without temporal dependencies between visits. We also find that a version of LBBD known as branch and check usually outperforms standard LBBD on the instances tested. © 2019 INFORMS.},

	abstract = {In this study, a mixed integer programming model is proposed to address timetable rescheduling problem under primary delays. The model considers timetable rescheduling strategies such as retiming, reordering, and adjusting stop pattern. A genetic algorithm-based particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed where position vector and genetic evolution operators are reconstructed based on departure and arrival time of each train at stations. Finally, a numerical experiment of Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway corridor is implemented to test the proposed model and algorithm. The results show that the objective value of proposed method is decreased by 15.6%, 48.8%, and 25.7% compared with the first-come-first-service strategy, the first-schedule-first-service strategy, and the particle swarm optimization, respectively. The gap between the best solution obtained by the proposed method and the optimum solution computed by CPLEX solver is around 19.6%. All delay cases are addressed within acceptable time (within 1.5 min). Moreover, the case study gives insight into the correlation between delay propagation and headway. The primary delays occur in high-density period (scheduled headway closes to the minimum headway), which results in a great delay propagation. © 2019 Mingming Wang et al.},

However, even in such platforms the power wall phenomena still imposes limits to performance. Hard real-time systems are part of life critical environments and reducing the energy consumption on such systems is an onerous and complex process. We tackle the problem from the perspective of different representative integer programming mathematical formulations and their interplay on the search for optimal solutions for Rate Monotonic (RM) and Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling algorithms. The proposed models are based on a well-established formulation in the operational research literature, namely, the Multilevel Generalized Assignment Problem (MGAP). This paper, therefore, assesses the problem of finding optimal allocations and frequency assignments of hard real-time tasks among heterogeneous processors targeting low power consumption, but taking into account timing constraints. Computational experiments show that finding optimal solutions reduces the estimated energy consumption of the evaluated cases when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In modern integrated modular avionic systems, applications share hardware resources on a common avionic platform. Such an architecture necessitates strict requirements on the spatial and temporal partitioning of the system to prevent fault propagation between different aircraft functions. One way to establish a temporal partitioning is through pre-runtime scheduling of the system, which involves creating a schedule for both tasks and a communication network. While avionic systems are growing more and more complex, so is the challenge of scheduling them. The scheduling of the system has an important role in the development of new avionic systems, since functionality is typically added to the system over a period of several years and a scheduling tool is used both to detect if the platform can host the new functionality and, if this is possible, to create a new schedule. For this reason an exact solution strategy for avionics scheduling is preferred over a heuristic one. In this paper we present a mathematical model for an industrially relevant avionic system and present a constraint generation procedure for the scheduling of such systems. We apply our optimisation approach to instances provided by our industrial partner. These instances are of relevance for the development of future avionic systems and contain up to 20,000 tasks to be scheduled. The computational results show that our optimisation approach can be used to create schedules for such instances within a reasonable time. © 2018, The Author(s).},

The considered problem is an integration of three interconnected sub-problems from different planning levels: the strategic fleet sizing and mix problem, the tactical voyage planning problem, and the operational stochastic backhaul cargo canvassing problem. To obtain the optimal solution of the problem, this paper provides a two-step algorithmic scheme. In the first step, the stochastic backhaul cargo canvassing problem is solved by a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, leading to optimal canvassing strategies for all feasible voyages of all ships. In the second step, a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model that jointly solves the fleet sizing and mix problem and the voyage planning problem is formulated using the results from the first step. To efficiently solve the proposed MIP model, this paper develops a tailored Benders decomposition method.

	abstract = {Modern communities heavily depend on critical infrastructure networks, such as power, water, gas, telecommunications, and transportation. These infrastructure networks are often dependent upon each other for operation. The interdependence of infrastructure networks makes them more vulnerable to disruptive events, such as malevolent attacks, natural disasters, and random failures. Since daily life requires the effective operation of these networks, it is important that they are able to withstand or recover quickly from a disruption. To return the networks to some desired level of performance, work crews must be scheduled to restore certain disrupted components (nodes or links). The proposed model is a multiobjective mixed-integer programming formulation that integrates 1) the order of link and node recovery, 2) the scheduling of recovery tasks to work crews, and 3) the location of facilities (or resources), where each work crew should originate from to effectively facilitate the recovery process. This study demonstrates the use of the model through an illustrative example of two interdependent infrastructure networks that exhibit behaviors of electric power and water networks. Considering four disruption scenarios, the example illustrates how recovery may change by varying the number of facilities established for work crews in each network. © 2017 IEEE},

	abstract = {This study aims to develop and provide a comprehensive evaluation strategy for schedule-related variations and time-cost analysis for an engineering-procurement-construction (EPC) project. Time-cost analysis is an important aspect of project scheduling, particularly in long-term and costly EPC projects. In this study, a hybrid method is proposed for the time-cost optimization strategy evaluation of a project. Monte Carlo simulation is applied to determine contingency plans and realize the effective management of estimated schedule uncertainties. A mathematical integer linear programming optimization model coded using CPLEX is developed to assess appropriate strategies for project execution under time and cost constraints. A set of project evaluation optimization models considering risk and project crash plan and the relationship between crash cost and delay penalty is also developed for assessing project feasibility. The correlation between project risk and crashing strategy has seldom been evaluated simultaneously in previous research. This work fills this research gap by quantifying the feasibility of a project, with combined data on risk, schedule, and cost as evaluation indicators. It allows project managers to consider management issues and strategies before they implement projects. A practical example with numerical applications is presented to illustrate the contribution of the decision-making support mechanism, and several managerial insights are provided. © 2019 Chao Ou-Yang and Wang-Li Chen.},

	abstract = {We consider scheduling and resource allocation in long-Term evolution (LTE) networks across voice over the LTE (VoLTE) and best-effort data users. The difference between these two is that VoLTE users get scheduling priority to receive their required quality of service. As we show, strict priority causes data services to suffer. We propose new scheduling and resource allocation algorithms to maximize the sum or proportional fair (PF) throughout amongst data users while meeting VoLTE demands. Essentially, we use VoLTE as an example application with both a guaranteed bit-rate and strict application-specific requirement. We first formulate and solve the frame-level optimization problem for throughput maximization; however, this leads to an integer problem coupled across the LTE transmission time intervals (TTIs). We then propose a TTI-level problem to decouple scheduling across TTIs. Finally, we propose a heuristic scheme, with extremely low complexity. The formulations illustrate the details required to realize resource allocation in an implemented standard. The numerical results show that the performance of the TTI-level scheme is very close to that of the frame-level upper bound. Similarly, the heuristic scheme works well compared to TTI-level optimization and a baseline scheduling algorithm. Finally, we show that our PF optimization retains the high fairness index characterizing PF-scheduling. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We consider a wireless network where multiple energy harvesting transmitters communicate with the common receiver in a time-sharing manner. In each slot, a transmitter can either harvest energy or send its data to the receiver. Given a time deadline, the goal is to maximize the sum rate of transmitters under random energy arrivals with both perfect and imperfect channel state information at the receiver. The original sum-rate maximization (SRM) problem is a non-convex mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP). To obtain the optimal scheduling policy, we first reduce the original optimization problem to a convex MINLP and solve it using the generalized Benders decomposition algorithm. We observe that the SRM problem results in an unfair rate allocation among transmitters, i.e., the transmitter closer to the receiver achieves a higher rate than that by the transmitter farther from the receiver. Hence, to induce fairness among transmitters, we consider the minimum-rate maximization (MRM) problem. For the bounded channel estimation error, we obtain a robust scheduling policy by solving the worst-case SRM and MRM problems. Finally, we compare the proposed policies with myopic policies studied in the literature and show that the former outperform the latter in terms of achievable rates. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Traveling Umpire Problem (TUP) is a combinatorial optimization problem concerning the assignment of umpires to the games of a fixed double round-robin tournament. The TUP draws inspiration from the real world multi-objective Major League Baseball (MLB) umpire scheduling problem, but is, however, restricted to the single objective of minimizing total travel distance of the umpires. Several hard constraints are employed to enforce fairness when assigning umpires, making it a challenging optimization problem. The present work concerns a constructive matheuristic approach which focuses primarily on large benchmark instances. A decomposition-based approach is employed which sequentially solves Integer Programming (IP) formulations of the subproblems to arrive at a feasible solution for the entire problem. This constructive matheuristic efficiently generates feasible solutions and improves the best known solutions of large benchmark instances of 26, 28, 30 and 32 teams well within the benchmark time limit. In addition, the algorithm is capable of producing feasible solutions for various small and medium benchmark instances competitive with those produced by other heuristic algorithms. The paper also details experiments conducted to evaluate various algorithmic design parameters such as subproblem size, overlap and objective functions. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

In surgical case scheduling, not only the hospital resources are allocated to surgical cases, but also the start time of performing surgeries is determined based on a sequence of cases in a short-term time horizon. We consider fuzzy numbers for duration times of all stages and hereafter, the problem is called fuzzy surgical case scheduling. Since the operational environment in the problem is similar to no-wait multi-resource fuzzy flexible job shop problem, we consider constraints of the latter for formulating and solving the problem. This problem is strongly an NP-hard optimization problem, hence we employ ant system algorithm to tackle it. The proposed approach is illustrated by detailed examples of three test cases and numerical computational experiments. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with a schedule constructed by first-come-first-service rule in all test instances. Also, a real case is provided from a hospital in Isfahan to evaluate the proposed algorithm. The computational experiments state that the algorithm outperforms hospital planning as well as fuzzy rule, indicating efficiency and capability of the algorithm for optimizing the makespan. © 2019 Sharif University of Technology.

	abstract = {The emergency department is a key element of acute patient flow, but due to high demand and an alternating rate of arriving patients, the department is often challenged by insufficient capacity. Proper allocation of resources to match demand is, therefore, a vital task for many emergency departments. Constrained by targets on patient waiting time, we consider the problem of minimizing the total amount of staff-resources allocated to an emergency department. We test a matheuristic approach to this problem, accounting for both patient flow and staff scheduling restrictions. Using a continuous-time Markov chain, patient flow is modeled as a time-dependent queueing network where inhomogeneous behavior is evaluated using the uniformization method. Based on this modeling approach, we recursively evaluate and allocate staff to the system using integer linear programming until the waiting time targets are respected in all queues of the network. By comparing to discrete-event simulations of the associated system, we show that this approach is adequate for both modeling and optimizing the patient flow. In addition, we demonstrate robustness to the service time distribution and the associated system with multiple classes of patients. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Conferences with contributed talks grouped into multiple concurrent sessions pose an interesting scheduling problem. From an attendee's perspective, choosing which talks to visit when there are many concurrent sessions is challenging since an individual may be interested in topics that are discussed in different sessions simultaneously. The frequency of topically similar talks in different concurrent sessions is, in fact, a common cause for complaint in post-conference surveys. Here, we introduce a practical solution to the conference scheduling problem by heuristic optimization of an objective function that weighs the occurrence of both topically similar talks in one session and topically different talks in concurrent sessions. Rather than clustering talks based on a limited number of preconceived topics, we employ a topic model to allow the topics to naturally emerge from the corpus of contributed talk titles and abstracts. We then measure the topical distance between all pairs of talks. Heuristic optimization of preliminary schedules seeks to balance the topical similarity of talks within a session and the dissimilarity between concurrent sessions. Using an ecology conference as a test case, we find that stochastic optimization dramatically improves the objective function relative to the schedule manually produced by the program committee. Approximate Integer Linear Programming can be used to provide a partially-optimized starting schedule, but the final value of the discrimination ratio (an objective function used to estimate coherence within a session and disparity between concurrent sessions) is surprisingly insensitive to the starting schedule. Furthermore, we show that, in contrast to the manual process, arbitrary scheduling constraints are straightforward to include. We applied our method to a second biology conference with over 1,000 contributed talks plus scheduling constraints. In a randomized experiment, biologists responded similarly to a machine-optimized schedule and a highly modified schedule produced by domain experts on the conference program committee. © 2019 Manda et al.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates how to mitigate the impact of both the co-channel interference and the adjacent channel interference (ACI) in the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) broadcast communication by scheduling and power control. Our objective is to maximize the number of connected vehicles. The optimal joint scheduling and power control problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem with a linear objective and a quadratic constraint. From the joint formulation, we derive (a) the optimal scheduling problem for fixed transmit powers as a Boolean linear programming problem and (b) the optimal power control problem for a fixed schedule as a mixed integer linear programming problem. The near-optimal schedules and power values are computed by solving first (a) and then (b) for smaller-size instances of the problem. To handle larger-size instances of the problem, we propose heuristic scheduling and power control algorithms with less computational complexity. The simulation results indicate that the heuristic scheduling algorithm yields significant performance improvements compared to the baseline block-interleaver scheduler and that performance is further improved by the heuristic power control algorithm. Moreover, the heuristic algorithms perform close to the optimal scheme for small instances of the problem. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Nearly all bitrate adaptive video content delivered today is streamed using protocols that run a purely client based adaptation logic. The resulting lack of coordination may lead to suboptimal user experience and resource utilization. As a response, approaches that include the network and servers in the adaptation process are emerging. In this article, we present an optimized solution for network assisted adaptation specifically targeted to mobile streaming in multi-access edge computing (MEC) environments. Due to NP-Hardness of the problem, we have designed a heuristic-based algorithm with minimum need for parameter tuning and having relatively low complexity. We then study the performance of this solution against two popular client-based solutions, namely Buffer-Based Adaptation (BBA) and Rate-Based Adaptation (RBA), as well as to another network assisted solution. Our objective is two fold: First, we want to demonstrate the efficiency of our solution and second to quantify the benefits of network-assisted adaptation over the client-based approaches in mobile edge computing scenarios. The results from our simulations reveal that the network assisted adaptation clearly outperforms the purely client-based DASH heuristics in some of the metrics, not all of them, particularly, in situations when the achievable throughput is moderately high or the link quality of the mobile clients does not differ from each other substantially. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

In modern 300-mm wafer fabs, front opening unified pods (FOUPs) transfer wafers. The number of FOUPs is limited to avoid a congestion of the Automated Material Handling System. Several orders can be grouped in one FOUP. A nonrestrictive common due date for all the orders is assumed. Only orders that belong to the same family can be processed together in a single FOUP at the same time. We present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for this problem. Moreover, we show that this scheduling problem is NP-hard. We propose several simple heuristics based on dispatching rules and assignment strategies from bin packing. Moreover, genetic algorithms are designed that assign the orders to the set of early and tardy orders, respectively. In addition, a random key genetic algorithm (RKGA) is described that proposes order sequences. The different algorithms are hybridized with job formation and sequencing heuristics. A more specialized algorithm that is based on the generalized assignment problem is presented for the special case of a single order family. Results of computational experiments based on randomly generated problem instances are presented. They demonstrate that the genetic algorithms perform well with respect to solution quality and computing time under a broad range of experimental conditions. © EDP Sciences, ROADEF, SMAI 2018.},

	abstract = {Current research investigates a parallel-tank scheduling problem with hoist and group constraints in printed-circuit-board (PCB) electroplating environment, where the hoist is used as a material handling device and PCBs need to be grouped for further processing. The purpose of the current research is to minimize the makespan and total weighted tardiness of PCB products. The weighted ideal point method is used to combine these two objectives into a single optimization objective. Moreover, a mixed integer programming model is developed to formulate the problem. Since the problem is proved to be NP-hard, a hybrid guided tabu search (HGTS) algorithm is proposed to optimize the objectives. A heuristic method based on small combination sequences called SCS is applied to search the better initial solution. Moreover, a problem-oriented guided neighborhood move strategy is adopted to improve the search efficiency in the proposed HGTS algorithm. The experiments are conducted on different size of problem instances. The performance of the proposed HGTS algorithm is investigated and compared with other existing algorithms. The detailed results indicate that the proposed HGTS algorithm performs better both in objective value and convergence speed. Finally, a real-world case is solved by the proposed HGTS, which validates that the proposed algorithm is effective and useful in solving the practical electroplating scheduling problem. © 2013 IEEE.},

We develop a lightweight temperature model that can be integrated in the MILP model to predict the chip temperature accurately and efficiently. By exploiting the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling capability of modern processors, processor voltage/frequency assignment is also considered in our MILP model. Extensive performance evaluations on synthetic and real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Determining the optimal generator maintenance schedule is generally formulated as a non-linear optimization problem, which leads to difficulties in obtaining the optimal solution when the various power system constraints are considered. This study proposes a generator maintenance scheduling (GMS) method using transformation of mixed integer polynomial programming in a power system incorporating demand response. The GMS method is designed to deal with various system requirements and characteristics of demand response within a power system.

Based on the framework of a smart energy management system (SEMS) using IoT technology, a two-stage optimal scheduling model is proposed to determine the most economic CCHP commercial building system integrated with a three-way valve. In the day-ahead scheduling stage, the schedule is planned using the lowest operating costs of the system. In the real-time correction stage, the correction strategy employs minimum adjustment of the output of each unit. Moreover, the schedule plan is corrected to smooth out fluctuations in the loads and renewable energy resources (RES) in a timely manner to better absorb green energy. The day-ahead scheduling model is a large-scale mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem solved through a linearization method proposed in this study and the mixed integer linear programming method. The real-time correction optimization model is a nonlinear programming problem solved by the quantum genetic algorithm (QGA). A case study is employed to demonstrate that the IoT-based SEMS improves the system automation energy management level and user comfort.

	abstract = {Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is one type of important equipments for conducting ocean exploration missions. The AUV control system typically employs a common communication network to connect various function nodes such as Doppler meter, compass/inertial navigation unit, sonar, water depth sensor, main propulsion, and rudder motor. Each of these function nodes has its own information transmission requirements that need to be served by the limited bandwidth of the common communication network. In order to obtain a good control performance, an elaborate information transmission schedule in the communication network should be planned in such a way that all information transmission requirements in the AUV control system can be satisfied with as less network-induced delay and data packet dropout as possible. This paper proposes a novel network scheduling approach based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the time-triggered architecture for meeting information transmission requirements in the Controller Area Network (CAN) of the AUV control system. The proposed network scheduling approach divides the whole transmission period into a serial of time slices with equal lengths, and defines a large cycle consisting of multiple time slices. For the periodical information transmission, the transmission schedule in one large cycle is determined by solving one nonlinear integer optimization problem with the Genetic Algorithm. This GA-based network scheduling approach maximizes the available bandwidth of each single time slice in all the periodic time slices of the whole schedule period, and aims to achieve a balanced information transmission in the CAN network. Meanwhile, the available bandwidth in each time slice of the whole schedule period is then allocated for the event-triggered information transmission. In this way, the proposed network scheduling approach satisfies the transmission requirements of both periodical and event-triggered information in the AUV. Finally, simulation experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed GA-based network scheduling approach, and verify its performance improvement on an AUV heading motion control using TrueTime toolbox. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Many operation optimization problems such as scheduling and assignment of interest to the automation community are mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems. Because of their combinatorial nature, the effort required to obtain optimal solutions increases drastically as the problem size increases. Such operation optimization problems typically need to be solved several times a day and require short solving times (e.g., 5, 10, or 20 min). The goal is, therefore, to obtain near-optimal solutions with quantifiable quality in a computationally efficient manner. Existing MILP methods, however, suffer from slow convergence and may not efficiently achieve this goal. In this paper, motivated by fast convergence of augmented Lagrangian relaxation (LR), a novel advanced price-based decomposition and coordination 'surrogate absolute-value LR' (SAVLR) approach is developed. Within the method, convergence of our recent surrogate LR (SLR), which has overcome all major difficulties of traditional LR, is significantly improved by penalizing constraint violations by adding 'absolute-value' penalties. Moreover, such penalties are efficiently linearized in a standard way, thereby enabling the use of MILP solvers. By exploiting the beautiful property of exponential reduction of complexity of subproblems upon decomposition, subproblems are efficiently solved and their solutions are efficiently coordinated by updating Lagrangian multipliers. Convergence is then proved under novel adjustment of penalty coefficients. A series of generalized assignment problems is considered, and for these problems, superior performance of SAVLR over other state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice methods is demonstrated. Accompanying CPLEX codes, whereby SAVLR is implemented, are also included. Note to Practitioners - Examples of important problems that arise in automation community include scheduling and assignment problems. Because of their combinatorial nature, the effort required to obtain optimal solutions increases drastically as the problem size increases. Existing mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) methods, however, may suffer from slow convergence and may not efficiently achieve this goal. The new method revolutionizes the way such problems can be solved with major improvements on the overall performance. It is based on our recent breakthrough 'surrogate Lagrangian relaxation' (LR), which has overcome all major difficulties of traditional LR while exploiting the beautiful property of exponential reduction of complexity upon decomposition. To significantly improve convergence while maintaining linearity so as to use MILP solvers, our idea is to penalize violations of relaxed constraints by the infrequently used 'absolute-value' penalty functions. Although not differentiable, absolute-value penalties have the advantage of being exactly linearizable through extra variables and constraints. The difficulties caused by those extra constraints, which couple subproblems, are resolved by adaptive adjustment of penalty coefficients. A series of generalized assignment problems is considered and superior performance of the new method against state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice methods is demonstrated. Accompanying CPLEX codes whereby the new method is implemented are also included. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Limited resources (budget, labor, machinery) have a significant toll on the roads' construction. The question of interest is: given variations of resources over a lengthy construction time, what would be the best construction scheduling plan, or how to optimize the Gantt chart while considering two highly challenging features (1) prerequisite conditions and (2) the interdependency of the benefit of the projects’ completions. We formulate it as a bilevel problem where the objective function is to minimize generalized costs and the lower level accounts for the drivers’ route choice. We employ a solution algorithm based on a supervised learning technique (a linear regression model of machine-learning) and an integer programming problem and it is applied to the datasets of Winnipeg and Chicago. The regression model was found to be a tight approximation which resulted in an efficient algorithm (the CPU time is almost a linear function of the number of iterations). Moreover, the proposed methodology can render promising results (at least locally optimal solutions). This article is the first to formulate the Gantt chart using linear binary constraints and optimize it tailored to real-life case studies. © 2018 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering},

	abstract = {The explosive demands for mobile broadband service bring a major challenge to 5G wireless networks. Device-to-device communication, adopting side links for user-direct communication, is regarded as a main technical source for offloading large volume of mobile traffic from cellular base station. This article investigates the joint power and subcarrier allocation scheme for device-to-device communication in 5G time division duplex systems. In time division duplex system, instead of utilizing an exclusive portion of the precious cellular spectrum, device-to-device pairs reuse the subcarriers occupied by cellular users, thus producing harmful interference to cellular users in both uplink and downlink communication, and strongly limiting the spectrum efficiency of the system. To this end, we focus on the maximization of device-to-device throughput while guaranteeing both uplink and downlink channel quality of service of cellular users as well as device-to-device pairs. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. To make it tractable, we separate the original MINLP problem into two sub problems: power allocation and sub-carrier reusing. The former is to develop optimal power allocation for each device-to-device pair and each cellular user, with the constraints of maximum power and quality of service. It is solved by geometric programming technique in convex optimization method. The latter is derived as a one-to-many matching problem for scheduling multiple subcarriers occupied by cellulars to device-to-device pairs. It is solved by Hungarian method. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves system capacity of the device-to-device underlay network, with quality of service of both device-to-device users and cellular users guaranteed. © The Author(s) 2018.},

	abstract = {Shared autonomous electric vehicles, also known as autonomous mobility on demand systems, are expected to become commercially available by the next decade. In this work we propose a methodology for the optimization of their charging with vehicle-to-grid in parallel with optimized routing and relocation. The methodology presented is based on previous work expanded to include charge optimization. The proposed model optimizes transport service and charging at two different time scales by running two model-predictive control optimization algorithms in parallel. Charging is optimized over longer time scales to minimize both approximate waiting times and electricity costs. Routing and relocation are optimized at shorter time scales to minimize waiting times, with the results of the long-time-scale optimization as charging constraints. This approach allows efficient optimization of both aspects of system operation. The problem is solved as a mixed-integer linear program. A case study using transport and electricity price data for Tokyo is used to test the model. Results show that the system can substantially reduce charging costs without significantly affecting waiting times, with cost reduction dependent on electricity price variability. Vehicle-to-grid is shown to be unsuitable for current electricity and battery prices, however offering substantial savings with price profiles with higher variability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In China, emergency room residents (EMRs) generally face high working intensity. It is particularly important to arrange the working shifts of EMRs in a scientific way to balance their work and rest time. However, in existing studies, most of the scheduling models are based on the individual doctor or nurse as a unit, less considering the actuality of operation and management of emergency department (ED) in large public hospitals in China. Besides, the depiction of the hard and soft constraints of EMR scheduling in China is insufficient. So in order to obtain the scientific and reasonable scheduling shifts, this paper considers various management rules in a hospital, physicians' personal preferences, and the time requirements of their personal learning and living and takes the minimum deviation variables from the soft constraints as the objective function to construct a mixed integer programming model with the doctor group as the scheduling unit. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to determine the weights of deviation variables. Then, IBM ILOG CPLEX 12.8 is used to solve the model. The feasibility and effectiveness of the scheduling method are verified by the actual case from West China Hospital of Sichuan University. The scheduling results can meet the EMRs' flexible work plans and the preferences of the doctor teams for the shifts and rest days. Compared with the current manual scheduling, the proposed method can greatly improve the efficiency and rationality of shift scheduling. In addition, the proposed scheduling method also provides a reference for EMR scheduling in other China's high-grade large public hospitals. © 2019 Mingying Tan et al.},

The three control approaches adopt mixed integer linear programing, conditional value at risk (CVaR), and robust optimization (RO), respectively, aiming to mitigate the renewable generation uncertainties. By comparing the performance and efficiency, the most appropriate control approach for the HCNG penetrated IES is identified. The numerical analysis is conducted to evaluate the three control approaches in different scenarios, where the uncertainty level of renewable energy (within the HCNG penetrated IES) varies. The numerical results show that the CVaR-based approach outperforms the other two approaches when renewable uncertainty is high (approximately 30%). In terms of the cost to satisfy the energy demand, the operational cost of the CVaR-based method is 8.29% lower than the RO one, while the RO-based approach has a better performance when the renewable uncertainty is medium (approximately 5%) and it is operational is 0.62% lower than that of the CVaR model. In both evaluation cases, mixed integer linear programing approach cannot meet the energy demand. This paper also compares the operational performance of the IES with and without HCNG. It is shown that the IES with HCNG can significantly improve the capability to accommodate renewable energy with low upgrading cost. © 2013 IEEE.},

The IHS consists of the Xiluodu Hydropower Project, which ranks second in China, and local plants in multiple recipient regions. It simultaneously provides electricity for Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces and thus meets their complex operation requirements. This paper develops a multi-objective optimization model of maximizing the minimum of total hydropower generation for each provincial power grid while considering network security constraints, electricity contracts, and plant constraints. The purpose is to enhance the minimum power in dry season by using the differences in hydrology and regulating storage of multiple rivers. The TOPSIS method is utilized to handle this multi-objective optimization, where the complex minimax objective function is transformed into a group of easily solved linear formulations. Nonlinearities of the hydropower system are approximatively described as polynomial formulations. The model was used to solve the problem using mixed integer nonlinear programming that is based on the branch-and-bound technique. The proposed method was applied to the monthly generation scheduling of the IHS. Compared to the conventional method, both the total electricity for Guangdong Power Grid and Zhejiang Power Grid during dry season increased by 6% and 4%, respectively. The minimum monthly power also showed a significant increase of 40% and 31%. It was demonstrated that the hydrological differences between Xiluodu Plant and local hydropower plants in receiving power grids can be fully used to improve monthly hydropower generation. © 2019 by the authors.},

It allows the UAV to communicate with multiple ground users in the same time-frequency resources, cyclically. The minimum throughput over all ground users is maximized by jointly optimizing multiuser communication scheduling with cyclical NOMA and UAV trajectory. It turns out that the maximization of minimum throughput is a mixed integer non-linear non-convex optimization problem. In this paper, this problem is decoupled into two blocks, i.e., the optimization of multiuser communication scheduling with cyclical NOMA and the optimization of UAV trajectory. Then, a joint optimization algorithm is proposed based on the block coordinate descent method. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization method can double the minimum throughput, compared with cyclical TDMA. In addition, it reduces users' average access delay and UAV's flying range under the same minimum throughput. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The nurse rostering problem is a well-known optimization problem within the field of operational research which seeks to assign nurses to shifts during a scheduling horizon subject to a set of hard and soft constraints. The nurse rerostering problem, meanwhile, occurs when one or more nurses already scheduled to work cannot be present due to unforeseen events such as, for example, illness. Such absences may render an existing solution infeasible and thus a fast method is required to recreate the roster. The present research explores several novel strategies for rerostering based on relaxations of different problem parameters, including soft constraints and the rescheduling horizon. A general integer programming formulation is developed considering multi-skilled nurses and various constraints commonly found in real-world problems. Secondly, the nurse rerostering problem is explored by rescheduling both the entire scheduling horizon and only a limited part. Additionally, the impact of considering both the soft constraints from the original nurse rostering problem and a relaxation of them is evaluated when solving the nurse rerostering problem. Finally, a variable neighborhood descent heuristic is developed to address the problem without the use of a solver. A computational study on instances adapted from the Second International Nurse Rostering Competition and on real-world instances from a Lisbon hospital demonstrates that the proposed strategies solve realistic large-scale rerostering problems to (near-)optimality in limited computation time. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {With regard to the characteristics of long process, multi-units, cross-logistics and batch production mode, the order planning problem at the steelmaking shop is studied with consideration of the plant-wide process logistics balance. The problem is to allocate the orders to the continuous casters over plan periods such that the semi-finished materials produced by the steelmaking process can be delivered to the downstream hot-rolling and cold-rolling processes on time at required volume. Based on the detailed analysis of unit layout characteristics of the plant-wide process and the order composition information, a hierarchical planning method is proposed to decompose the large-scale planning problem into a set of sub-problems that are sequential solved. For the order batching subproblem, we develop an integer programming model to consolidate orders with small demand into cast-lots by considering the key batching rules. The model is efficiently solved by the optimization solver of CPLEX. For the cast-lot scheduling subproblem, a novel mixed integer programming model is developed by considering the technological constraints, the facility capacity constraints, the logistics balance constraints, the inventory constraints, and the due date constraints. An improved differential evolution algorithm is proposed to solve the cast-lot scheduling subproblem. The main improvement strategy is that the superior individuals within an external archive are further enhanced through a variable neighborhood search mechanism. Computational results on random and practical instances of different scale problems verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2013 IEEE.},

Adding TS and phase shifting transformer to the traditionally static transmission system makes it more flexible. The N-1 secure GTEMS with TS problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model. This problem is hard to solve by off-the-shelf commercial optimization solvers because on the one hand maintenance scheduling variables couple several time intervals together and on the other hand TS variables link normal and contingency states. A solution approach is proposed in this paper to address the problem's high computational burden, which decomposes the problem into a GTEMS subproblem and an optimal TS subproblem and solves them iteratively.

The actual processing time of each job is modeled as a step function of its starting time. An integer programming model is first formulated with the objective of minimizing the total weighted completion time. Since this problem is NP-complete, it becomes an interesting and challenging topic to develop effective approximation algorithms for solving it. The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm has been successfully applied to solve both continuous and combinatorial optimization problems with the advantages of fewer control parameters and ease of implementation. So, an improved discrete artificial bee colony algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm, a dynamic generation mechanism of initial solutions is designed based on job permutation encoding. A genetic algorithm and a modified variable neighborhood search are introduced, respectively, to obtain new solutions for the employed and onlooker bees. A greedy heuristic is proposed to generate the solutions of the scout bees. Finally, to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, an orthogonal test is performed to optimize the parameter settings. Simulation results on different scale problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more effective compared against several presented algorithms from the existing literatures. © 2019 Hua Xuan et al.},

Previous studies on express/local mode generally handle the design of train stopping patterns and schedules independently, which cannot ensure the overall optimality of service provision.

With two types of train services provided, overtaking is allowed and a diverse set of passenger route choices is also incorporated into the proposed model. Linearization techniques are applied to transform this model from nonlinear to linear, which enables the proposed model to be handled by commercial linear solvers.

	abstract = {This paper introduces a scalable framework to coordinate the net load scheduling, sharing, and matching in a neighborhood of residential prosumers connected to the grid. As the prosumers are equipped with smart appliances, photovoltaic panels, and battery energy storage systems, they take advantage of their consumption, generation, and storage flexibilities to exchange energy with neighboring prosumers through negotiating on the amount of energy and its price with an aggregator. The proposed framework comprises two separate multi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization models for prosumers and the aggregator. Prosumers' objective is to maximize the comfort level and minimize the electricity cost at each instant of time, while aggregator intends to maximize its profit and minimize the grid burden by matching prosumers' supply and demand. The evolutionary nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) is employed to generate a set of feasible nondominated solutions to the optimization problem of each individual prosumer and the aggregator. As a bilateral negotiation between each prosumer and the aggregator results in significant computational and communication overhead, a virtual power plant is introduced as an intermediator on behalf of all prosumers to proceed the negotiation with the aggregator in a privacy-preserving noncooperative environment, where no private information is shared. Hence, an automated negotiation approach is embedded in the framework, which enables the negotiators to reactively negotiate on concurrent power and price using private utility functions and preferences. To converge to an acceptable agreement, the negotiation approach follows an alternating-offer production protocol and a reactive utility value concession strategy. The effectiveness of the framework is evaluated by several economic and environmental assessment metrics through a variety of numerical simulations. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

Efficient O&M strategies can help in making informed decisions based on the actual condition of pipelines collected from inspection activities. Municipalities are in dire need of optimizing inspection activities due to the competitive needs for the large number of deteriorated sewer pipelines and limited budget allocated for inspections. This paper presents an optimization model for inspection of deteriorated sewer pipelines using multiobjective optimization technique for which time, cost, and number of inspected sections are optimized using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) is used to reduce the computational complexity of the proposed optimization model. A case study for an existing sewage network in the city of Doha, Qatar, is used to demonstrate the capabilities of the optimization model. The results obtained from implementing the optimization model showed an enhancement of 25.7, 44.4, and 6.5% for time, cost, and number of sections inspected when compared with the results for the same model using the genetic algorithm (GA). Additionally, a cost-saving of 68% could be achieved if the proposed optimization model was deployed instead of the current inspection practices carried out by the municipalities in Doha, Qatar. It is expected that the proposed model could be used to reduce both the cost and time of inspection, especially in cases of limited budget and work forces. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {In this paper we develop a new hybrid Mixed Integer Linear Programming/Constraint Programming (MILP/CP) decomposition method to solve a parallel Continuous Galvanizing Line (CGL) scheduling problem. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total production cost. Unlike common parallel scheduling problems, in this problem sequencing on each CGL is difficult because of the complex production rules of CGLs. Furthermore, all coils are required to be delivered on time, which means an assignment between coils and CGLs may not result into feasible scheduling. The problem is formulated as an integer programming model, but its structure is not suitable for optimization software package to solve. That is the reason why a new hybrid MILP/CP decomposition method is developed. To accelerate the method and reduce the computational time, a heuristic which tries to find the nature of infeasible assignments and obtain more effective cuts is embedded into the framework of the hybrid method. Some properties and a heuristic are employed to tell why the assignment is unfeasible and to derive more effective cuts. 60 instances are randomly generated to simulate actual production data. The new hybrid method is compared with the basic hybrid method without any features proposed in this paper. Numerical results show that the new hybrid method solves all instances in much less computation time than the basic one, especially for large scale instances. © 2018 ISIJ},

	abstract = {The flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP) and multi-row workshop layout problem (MRWLP) are two major focuses in sustainable manufacturing processes. There is a close interaction between them since the FJSSP provides the material handling information to guide the optimization of the MRWLP, and the layout scheme affects the effect of the scheduling scheme by the transportation time of jobs. However, in traditional methods, they are regarded as separate tasks performed sequentially, which ignores the interaction. Therefore, developing effective methods to deal with the multi-objective energy-aware integration of the FJSSP and MRWLP (MEIFM) problem in a sustainable manufacturing system is becoming more and more important. Based on the interaction between FJSSP and MRWLP, the MEIFM problem can be formulated as a multi-objective bi-level programming (MOBLP) model. The upper-level model for FJSSP is employed to minimize the makespan and total energy consumption, while the lower-level model for MRWLP is used to minimize the material handling quantity. Because the MEIFM problem is denoted as a mixed integer non-liner programming model, it is difficult to solve it using traditional methods. Thus, this paper proposes an improved multi-objective hierarchical genetic algorithm (IMHGA) to solve this model. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified through comparative experiments. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This work addresses a tactical railway traffic scheduling problem focused on the optimization of train sequencing and routing decisions and timing decisions related to short-term maintenance works in a railway network subject to disturbed process times. This is modeled as a mixed-integer linear programming formulation in which the traffic flow and track maintenance variables, constraints and objectives are integrated under a stochastic environment. The resulting bi-objective optimization problem is to minimize the deviation from a scheduled plan and to maximize the number of aggregated maintenance works under stochastic disturbances. The two objectives require to schedule competitive train operations versus maintenance works on the same infrastructure elements. Computational experiments are performed on a realistic railway network. We measure the quality of the integrated solutions in terms of their robustness to stochastic perturbations of the train travel times and of the maintenance works. Pareto optimal methods are compared for the bi-objective problem. We also evaluate the impact of introducing routing stability constraints in order to force the trains to keep the same route among the different stochastic disturbed scenarios. The experiments show that forcing the routing stability reduces the routing flexibility and the ability to optimize the two performance indicators when dealing with stochastic disturbances. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper presents a mixed receding horizon control (RHC) strategy for the optimal scheduling of a battery energy storage system (BESS) in a hybrid PV and wind power plant while satisfying multiple operational constraints. The overall optimisation problem was reformulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, aimed at minimising the total operating cost of the entire system. The cost function of this MILP is composed of the profits of selling electricity, the cost of purchasing ancillary services for undersupply and oversupply, and the operation and maintenance cost of each component. To investigate the impacts of day-ahead and hour-ahead forecasting for battery optimisation, four forecasting methods, including persistence, Elman neural network, wavelet neural network and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), were applied for both day-ahead and hour-ahead forecasting. Numerical simulations demonstrated the significant increased efficiency of the proposed mixed RHC strategy, which improved the total operation profit by almost 29% in one year, in contrast to the day-ahead RHC strategy. Moreover, the simulation results also verified the significance of using more accurate forecasting techniques, where ARIMA can reduce the total operation cost by almost 5% during the whole year operation when compared to the persistence method as the benchmark. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The generation management concept for non-interconnected island (NII) systems is traditionally based on simple, semi-empirical operating rules dating back to the era before the massive deployment of renewable energy sources (RES), which do not achieve maximum RES penetration, optimal dispatch of thermal units and satisfaction of system security criteria. Nowadays, more advanced unit commitment (UC) and economic-dispatch (ED) approaches based on optimization techniques are gradually introduced to safeguard system operation against severe disturbances, to prioritize RES participation and to optimize dispatch of the thermal generation fleet. The main objective of this paper is to comparatively assess the traditionally applied priority listing (PL) UC method and a more sophisticated mixed integer linear programming (MILP) UC optimization approach, dedicated to NII power systems. Additionally, to facilitate the comparison of the UC approaches and quantify their impact on systems security, a first attempt is made to relate the primary reserves capability of each unit to the maximum acceptable frequency deviation at steady state conditions after a severe disturbance and the droop characteristic of the unit’s speed governor. The fundamental differences between the two approaches are presented and discussed, while daily and annual simulations are performed and the results obtained are further analyzed. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {With the development of network technology such as software-defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV), Internet service providers (ISPs) are increasingly placing the virtual network function(VNF) instances at the network edge to provide network service. However, there are some issues to be tackled in the distributed SDN/NFV enabled cloud. Firstly, VNF instances require to be chained in predefined order to provide network services. It is a challenge to optimally select and chain VNF instances from the multi-instances. Moreover, due to the capacity limitation of the distributed edge nodes. The capacity of the Virtual Machines (VMs) that host VNFs should be proactively adjusted to cope with traffic demands. Since most existing works ignore the vertical capacity scaling problem in routing commodities with Service Function Chain (SFC) requests. In this paper, a fine-grained scheduling scheme at VM-level is proposed. Firstly, we formulate the SFC chaining problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model aiming to embed SFC requests with minimum estimated latency cost. Furthermore, we formulate the adaptive VNF resource allocation (VNF-AR) problem as a convex optimization. The theoretical optimal capacity for each VM can be derived from the Karush-Kuhn Tucker (KKT) conditions. At last, a novel joint optimization approach of VNF chaining and adaptive scaling (VNF-CAS) is proposed to efficiently embed the SFC requests. Performance evaluation shows that VNF-CAS can achieve better performance in SFC requests acceptance rate, average effective throughput, average load utilization and VM load balancing when it is compared with other algorithms in existing works. © 2019 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.

	abstract = {Solving the Unit Commitment problem is an important step in optimally dispatching the available generation and involves two stages—deciding which generators to commit, and then deciding their power output (economic dispatch). The Unit Commitment problem is a mixed-integer combinational optimization problem that traditional optimization techniques struggle to solve, and metaheuristic techniques are better suited. Dragonfly algorithm (DA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are two such metaheuristic techniques, and recently a hybrid (DA-PSO), to make use of the best features of both, has been proposed. The original DA-PSO optimization is unable to solve the Unit Commitment problem because this is a mixed-integer optimization problem. However, this paper proposes a new and improved DA-PSO optimization (referred to as iDA-PSO) for solving the unit commitment and economic dispatch problems. The iDA-PSO employs a sigmoid function to find the optimal on/off status of units, which is the mixed-integer part of obtaining the Unit Commitment problem. To verify the effectiveness of the iDA-PSO approach, it was tested on four different-sized systems (5-unit, 6-unit, 10-unit, and 26-unit systems). The unit commitment, generation schedule, total generation cost, and time were compared with those obtained by other algorithms in the literature. The simulation results show iDA-PSO is a promising technique and is superior to many other algorithms in the literature. © 2019 by the Authors.},

This general situation has relevant examples in scheduling (preemption), routing (split delivery), cutting and telecommunications, just to mention a few. However, the general case in which variables integrality can be relaxed at cost of introducing a general penalty was not discussed before. As a case study, we consider the possibly simplest combinatorial optimization problem, namely the classical Knapsack Problem. We introduce the Fractional Knapsack Problem with Penalties (FKPP), a variant of the knapsack problem in which items can be split at the expense of a penalty depending on the fractional quantity. We analyze relevant properties of the problem, present alternative mathematical models, and analyze their performance from a theoretical viewpoint. In addition, we introduce a Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme for the approximate solution of the general problem, and an improved dynamic programming approach that computes the optimal solution in one relevant case. We computationally test the proposed models and algorithms on a large set of instances derived from benchmarks from the literature. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the optimal configuration and control of electric vehicle aggregators equipped with smart meters in the regional power distribution network. The mixed optimization of configuration and control is originally formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with the stochastic operation model of EV aggregations. The controllable charging load is calculated by using a queuing model with non-homogeneous Poission process and integrated into the reliability constrained economic dispatch of the power system. Benders decomposition technique is adopted to lessen the dimensional and computational complexities introduced by the charging control of massive EVs. The total operating cost is minimized in the master problem, and charging plan for each individual EV is made by EVA in the sub-problems. In the case of any subproblem violations in the feasibility check of the optimal solution, Benders cuts are produced and added to the master problem. The proposed method is demonstrated in a 123-bus test network and EVA optimization results are compared with the direct control of EV aggregations for validating the effectiveness of the proposed method in the electrification of automobiles. © 2013 IEEE.},

The complexity of this problem has increased in recent years given the emergence of new participants such as large penetration of plug-in electric vehicles. In this paper, a new model is established for simultaneously considering the day-ahead hourly based power system scheduling and a significant number of plug-in electric vehicles charging and discharging behaviours. For solving the problem, a novel hybrid mixed coding meta-heuristic algorithm is proposed, where V-shape symmetric transfer functions based binary particle swarm optimization are employed. The impact of transfer functions utilised in binary optimization on solving unit commitment and plug-in electric vehicle integration are investigated in a 10 unit power system with 50,000 plug-in electric vehicles. In addition, two unidirectional modes including grid to vehicle and vehicle to grid, as well as a bi-directional mode combining plug-in electric vehicle charging and discharging are comparatively examined. The numerical results show that the novel symmetric transfer function based optimization algorithm demonstrates competitive performance in reducing the fossil fuel cost and increasing the scheduling flexibility of plug-in electric vehicles in three intelligent scheduling modes. © 2018},

The goal is to identify a topology of the power grid that minimizes the cost of the system operation while satisfying the physical and operational constraints. Most of the existing methods for the problem are based on first converting the OTS into a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) or mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP), and then iteratively solving a series of its convex relaxations. The performance of these methods depends heavily on the strength of the MILP or MIQP formulations. In this paper, it is shown that finding the strongest variable upper and lower bounds to be used in an MILP or MIQP formulation of the OTS based on the big-M or McCormick inequalities is NP-hard. Furthermore, it is proven that unless P=NP, there is no constant-factor approximation algorithm for constructing these variable bounds. Despite the inherent difficulty of obtaining the strongest bounds in general, a simple bound strengthening method is presented to strengthen the convex relaxation of the problem when there exists a connected spanning subnetwork of the system with fixed lines. With the proposed bound strengthening method, remarkable improvements in the runtime of the mixed-integer solvers and the optimality gaps of the solutions are achieved for medium-A nd large-scale real-world systems. © 2018 IEEE.},

Subsequently, other multi-objective optimization methods developed to optimize time, cost, quality or safety have been developed. New types of contracting methods designed by governments, included maximizing construction quality while minimizing its time and cost. Recently, due to the fact that the construction industry suffers from more accidents of greater severity than other industrial sectors, safety has become one of the four critical elements that contribute to project success. The project scheduling literature largely concentrates on the generation of a precedence and resource feasible schedule that optimizes the scheduling objective and that should serve as a baseline schedule for executing the project. However, these models do not allow to analyse alternative work plans that consider the trade-offs between time, cost, quality, and safety. In this paper, an integer linear programming problem is applied to a decision-CPM network in order to obtain an overall optimum including time, cost, quality and safety in a road building project. Using this type of model, the effects of alternative methods of performing the tasks can be considered and a greater degree of interaction between the planning and scheduling phases of a project is obtained. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Home care services are in high demand given how they are steadily becoming the primary source of care for the elderly. Powerful decision support tools are indispensable for effectively managing available staff in the context of ever-increasing demand for care and limited caregiver availability. This paper advances home care literature by introducing flexible task durations, thereby enabling tasks to be completed faster and ultimately more care to be scheduled. This new concept, which originates from practice, introduces an additional decision to be made when creating a schedule, thereby greatly increasing the scheduling complexity. Consequently, this paper introduces a new optimization-based decision support model which allows for scheduling with flexible task duration, as well as other types of flexibility. A computational study quantifies the impact of: (i) scheduling with a finer task granularity thereby enabling accurate prioritization of high and low priority care, (ii) flexibility in task duration enabling tasks to be completed faster and more care to be scheduled, and (iii) increasing the number of different locations visited by a caregiver thereby enabling a trade-off between the number of serviced clients and caregiver workload. A new publicly available real-world data set is used, obtained directly from home care organizations operating in Flanders. Analysis of the computational results demonstrates that significant improvements in operational efficiency may be realized with minimal effort required by organizations. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm's performance is confirmed by comparison against the bounds obtained by solving an integer programming formulation of the problem. Finally, a management policy scheme is proposed which, when gradually implemented in a home care organization, results in a more efficient and therefore cost-effective deployment of its workforce. © 2018},

It is the first to study the energy-conscious DRCFJSP with turn OFF/ON strategy. Different from the classical FJSP, the worker flexibility is considered in DRCFJSP. First, in order to solve this problem, we propose two mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models based on two modeling ideas, namely, idle time and idle energy. Because DRCFJSP is NP-hard, then we propose an efficient variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm. In the proposed VNS algorithm, eight neighborhood structures are designed to generate neighboring solutions. In addition, four energy-saving decoding approaches are specifically designed, in which two energy-saving strategies, namely, postponing strategy and turn OFF/ON strategy are designed. Finally, the MILP model, the energy-conscious decoding methods, and the VNS are evaluated on numerical tests, whose effectiveness is shown by the experimental results. The experimental results show that the MILP model based on idle energy performs better than the model based on idle time idea, and the greedy hybrid decoding method outperforms the other three decoding methods. Moreover, the proposed VNS with eight neighborhood structures is a very competitive algorithm for the energy-conscious DRCFJSP. © 2013 IEEE.},

In this model, the upper-level sub-problem is formulated to minimize the IMG net costs, while the lower-level aims to maximize the profits of the BSS under real-time pricing environments determined by demand responses in the upper-level decision. To solve the model, a hybrid algorithm, called JAYA-BBA, is put forward by combining a real/integer-coded JAYA algorithm and the branch and bound algorithm (BBA), in which the JAYA and BBA are respectively employed to address the upper- and lower- level sub-problems, and the bi-level model is eventually solved through alternate iterations between the two levels.

The determination of the optimal sizes of the photovoltaic arrays, energy storage systems and inverters, and the optimal scheduling of power exchanges are achieved through the formulation of a mixed integer linear programming problem. Furthermore, the Nash bargaining method is used in order to fairly distribute the cooperation profits among the participants. The proposed approach achieves the reduction of the microgrid's (MG's) cost and carbon emissions compared to noncooperative approaches, and promotes the enhancement of the MG's energy sufficiency by allowing energy exchanges among buildings with energy surplus and buildings with energy deficit.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the problem of scheduling a set of jobs with arbitrary sizes and non-zero release times on a set of unrelated parallel batch machines with different capacities so as to minimize the total flow time of the jobs. The total flow time, defined as the total amount of time that the jobs spend in the system (i.e. the period between the job release dates and its completion times), is one of the most important objectives in scheduling problems, since it can lead to stable utilization of resources and reduction of working-in-process inventory. Motivated by the computational complexity of the problem, a simple and effective iterated greedy (IG) algorithm is proposed to solve it. The IG algorithm uses an efficient greedy heuristic to reconstruct solutions and a local search procedure to further enhance the solution quality. In attempting to obtain optimal solutions for small-medium size instances, a mixed integer programming model for the problem is also presented. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on a comprehensive set of small, medium and large benchmark of randomly generated instances, and is compared to three benchmark meta-heuristic algorithms (Discrete Differential Evolution, Ant Colony Optimization and Simulated Annealing) recently proposed for similar parallel batch machine scheduling problems. Experimental results and statistical tests show that the proposed algorithm is significantly superior in performance than the other algorithms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Printed circuit board (PCB) assembly lines are significant to produce a variety of electronic products. PCB manufacturing industries tend to move towards automated and complex manufacturing system due to an increase in the customer demand for more sophisticated products. PCB assembly process involves highly interrelated levels of planning and scheduling problems. Therefore, the current research investigates multi-level planning and scheduling of PCB assembly lines, which include line assignment to the PCB models, component allocations to machines, and component placement sequencing by machines on PCB boards. A mixed integer-programming model is developed to integrate the planning and scheduling problem of parallel PCB assembly lines to maximize the net profit. A hybrid spider monkey optimization (HSMO) algorithm is proposed to solve the multi-level planning and scheduling problem. The performance of the proposed HSMO algorithm is compared to artificial bee colonial (ABC), genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and simulated annealing (SA) algorithms. Moreover, the proposed HSMO algorithm is validated against ABC, GA, PSO, and SA algorithms with the case problem taken from well-reputed PCB manufacturing industry in China. The computation experiments indicate that the proposed HSMO algorithm can achieve good near-optimal solutions when compared with the other-mentioned four algorithms based on performance and efficiency for benchmark problems and real case problem. © 2013 IEEE.},

This problem is formulated as a 0–1 mixed-integer program (MIP), taking into account several realistic constraints, including safety separation standards, wide time-windows, and constrained position shifting, with the objective of maximizing the total throughput. Varied scenarios of large scale realistic instances of this problem, which is NP-hard in general, are computationally difficult to solve with the direct use of commercial solver as well as existing state-of-the-art dynamic programming method. The design of the algorithm is based on a recently introduced data-splitting algorithm which uses the divide-and-conquer paradigm, wherein the given set of flights is divided into several disjoint subsets, each of which is optimized using 0–1 MIP while ensuring the optimality of the entire set. Computational results show that the difficult instances can be solved in real-time and the solution is efficient in comparison to the commercial solver and dynamic programming, using both sequential, as well as parallel, implementation of this pleasingly parallel algorithm. © 2018},

	abstract = {Modern trams typically run along semi-exclusive right-of-way. Although tram lanes isolate trams from other traffic in the running sections, the operation process will be affected by signal control. To improve the service quality of trams and reduce the negative impact on intersections caused by bidirectional priority requests, we propose a timetable optimization method for a single two-way tram line based on active transit signal priority strategy. Combining with the characteristics of bidirectional signal priority strategy, trams can pass through the intersections without stopping by adjusting the running times and dwell times. A multiobjective optimization model of a tram timetable is established to minimize the total travel time, dwell time increment, and negative effect of the signal priority strategy. For obtaining a timetable with equal satisfaction for the three objectives, we adopt the fuzzy mathematical programming approach to transform the problems into mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems, which can be solved by using standard solvers. The case study of Nanjing Qilin Tram Line 1 shows that the timetable optimization method designed in this paper can effectively improve the service efficiency of trams, and reduce the negative impact of the signal priority strategy on social vehicles. These empirical findings can give us some useful insights on the optimum design of tram timetable. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the wireless Internet of Things (IoT) networks with resource-constrained devices, fog computing has been introduced to deal with the computation-intensive applications at the edges of the networks. While fog computing decreases the computation delay and fronthaul traffic data, it also brings the severe challenge on complex resource allocation of the available computation and communication resources under the stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we investigate the problem of tasks scheduling and heterogeneous resource allocation for multiple devices in the wireless IoT networks. The IoT devices that collect a massive amount of data need to make proper offloading decision to transfer the data to the fog computing nodes (FNs). Moreover, to support a massive number of device connections and transfer a huge amount of data with low latency and limited resource, we consider the deployment of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in IoT networks, which enables multiple IoT devices to simultaneously transmit data to the same FN at the same time, frequency, and code domain. We jointly optimize the allocation of resource blocks and transmit power of multiple IoT devices, subject to the respective QoS requirements. Furthermore, the optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem to minimize the system energy consumption. Since it is an NP-hard problem, we introduce an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) to solve it. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves good performance in throughput, delay, outage probability, and energy consumption. © 2013 IEEE.},

That is, the utility company at the upper level devotes to maximize the profit of electricity sale by tuning dynamic retail electricity prices, while large industrial customers at the lower level minimize their power consumption costs by optimally scheduling tasks and generation outputs of self-provided power plants. Specifically, the task scheduling problem of large industrial customers is formulated as a modified continuous-time mixed-integer linear programing (MILP) problem, for effectively handling the exact start time and cancellation of tasks as well as optimally deploying and executing tasks of large industrial customers. A hybrid optimization algorithm by integrating genetic algorithm (GA) and MILP is proposed for addressing computational complexity of the proposed bi-level optimization problem. That is, GA is used to solve the upper level problem, while the lower level scheduling problem is solved by a commercial MILP optimizer. Numerical case results show that the proposed method can effectively increase the profit of the utility company, while improving electricity consumption patterns and reducing average power consumption costs of large industrial customers. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In cloud storage, the digital data is stored in logical storage pools, backed by heterogeneous physical storage media and computing infrastructure that are managed by a cloud service provider (CSP). One of the key advantages of cloud storage is its elastic pricing mechanism, in which the users need only pay for the resources/services they actually use, e.g., depending on the storage capacity consumed, the number of file accesses per month, and the negotiated service level agreement. To balance the tradeoff between service performance and cost, CSPs often employ different storage tiers, for instance, cold storage and hot storage. Storing data in hot storage incurs high storage cost yet delivers low access latency, whereas cold storage is able to inexpensively store massive amounts of data and thus provides lower cost with higher latency. In this paper, we address a major challenge confronting the CSPs utilizing such tiered storage architecture-how to maximize their overall profit over a variety of storage tiers that offer distinct characteristics, as well as file placement and access request scheduling policies. To this end, we propose a scheme where the CSP offers a two-stage auction process for: 1) requesting storage capacity and 2) requesting accesses with latency requirements. Our two-stage bidding scheme provides a hybrid storage and access optimization framework with the objective of maximizing the CSP's total net profit over four dimensions: file acceptance decision, placement of accepted files, file access decision and access request scheduling policy. The proposed optimization is a mixed-integer nonlinear program that is hard to solve. We propose an efficient heuristic to relax the integer optimization and to solve the resulting nonlinear stochastic programs. The algorithm is evaluated under different scenarios and with different storage system parameters, and insightful numerical results are reported by comparing the proposed approach with other profit-maximization models. We see a profit increase of over 60% of our proposed method compared to other baseline algorithms in certain simulation scenarios. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Off-grid microgrids constitute an increasingly viable alternative to grid extension for rural electrification. Thanks to significant reductions in hardware cost, energy cost for off-grid users in areas sparsely covered by the national grid has become competitive with grid-connection once infrastructural costs are accounted for. Microgrids offer advantages also from an environmental and social point of view, featuring generation systems with high renewable penetration and facilitating the involvement of local communities in development projects. To further enhance microgrids economic competitiveness, it is necessary to devise innovative control strategies and design algorithms, that can ensure an optimal operating performance at the lowest overall cost. In this paper we present a new predictive design and dispatch optimization algorithm based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). The new method is compared to a previously developed heuristic methodology, applying both to the design and yearly performance estimation of local microgrids, characterized on the basis of real data relative to a sub-Saharan African region. The potential advantages of including the proposed microgrid design method in a regional electrification planning model are illustrated in a realistic case example. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of how best to coordinate, or "stack," energy storage services in systems that lack centralized markets. Specifically, its focus is on how to coordinate transmission-level congestion relief with local, distribution-level objectives. We describe and demonstrate a unified communication and optimization framework for performing this coordination. The congestion relief problem formulation employs a weighted ℓ1-norm objective. This approach determines a set of corrective actions, i.e., energy storage injections and conventional generation adjustments, that minimize the required deviations from a planned schedule. To exercise this coordination framework, we present two case studies. The first is based on a 3-bus test system, and the second on a realistic representation of the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. The results indicate that the scheduling methodology provides congestion relief, cost savings, and improved renewable energy integration. The large-scale case study informed the design of a live demonstration carried out in partnership with the University of Washington, Doosan GridTech, Snohomish County PUD, and the Bonneville Power Administration. The goal of the demonstration was to test the feasibility of the scheduling framework in a production environment with real-world energy storage assets.

	abstract = {Small cells (SCs) mounted on top of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a promising solution to boost the capacity in hotspot areas. However, the adoption of UAV-SCs involves the planning of their missions over time, which includes the scheduling of recharging actions of each UAV-SC at ground sites. Typically, the energy needed to recharge UAV-SCs is derived from the grid, which can be coupled with microgeneration exploiting renewable energy sources (e.g., solar panels). In this architecture, the energy that is locally produced can be either sold to the grid or used to recharge the UAV-SCs. On the other hand, when the energy from microgeneration is insufficient for recharging the UAV-SCs, additional energy can be bought from the grid. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between maximizing the throughput provided by the UAV-SCs over a set of areas, maximizing energy sold to the grid, and maximizing energy bought from the grid. The proposed model, MaxUAVProfit, is designed to (i) plan the UAV-SCs missions as a sequence of positions and actions in 3D space vs. time, (ii) manage the grid-connected microgeneration, and (iii) control the amount of throughput received by each hotspot. We then evaluate the MaxUAVProfit in a realistic scenario, which is based on the measurement of real cellular metrics and a realistic UAV-SC energy consumption model. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of the MaxUAVProfit with respect to other competing solutions, which include either optimization of microgeneration or maximization of the area throughput. © 2013 IEEE.},

We formulate optimization of the balancing power bidding strategy as a mixed-integer nonlinear program considering both price forecasts for the ancillary service market and hourly varying spot market prices. We solve this two-stage approach by decomposition into a nonlinear bidding problem and a mixed-integer linear scheduling problem. We consider aluminum electrolysis participating in the German primary balancing market. We show savings in weekly production costs of 5–20% compared to stationary operation. The savings due to the optimal bidding strategy are up to twice the savings from pure exploitation of electricity spot market price spreads. We thus demonstrate that energy-intense processes can systematically take advantage of highly profitable demand-side management measures beyond a spot market price adjusted production. © 2018},

A mixed integer linear programming model is developed to solve the problem optimally. Since the proposed research problem is proven to be NP-hard, a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm based on the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm, enhanced with neighbourhood search is developed to heuristically solve the problem. Since the objective is a non-regular, a timing algorithm is developed to find the best schedule for each sequence provided by the metaheuristic algorithm. A lower bounding method is also developed by reformulating the problem as a Dantzig-Wolf decomposition model to evaluate the performance of the proposed PSO algorithm. The computational results, based on using available test problems in the literature, demonstrate that the proposed PSO algorithm and the lower bounding method are quite effective, especially in the instances with loose due date.

Faced with unexpected disasters, it is urgent to allocate oil products to the stricken areas. By taking the shortest emergency scheduling time and the lowest cost as the objective functions, this paper develops a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model accounting for multiple supply sites, multiple disaster sites, multiple transportation modes, uncertain demand and effectiveness of scheduling paths. To obtain the optimal scheduling scheme, the augmented ϵ-constraint method (AUGMECON) is combined with a robust optimization approach to solve the model. Finally, the model is applied to an emergency scheduling problem under the earthquake that occurred in Sichuan China in 2008. The results show that the model can not only effectively work out the emergency scheduling problem of oil products under demand uncertainty, but also ensure the robustness and optimality of the solution. Moreover, a comparison between single-objective and multi-objective models, as well as the analysis under different control parameters and disturbing parameters, are provided to validate the proposed model. © 2013 IEEE.},

When aggregated and properly managed EV batteries can provide important ancillary services such as peak load levelling and frequency regulation. EVs can also provide various demand response services and help in renewable energy integration. The major challenge for having a wide-scale V2G system to effectively provide the above services is the availability of power which is limited by the battery degradation and the battery cycle life. The battery cycle life is inversely proportional to the charge/discharge cycles the battery goes through during its operation. Therefore, the charge/discharge operation should be optimized to maximize the benefit for both the EV owners and the grid operator. In this paper, we develop an EV charge/discharge optimization model that incorporates frequency regulation and electricity prices from both real and forecasting models into the objective function of the model. We develop a prediction and optimization model to reflect the effects of dynamic and static electricity and regulation prices on the battery cycle life.

We also propose an exact solution approach based on a dynamic programming algorithm to a special case of this problem motivated by real-world practice. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Soiling of heliostat surfaces due to local climate has a direct impact on their optical efficiency and therefore a direct impact on the productivity of the Solar Power Tower plant. Cleaning techniques applied are dependent on plant construction and current schedules are normally developed considering heliostat layout patterns, providing sub-optimal results. In this paper, a method to optimise cleaning schedules is developed, with the objective of maximising energy generated by the plant. First, an algorithm finds a cleaning schedule by solving an integer program, which is then used as a starting solution in an exchange heuristic. Since the optimisation problems are of large size, a p-median type heuristic is performed to reduce the problem dimensionality by clustering heliostats into groups to be cleaned in the same period. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Timetable regularity, that is, equability of headways, is an important measure for service quality in high frequency public transit systems, assuring an evenly distributed passenger load as well as improving product attractiveness. However, to be feasible during daily operation a timetable may also have to adhere to other planning requirements, such as departure time coordination with other service providers or deliberately short headways to reduce the passenger load of follow-up vehicles. In this article, a disjunctive program formulation combining aspects of two previous optimization models is proposed, to generate regular public transit timetables adhering to planning requirements. The modeled requirements not only allow for the consideration of feasibility constraints from daily operations, but also for the consideration of simultaneous departures for transfer connections, an objective traditionally opposed to regularity. To show its applicability the approach is applied to two models of artificial transit networks as well as to models of the public transit network of Cologne, Germany. The results show that the proposed formulation can be used to generate timetables for network instances of realistic size in acceptable time. For networks consisting of multiple connected components it is shown that a decomposition approach can significantly reduce run times. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

To mitigate this, power systems need flexible resources. This paper investigates the potential for wind power to provide flexible ramping products in the real-time market, an additional value stream to the energy it provides. The proposed model for wind power's strategic offering is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem with wind profit maximization at the upper level and the independent system operator's economic dispatch-considering both the energy balance and the flexible ramping requirement to counter uncertainty-at the lower level. This bi-level model is converted to a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) by recasting the lower level problem with its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions. Then, through strong duality theory and the big-M method, the MPEC model is converted to a mixed-integer linear programming model. The opportunity cost and the price for wind power-providing ramping products are analyzed. Numerical examples based on a 5-bus network are presented to verify the proposed model and concept. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates resource modeling and management for a base station (BS) providing mobile edge computing (MEC) service. In the proposed modeling, BS is recognized as a queueing network consisting of multiple multi-type servers. The uplink transmission users, downlink transmission users, and MEC users with different priority levels are jointly considered. It is assumed that their service-requests arrive dynamically and are also served dynamically. With such a general resource modeling, the interaction among these users can be analyzed based on the queueing network theory. The average delay of each service-type with different priority levels is derived. Based on the derived results, two resource management optimization problems are formulated and solved from the perspective of a service provider. The revenue brought by MEC services is first maximized by doing user admission control while provisioning the quality-of-service (QoS) of all admitted users with the given amount of communication and computation resources. Then, the capital expenditure of resource deployment is minimized by satisfying the QoS of all users. It is formulated as an integer programming problem. An algorithm is developed to solve it, which can help service providers to determine the optimal amount of communication and computation resources to be placed in a BS to guarantee QoS for all users at a minimal total capital expenditure. Computer simulations are done to validate all analysis and comparisons are made with BS serving multi-type users of single priority level. Through comparison, an insight is gained that service providers can obtain more revenue or spare less capital expenditure by differentiating the user priority levels. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Energy saving and system reliability are two crucial issues for designing modern multiprocessor systems. There has been reliability-aware power management with dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS) schemes in recent studies. However, they are limited to optimization under the impact of DVFS on energy and reliability and have not considered reducing the non-negligible leakage energy consumption. In this paper, we focus on co-management of system reliability and total energy for applications with precedence constrained tasks on heterogeneous multiprocessor real-time systems. We first investigate the impact of energy management techniques on both reliability and energy of the systems using task recovery for fault tolerance and then propose an Energy-efficient Fault-tolerant Scheduling (EFS) scheme integrated with power mode management, which can mitigate the negative impact of DVFS on system reliability. To obtain the optimal energy-efficient reliability-guaranteed scheduling for pre-mapped applications on systems considering various realistic issues, we build mixed integer linear programing formulations with the proposed EFS scheme. To address mapping and scheduling for energy-efficiency and fault-tolerance, we finally develop a framework implemented by a List-based Binary Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The extensive comparative evaluations for synthetic and realistic benchmarks show that our approaches outperform several related studies in terms of energy consumption and system reliability. © 2013 IEEE.},

Stochastic behaviors for wind power, natural inflow, electric power, and energy demand are modeled using chance-constrained programming and then converted into equivalent deterministic formulations to reduce the calculation complexity. Besides, to achieve the integrated optimization for generation and maintenance scheduling, detailed maintenance constraints as well as the coupling constraints of 2 tasks are considered in the scheduling model. In addition, 2 types of time indexes are used to coordinate the different time interval requirements for them. Finally, the proposed mixed integer linear programming model is solved by commercial software CPLEX.

This paper investigates a bi-objective rescue vehicle scheduling problem for multi-point forest fires, which aims to optimally dispatch a limited number of fire engines to extinguish fires. The objectives are to minimize the total fire-extinguishing time and the number of dispatched fire engines. For this problem, we first develop an integer program that is an improved and simplified version of an existing one. After exploring some properties of the problem, we develop an exact dynamic programming algorithm and a fast greedy heuristic method. Computational results for a real-life instance, and benchmark and large-size randomly generated instances confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model and algorithms.

	abstract = {The two-dimensional non-oriented bin packing problem with due dates packs a set of rectangular items, which may be rotated by 90° into identical rectangular bins. The bins have equal processing times. An item's lateness is the difference between its due date and the completion time of its bin. The problem packs all items without overlap as to minimize maximum lateness Lmax. The paper proposes a tight lower bound that enhances an existing bound on Lmax by 31.30% for 24.07% of the benchmark instances and matches it in 30.87% cases. Moreover, it models the problem via mixed integer programming (MIP), and solves small-sized instances exactly using CPLEX. It approximately solves larger-sized instances using a two-stage heuristic. The first stage constructs an initial solution via a first-fit heuristic that applies an iterative constraint programming (CP)-based neighborhood search. The second stage, which is iterative too, approximately solves a series of assignment low-level MIPs that are guided by feasibility constraints. It then enhances the solution via a high-level random local search. The approximate approach improves existing upper bounds by 27.45% on average, and obtains the optimum for 33.93% of the instances. Overall, the exact and approximate approaches find the optimum in 39.07% cases. The proposed approach is applicable to complex problems. It applies CP and MIP sequentially, while exploring their advantages, and hybridizes heuristic search with MIP. It embeds a new lookahead strategy that guards against infeasible search directions and constrains the search to improving directions only; thus, differs from traditional lookahead beam searches. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Energy Management System (EMS) applications of modern power networks like microgrids have to respond to a number of stringent challenges due to current energy revolution. Optimal resource dispatch tasks must be handled with specific regard to the addition of new resource types and the adoption of novel modeling considerations. In addition, due to the comprehensive changes concerning the multi cell grid structure, new policies should be fulfilled via microgrids’ EMS. At the same time achieving a variety of (conflicting) goals in different microgrids requires a universal and a multi criteria optimization tool. Few of recent works in this area have considered the different perspectives of network operation with high amount of constraints and decision criteria. In this paper two dispatch-optimizers for a centralized EMS (CEMS) as a universal tool are introduced. An improved real-coded genetic algorithm and an enhanced mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based method have been developed to schedule the unit commitment and economic dispatch of microgrid units. In the proposed methods, network restrictions like voltages and equipment loadings and unit constraints have been considered. The adopted genetic algorithm features a highly flexible set of sub-functions, intelligent convergence behavior, as well as diversified searching approaches and penalty methods for constraint violations. Moreover, a novel method has been introduced to deal with the limitations of the MILP algorithm for handling the non-linear network topology constraints. A new aging model of a Lithium-Ion battery based on an event-driven aging behavior has been introduced. Ultimately, the developed GA-based and MILP-based optimizers have been applied to a test microgrid model under different operation policies, and the functionality of each method has been evaluated and compared together. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper considers a multi-UAV enabled wireless communication system, where multiple UAV-mounted aerial base stations are employed to serve a group of users on the ground. To achieve fair performance among users, we maximize the minimum throughput over all ground users in the downlink communication by optimizing the multiuser communication scheduling and association jointly with the UAV's trajectory and power control. The formulated problem is a mixed integer nonconvex optimization problem that is challenging to solve. As such, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm for solving it by applying the block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization techniques. Specifically, the user scheduling and association, UAV trajectory, and transmit power are alternately optimized in each iteration. In particular, for the nonconvex UAV trajectory and transmit power optimization problems, two approximate convex optimization problems are solved, respectively. We further show that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge. To speed up the algorithm convergence and achieve good throughput, a low-complexity and systematic initialization scheme is also proposed for the UAV trajectory design based on the simple circular trajectory and the circle packing scheme. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the significant throughput gains of the proposed design as compared to other benchmark schemes. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication has gained increasing interests from the industry and academia as UAV has a variety of emerging applications, such as aerial sensors, flying base stations, and mobile relays. Generally, UAVs are manipulated by remote ground control center. Thus one critical issue is that UAVs must correctly receive the control signal before following the instructions. However, the control signal quality at UAV receivers is very susceptible due to the variation of channel conditions and the effect of adjacent channel interference. To tackle these challenges, this paper investigates the issue of how to simultaneously ensure the reliability of the remote control signal for multiple UAVs. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming with the goal of maximizing the minimum signal to interference-plus-noise ratio of all UAVs by jointly scheduling the time-frequency resource blocks and optimizing the power allocation. To make the problem tractable, we perform equivalent transformations via leveraging the inherent property of the formulated problem. Next, based on the decoupled constraints on different variables, we propose a low complexity block coordinate descent-based method. Furthermore, to offer better system performance, we leverage the smooth approximation theory and develop a gradient projection-based method. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods under various parameter configurations. © 2013 IEEE.},

In particular, we consider that UAVs may differ so that each UAV can be individually designed. Besides, for the sake of collision avoidance of these multi-UAVs, an effective security flight mechanism is designed. To achieve a fair performance between GTs, this paper aims to maximize the minimum GT throughput by jointly optimizing the communication scheduling, power allocation, and UAVs' trajectories.

Aggregating thermal generators with identical characteristics (e.g., minimum/maximum power output, minimum up/down time, and cost curves) into a single unit reduces redundancy in the search space induced by both exact symmetry (permutations of generator schedules) and certain classes of mutually nondominated solutions. We study the impact of aggregation on two large-scale UC instances: one from the academic literature and the other based on real-world operator data. Our computational tests demonstrate that, when present, identical generators can negatively affect the performance of modern MILP solvers on UC formulations. Furthermore, we show that our reformation of the UC MILP through aggregation is an effective method for mitigating this source of computational difficulty. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

The batch delivery schedule is integrated with a parallel machine schedule of job orders from multi-customers. So, the objective of the problem is to simultaneously determine machine scheduling, batching and truck delivery scheduling to the corresponding customer to minimize the delivery completion time of whole the batched jobs. To solve the problem, two approaches are addressed in this article. The first approach uses a mathematical model (mixed integer programming model) to obtain the optimal solution. Since the problem is NP-hard, three kinds of genetic algorithm-based heuristics are proposed to increase solution efficiency for the second approach. The performances of the algorithms are compared using computational experiments with randomly generated examples.

The volumes of all major types of cargo, which are transported by vessels, has substantially increased in recent years. Considering a rapid growth of waterborne trade, marine container terminal operators should focus on upgrading the existing terminal infrastructure and improving operations planning. This study aims to assist marine container terminal operators with improving the seaside operations and primarily focuses on the berth scheduling problem. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model, minimizing the total weighted vessel turnaround time and the total weighted vessel late departures. A self-adaptive Evolutionary Algorithm is proposed to solve the problem, where the crossover and mutation probabilities are encoded in the chromosomes. Numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate performance of the developed solution algorithm against the alternative Evolutionary Algorithms, which rely on the deterministic parameter control, adaptive parameter control, and parameter tuning strategies, respectively. Results indicate that all the considered solution algorithms demonstrate a relatively low variability in terms of the objective function values at termination from one replication to another and can maintain the adequate population diversity. However, application of the self-adaptive parameter control strategy substantially improves the objective function values at termination without a significant impact on the computational time. © 2018 by the authors.},

According to the characteristics and the requirements of the operation of sea-rail intermodal transport, this paper puts forward a design for the transport yard which facilitates container loading and unloading. Through the establishment of a mixed integer programming model, a flexible schedule for gantry crane operation can be realized, so that, during the planned period, the amount of task overflow in loading and unloading operations and the distance covered by all gantry cranes in the yard is minimized. In addition, a genetic algorithm is designed to solve this model. Finally, a specific example of the loading and unloading of a container train at the sea-rail intermodal transport yard is selected to verify the model and the algorithm.

	abstract = {Microgrids are increasingly deployed and networked at the power distribution level in the transition toward an active distribution network (ADN) that is managed by a distribution system operator (DSO). This paper presents a decentralized economic dispatch approach for an ADN, when the DSO collaborates with microgrid central controllers (MGCCs) residing in a set of networked microgrids for optimizing the ADN's energy management. This paper first develops a comprehensive economic dispatch model in the form of mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) for ensuring the efficiency and security of the ADN's operation. The proposed model takes full advantage of advanced control entities, such as on-load tap-changing transformers, static Var compensators, and remotely-controlled switches, while facilitating the plug-and-play participation of microgrids in providing energy and auxiliary services to the ADN. Next, generalized Benders decomposition is applied to solve the proposed MISOCP problem in a decentralized and iterative manner. After receiving power exchange requests from the DSO, MGCCs iteratively provide feedback in terms of Benders cuts without revealing their private operational information in order to help the DSO find the optimal dispatch decision. Moreover, a specific set of cutting planes are derived to ensure the tightness of the second-order cone relaxation of branch flows in the solution process. Last, case studies based on the modified IEEE 33-bus distribution system are conducted for evaluating the computational performance of the proposed approach. Numerical results have validated that the proposed approach has favorable efficiency, accuracy, and robustness, with great potential in the energy management of an ADN. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of minimizing the total daily energy cost in a smart residential building composed of multiple smart homes with the aim of reducing the cost of energy bills and the greenhouse gas emissions under different system constraints and user preferences. As the household appliances contribute significantly to the energy consumption of the smart houses, it is possible to decrease electricity cost in buildings by scheduling the operation of domestic appliances. In this paper, we propose an optimization model for jointly minimizing electricity costs and CO2 emissions by considering consumer preferences in smart buildings that are equipped with distributed energy resources (DERs). Both controllable and uncontrollable tasks and DER operations are scheduled according to the real-time price of electricity and a peak demand charge to reduce the peak demand on the grid. We formulate the daily energy consumption scheduling problem in multiple smart homes from economic and environmental perspectives and exploit a mixed integer linear programming technique to solve it. We validated the proposed approach through extensive experimental analysis. The results of the experiment show that the proposed approach can decrease both CO2 emissions and the daily energy cost. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

In particular, automotive embedded systems are highly complex in nature, and their functionality is realized by a set of periodic tasks. These tasks may have hard real-time requirements and communicate over an interconnect. The problemis to efficiently co-schedule task execution on cores and message transmission on the interconnect so that timing constraints are satisfied. Contemporary works typically deal with zero-jitter scheduling, which results in lower resource utilization, but has lower memory requirements. This article focuses on jitter-constrained scheduling that puts constraints on the tasks jitter, increasing schedulability over zero-jitter scheduling. The contributions of this article are: 1) Integer Linear Programming and Satisfiability Modulo Theory model exploiting problem-specific information to reduce the formulations complexity to schedule small applications. 2) A heuristic approach, employing three levels of scheduling scaling to real-world use-cases with 10,000 tasks and messages. 3) An experimental evaluation of the proposed approaches on a case-study and on synthetic data sets showing the efficiency of both zero-jitter and jitter-constrained scheduling. It shows that up to 28 percent higher resource utilization can be achieved by having up to 10 times longer computation time with relaxed jitter requirements. © 2017 IEEE.},

The topics of optimal offering strategy and self-scheduling of thermal units have been extensively addressed in the literature. The feasible operating region of such units can be modeled using a mixed-integer linear programming approach, and the trading problem as a linear programming problem. However, the existing models mostly assume a uniform pricing scheme in all market stages, while several European balancing markets (e.g., in Germany and Italy) are settled under a pay-as-bid pricing scheme. The existing tools for solving the trading problem in pay-as-bid electricity markets rely on nonlinear optimization models, which, combined with the unit commitment constraints, result in a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. In contrast, we provide a linear formulation for that trading problem. Then, we extend the proposed approach by formulating a two-stage stochastic problem for optimal offering in a two-settlement electricity market with a pay-as-bid pricing scheme at the balancing stage. The resulting model is mixed-integer and linear. The proposed model is tested on a realistic case study against a sequential offering approach, showing the capability of increasing profits in expectation. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the hot rolling mill, a cold slab is reheated in reheating furnace and then rolled into thin coils through hot rolling process. Traditional research on hot rolling mill generally takes the two processes as two separate single-objective scheduling problems, though they are closely connected and their optimization objectives are conflicting with each other. In this paper, the integrated scheduling of the reheating furnace and hot rolling is investigated in the view of multiobjective optimization. A mixed-integer programming model with two objectives is formulated for this problem, and a multiobjective differential evolution (MODE) algorithm is developed to solve this model. To make it easy for algorithm design, a hot rolling schedule (i.e., a sequence of slabs) is used to represent a solution and for a given solution, a heuristic with consideration of energy consumption minimization is presented to obtain the schedule of reheating furnace. To achieve the balance of exploration and exploitation, a novel mutation operator with adaptive leader selection, a crossover operator with feasibility consideration, and a guided multiobjective local search are designed. Computational results based on simulated data illustrate that the integrated scheduling is superior to the traditional two-phase scheduling method used in practice and literature. Further results illustrate that the proposed MODE algorithm is effective and superior to some other multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. Copyright © 2018 Kun Li and Huixin Tian.},

This paper considers the train scheduling with short turning strategy for an urban rail transit line with multiple depots. In addition, the utilization of trains is also taken into consideration. First, we develop a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for the train scheduling, where short turning train services and full-length train services are optimized based on the predefined headway obtained by the passenger demand analysis. The MINLP model is then transformed into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model according to several transformation properties. The resulting MILP problem can be solved efficiently by existing solvers, e.g., CPLEX. Two case studies with different scales are constructed to assess the performance of train schedules with the short turning strategy based on the data of Beijing Subway line 4. The simulation results show that the reduction of the utilization of trains is about 20.69%. © 2018 Miao Zhang et al.},

	abstract = {Energy optimization for periodic applications running on safety/time-critical time-triggered multiprocessor systems has been studied recently. An interesting feature of the applications on the systems is that some tasks are strictly periodic while others are non-strictly periodic, i.e., the start time interval between any two successive instances of the same task is not fixed as long as task deadlines can be met. Energy-efficient scheduling of such applications on the systems has, however, been rarely investigated. In this paper, we focus on the problem of static scheduling multiple periodic applications consisting of both strictly and non-strictly periodic tasks on safety/time-critical time-triggered multiprocessor systems for energy minimization. The challenge of the problem is that both strictly and non-strictly periodic tasks must be intelligently addressed in scheduling to optimize energy consumption. We introduce a new practical task model to characterize the unique feature of specific tasks, and formulate the energy-efficient scheduling problem based on the model. Then, an improved Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) method is proposed to obtain the optimal scheduling solution by considering strict and non-strict periodicity of the specific tasks. To decrease the high complexity of MILP, we also develop a heuristic algorithm to efficiently find a high-quality solution in reasonable time. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate the proposed MILP and heuristic methods can on average achieve about 14.21% and 13.76% energy-savings respectively compared with existing work. © 2018 by the authors.

	abstract = {Ancillary services are critical to maintaining the safe and stable operation of power systems that contain a high penetration level of renewable energy resources. As a high-quality regulation resource, the regional integrated energy system (RIES) with energy storage system (ESS) can effectively adjust the non-negligible frequency offset caused by the renewable energy integration into the power system, and help solve the problem of power system frequency stability. In this paper, the optimization model aiming at regional integrated energy system as a participant in the regulation market based on pay-for-performance is established. Meanwhile YALMIP + CPLEX is used to simulate and analyze the total operating cost under different dispatch modes. This paper uses the actual operation model of the PJM regulation market to guide the optimal allocation of regulation resource in the regional integrated energy system, and provides a balance between the power trading revenue and regulation market revenue in order to achieve the maximum profit. © 2018 by the authors.

Firstly, aiming at the radiant floor heating/cooling system widely utilized in residential buildings, the mathematical relationship between the operative temperature and heating/cooling demand is established based on the equivalent thermodynamic parameters (ETP) model, by which the thermal storage capacity is analyzed. Secondly, the radiant floor heating/cooling system is treated as virtual energy storage system (VESS), and an optimization model based on mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) for r-microgrid scheduling is established which takes thermal comfort level and economy as the optimization objectives.

	abstract = {Established approaches to data aggregation in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) do not cover the variety of new use cases developing with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT). In particular, the current push toward fog computing, in which control, computation, and storage are moved to nodes close to the network edge, induces a need to collect data at multiple sinks, rather than the single sink typically considered in WSN aggregation algorithms. Moreover, for machine-to-machine communication scenarios, actuators subscribing to sensor measurements may also be present, in which case data should be not only aggregated and processed in-network but also disseminated to actuator nodes. In this paper, we present mixed-integer programming formulations and algorithms for the problem of energy-optimal routing and multiple-sink aggregation, as well as joint aggregation and dissemination, of sensor measurement data in IoT edge networks. We consider optimization of the network for both minimal total energy usage, and min-max per-node energy usage. We also provide a formulation and algorithm for throughput-optimal scheduling of transmissions under the physical interference model in the pure aggregation case. We have conducted a numerical study to compare the energy required for the two use cases, as well as the time to solve them, in generated network scenarios with varying topologies and between 10 and 40 nodes. Although aggregation only accounts for less than 15% of total energy usage in all cases tested, it provides substantial energy savings. Our results show more than 13 times greater energy usage for 40-node networks using direct, shortest-path flows from sensors to actuators, compared with our aggregation and dissemination solutions. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The recently emerging trend of self-driving vehicles and information sharing technologies, made available by private technology vendors, starts creating a revolutionary paradigm shift in the coming years for traveler mobility applications. By considering a deterministic traveler decision making framework at the household level in congested transportation networks, this paper aims to address the challenges of how to optimally schedule individuals’ daily travel patterns under the complex activity constraints and interactions. We reformulate two special cases of household activity pattern problem (HAPP) through a high-dimensional network construct, and offer a systematic comparison with the classical mathematical programming models proposed by Recker (1995). Furthermore, we consider the tight road capacity constraint as another special case of HAPP to model complex interactions between multiple household activity scheduling decisions, and this attempt offers another household-based framework for linking activity-based model (ABM) and dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) tools. Through embedding temporal and spatial relations among household members, vehicles and mandatory/optional activities in an integrated space-time-state network, we develop two 0–1 integer linear programming models that can seamlessly incorporate constraints for a number of key decisions related to vehicle selection, activity performing and ridesharing patterns under congested networks. The well-structured network models can be directly solved by standard optimization solvers, and further converted to a set of time-dependent state-dependent least cost path-finding problems through Lagrangian relaxation, which permit the use of computationally efficient algorithms on large-scale high-fidelity transportation networks. © 2017},

	abstract = {A railway signaling system is a complex and interdependent system which should ensure the safe operation of trains. We introduce and address a mixed integer optimisation model for the preventive signal maintenance crew scheduling problem in the Danish railway system. The problem contains many practical constraints, such as temporal dependencies between crew schedules, the splitting of tasks across multiple days, crew competency requirements and several other managerial constraints. We propose a novel hybrid framework using Constraint Programming to generate initial feasible solutions to feed as ‘warm start’ solutions to a Mixed Integer Programming solver for further improvement. We apply this hybrid framework to a section of the Danish rail network and benchmark our results against both direct application of a Mixed Integer Programming solver and modelling the problem as a Constraint Optimisation Problem. Whereas the current practice of using a general purpose Mixed Integer Programming solver is only able to solve instances over a two-week planning horizon, the hybrid framework generates good results for problem instances over an eight-week period. In addition, the use of a Mixed Integer Programming solver to improve the initial solutions generated by Constraint Programming is shown to be significantly superior to addressing the problem as a Constraint Optimisation Problem. © 2017 The Authors},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the integrated scheduling of production and distribution operations in a multifactory supply chain with make-to-order production system. For the production side of the supply chain, we considered distributed parallel-established factories with identical parallel machines available at each factory. We assumed that the factories could produce all customers’ orders with different production rates and costs. For the distribution side of the supply chain, we considered a limited number of homogeneous vehicles that immediately distribute the finalized orders to the customers. Then, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is developed to determine the detailed scheduling of production and distribution that minimizes the total costs of the supply chain including production, distribution, and late delivery costs. To solve the real-world scale problems, we developed a new whale optimization algorithm (WOA). Moreover, we conducted computational experiments by generating several test problems to evaluate the proposed algorithm. Statistical analysis showed that the proposed algorithm has better performance than traditional WOA for different scales of the problem. Moreover, it confirms the capability of the improved whale optimization algorithm (IWOA) to solve the medium-scale instances; however, the results indicate the better performance of genetic algorithm (GA) for the large-scale instances.

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a promising method that can assist BSs to offload the data traffic, due to its high mobility and flexibility. In this correspondence, we focus on the UAV trajectory at the edges of three adjacent cells to offload traffic for BSs. In the proposed scheme, the sum rate of UAV-served edge users is maximized subject to the rate requirements for all the users, by optimizing the UAV trajectory in each flying cycle. The optimization is a mixed-integer nonconvex problem, which is difficult to solve. Thus, it is transformed into two convex problems, and an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve it by optimizing the UAV trajectory and edge user scheduling alternately.

This work focuses on HEN applications in crude oil preheat trains located in refineries. Previous approaches have focused on using mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) methods involving binary decision variables describing when and which unit to clean in a multi-period formulation. This work is based on the discovery that the HEN cleaning scheduling problem is in actuality a multistage optimal control problem (OCP), and further that cleaning actions are the controls which appear linearly in the system equations. The key feature is that these problems exhibit bang-bang behaviour, obviating the need for combinatorial optimisation methods. Several case studies are considered; ranging from a single unit up to 25 units. Results show that the feasible path approach adopted is stable and efficient in comparison to classical methods which sometimes suffer from failure in convergence. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Train timetabling is crucial for passenger railway operation. Demand-oriented train timetable optimization by minimizing travel time plays an important role in both theory and practice. Most of the current researches of demand-oriented timetable models assume an idealized situation in which the service order is fixed and in which zero overtaking exists between trains. In order to extend the literature, this paper discusses the combinatorial effect of service order and overtaking by developing four mixed-integer quadratic programming timetabling models with different service order as well as overtaking conditions. With the objective of minimizing passengers' waiting time and in-vehicle time, the models take five aspects as constraints, namely dwell time, running time, safety interval, overtaking, and capacity. All four models are solved by ILOG CPLEX; and the results, which are based on Shanghai-Hangzhou intercity high-speed rail data, show that either allowing overtaking or changing service order can effectively optimize the quality of timetable with respect to reducing the total passengers' travel time. Although optimizing train overtaking and service order simultaneously can optimize the timetable more significantly, compared to overtaking, allowing the change of service order can help passengers save total travel time without extending the train travel time. Moreover, considering the computation effort, satisfying both of the conditions in the meantime, when optimizing timetable has not got a good cost benefit. © 2018 Dewei Li et al.},

Specifically, in the first stage, we obtain an optimal solution of the SDSA-trains under each scenario, which leads to the minimum total travel time. In the second stage, a robust SDSA-train schedule is generated based on the optimal solutions of the first stage. The key is that we consider two operation modes to solve the conflict between the SDSA-trains and the maintenances. Some state variables are used to deal with train operation mode selection.

	abstract = {We consider scheduling problems with the new concept of flexible release dates under an online optimization framework. A flexible release date is one where the traditional release date of a specific operation can be moved earlier in time, specifically to the completion time of an associated supplementary operation. In this context, we examine two classes of parallel identical machines: those that perform supplementary operations to alter release dates and those that perform installation operations to change the network characteristics. We further consider multi-function machines that can perform both supplementary and installation operations. The release date of an operation is often determined by events outside the knowledge of the decision-maker. Therefore, we consider scheduling problems in an online setting to model the lack of- and evolution of information about the release dates of tasks. Motivated by infrastructure restoration after an extreme event, we consider flexible release dates for an integrated network design and scheduling problem that seeks to improve the performance of a network over time by selecting and scheduling operations that will change the network characteristics. To solve these problems, we propose heuristic dispatching rules whose solutions are benchmarked against the solutions of a mixed integer programming formulation. Using a realistic infrastructure network, we perform computational tests; the results of these tests demonstrate the ability of the dispatching rule to find high-quality solutions in real time and quickly adapt to the arrival of new information. From the analysis of these results, we deduce policy insights regarding the role of flexible release dates and the machine fleet configuration. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of wireless sensor network (WSN) lifetime maximization, under limited available energy constraint. The investigations have shown that the valid amount of energy was not used by the existing disjoint set covers (DSC) based scheduling method for WSNs lifetime maximization, because of the DSC constraints. Instead, we suggest in this paper to schedule non-disjoint sets covers (NDSC) for maximizing WSNs lifetime. Thus, we have formulated this problem, using the integer linear programming (ILP) mathematical model, then we developed an approach based on genetic algorithm GA to find the maximal lifespan. As main contributions, we investigated and designed a new method using the NDSC instead of the DSC. This approach removes the latter's constraint and gives the opportunity to a sensor to participate in more than one cover, and thereby improves significantly the WSNs’ lifetime. We proposed an exact method and a genetic algorithms (GA) for the NDSC efficient scheduling for the WSN lifetime maximization. The exact method lies on the integer linear programming (ILP). For the GA based heuristics, we used a specific arrangement of chromosomes combining several crossover and mutation strategies for encoding the solutions. We provided experimental results for different instances involving sensors with non-identical amount of initial energy and power consumption. In addition, we provided comparative analysis results between the solutions obtained by our both methods and the existing methods based on DSC. The comparisons of the run times and the solutions’ quality revealed the dominance of the solutions yielded by our methods based on the NDSC compared to those based on the DSC. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The inevitable high dimensionality and nonlinearity of first-principles dynamic process models makes incorporating them in scheduling calculations challenging. In this work, we describe a general framework for deriving data-driven surrogate models of the closed-loop process dynamics. Focusing on Hammerstein–Wiener and finite step response (FSR) model forms, we show that these models can be (exactly) linearized and embedded in production scheduling calculations. The resulting scheduling problems are mixed-integer linear programs with a special structure, which we exploit in a novel and efficient solution strategy. A polymerization reactor case study is utilized to demonstrate the merits of this method. Our framework compares favorably to existing approaches that embed dynamics in scheduling calculations, showing considerable reductions in computational effort. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Managing rolling stock with no passengers aboard is a critical component of railway operations. One aspect of managing rolling stock is to park the rolling stock on a given set of tracks at the end of a day or service. Depending on the parking assignment, shunting may be required in order for a parked train to depart or for an incoming train to park. Given a collection of tracks ℳ and a collection of trains T with a fixed arrival-departure timetable, the train assignment problem (TAP) is to determine the maximum number of trains from T that can be parked on ℳ according to the timetable and without the use of shunting. Hence, efficiently solving the TAP allows to quickly compute feasible parking schedules that do not require further shunting adjustments. In this paper, we show that the TAP is NP-hard and present two integer programming models for solving the TAP. We compare both models on a theoretical level. Moreover, to our knowledge, we consider the first approach that integrates track lengths along with the three most common types of parking tracks FIFO, LIFO and FREE tracks in a common model. Furthermore, to optimize against uncertainty in the arrival times of the trains we extend our models by stochastic and robust modeling techniques. We conclude by giving computational results for both models, observing that they perform well on real timetables. © 2017},

We identify relevant scientific issues that need to be addressed in this topic at strategical, tactical and operational levels. Then we focus on the Freight-Rail-Transport-Scheduling Problem which provides valuable information to and constitutes a basis for other related problems. This problem is first formulated into a MIP. We prove its NP-hardness and hence propose a heuristic based on dispatching rules and a single-train-based decomposition heuristic. The performances of these heuristics are evaluated via employing a discrete-event simulation approach, which also provides a general framework which supports decision-makers in modelling and evaluating the dynamics of such a system for various alternative solutions under various scenarios. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Recently, increasing penetration of renewable energy generation has created challenges for power system operators to perform efficient power generation daily scheduling, due to the intermittent nature of the renewable generation and discrete decisions of each generation unit. Among all aspects to be considered, a unit commitment polytope is fundamental and embedded in the models at different stages of power system planning and operations. In this article, we focus on deriving polynomial-time algorithms for the unit commitment problems with a general convex cost function and piecewise linear cost function, respectively. We refine an O(T3) time, where T represents the number of time periods, algorithm for the deterministic single-generator unit commitment problem with a general convex cost function and accordingly develop an extended formulation in a higher-dimensional space that can provide an integral solution, in which the physical meanings of the decision variables are described. This means the original problem can be solved as a convex program instead of a mixed-integer convex program. Furthermore, for the case in which the cost function is piecewise linear, by exploring the optimality conditions, we derive more efficient algorithms for both deterministic (i.e., O(T) time) and stochastic (i.e., O(N) time, where N represents the number of nodes in the stochastic scenario tree) single-generator unit commitment problems. We also develop the corresponding extended formulations for both deterministic and stochastic single-generator unit commitment problems that solve the original mixed-integer linear programs as linear programs. Similarly, physical meanings of the decision variables are explored to show the insights of the new modeling approach. Copyright © 2018 “IISE”.},

	abstract = {For the train timetabling problem (TTP) in a metro system, the operator-oriented and passenger-oriented objectives are both important but partly conflicting. This paper aims to minimize both objectives by considering frequency (in the line planning stage) and train cost (in the vehicle scheduling stage). Time-varying passenger demand and train capacity are considered in a nonsmooth, nonconvex programming model, which is transformed into a mixed integer programming model with a discrete time-space graph (DTSG). A novel dwell time determining process considering congestion at stations is proposed, which turns the dwell times into dependent variables. In the solution approach, we decompose the TTP into a subproblem for optimizing segment travel times (OST) and a subproblem for optimizing departure headways from the shunting yard (OH). Branch-and-bound and frequency determining algorithms are designed to solve OST. A novel rolling optimization algorithm is designed to solve OH. The numerical experiments include case studies on a short metro line and Beijing Metro Line 4, as well as sensitivity analyses. The results demonstrate the predictive ability of the model, verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach, and provide practical insights for different scenarios, which can be used for decision-making support in daily operations. © 2018 Keping Li et al.},

	abstract = {Regret is defined as the deviation of objective value from the perfect information solution, and serves as an important evaluation metric for decision-making under uncertainty. This paper proposes a novel framework that effectively incorporates the minimax regret criterion into two-stage adaptive robust optimization (ARO). In addition to the conventional robustness criterion, this ARO framework also simultaneously optimizes the worst-case regret to push the performance of the resulting solution towards the utopia one under perfect information. By using a data-driven uncertainty set, we formulate a multiobjective ARO problem that generates a set of Pareto-optimal solutions to reveal the systematic trade-offs between the conventional robustness and minimax regret criteria. The resulting multi-level mixed-integer programming problem cannot be solved directly by any off-the-shelf optimization solvers, so we further propose tailored column-and-constraint generation algorithms to address the computational challenge. Two applications on process network planning and batch process scheduling are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework and the efficiency of the proposed solution algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Binary variables regarding line status (active or inactive) are introduced for this purpose. These variables allow discrete decisions on the connectivity of buses, reducing the angle coupling between buses, with several advantages. Three examples are solved. The results indicate that this method can obtain feasible solutions with CPU times of 2.5 s (for a 6-bus system) and 500 s (for the IEEE 118-bus system), and they reached cost savings up to 4.9% of the total generating cost for one day of programming horizon, in comparison with classical models.

	abstract = {This work aims to reduce the global resource consumption in an industrial evaporation network by better tasks management and coordination. The network works in continuous, processing some products in several evaporation plants, so optimal load allocation and product-plant assignment problems appear. The plants have different features (capacity, equipment, etc.) and their performance is affected by fouling inside the heat exchangers and external factors. Hereby, the optimizer has to decide when maintenance operations have to be triggered. Therefore, a mixed production/maintenance scheduling problem arises. The plant behavior is approximated by surrogate linear models obtained experimentally, allowing thus the use of mixed-integer linear optimization routines to obtain solutions in acceptable time. Furthermore, uncertainty in the weather forecast and in the production plan is also considered via a two-stage stochastic programming approach. Finally, a trade-off analysis between other objectives of interest is given to support the decision maker. © 2017 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes a flexible job shop scheduling problem with operators and is motivated by a real-life case study of the aeronautical industry, where each process can be performed on alternative machines (shared by multiple products) and requires not only machines but also some operators to execute the process. One goal of this scheduling is to minimize the number of operators and airframes that are needed in the assembly line. Minimizing the number of airframes in the assembly line, which is particularly important due to the cost of each airframe, is generally ignored in production planning models that are used in prior studies. Moreover, the output of the program refers to a set of schedules that includes different combinations of number of operators and intermediate stock, to enable a better decision making. A mixed integer linear programming model is presented to solve this problem. Experimentation was conducted using real-life examples from the aeronautical industry. The solutions that are presented in this paper outperformed current industrial methods in both quality and calculation time. To the best of our knowledge, this variant has not been addressed in prior studies either in scheduling or in aeronautics contexts. However, minimizing the number of operators and intermediate stock could have significant implications for numerous labor intensive industries, contributing to enhanced and more agile decision making processes. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Planning of caving operations poses complexities in different areas such as safety, ground control and production scheduling. Draw control is fundamental to the success of block-cave operation. Although some complex theories and mathematical draw control systems have been applied in block-cave mines, most of them did not have an exact production rate curve (PRC) to manage draw rates of drawpoints and are too complex to provide a solution for real block-caving mines. This paper presents a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to optimise the extraction sequence of drawpoints over multiple time horizons of block-cave mines with respect to the draw control systems. Four draw rate strategies are formulated to guarantee practical solutions. Furthermore, dilution and caving are improved indirectly, because the method considers the draw rate strategy. Application and comparison of the four models for production scheduling based on draw control systems are presented using 298 drawpoints over 15 periods.

	abstract = {Recent critical embedded systems become more and more complex and usually react to their environment that requires to amend their behaviors by applying run-time reconfiguration scenarios. A system is defined in this paper as a set of networked devices, where each of which has its own operating system, a processor to execute related periodic software tasks, and a local battery. A reconfiguration is any operation allowing the addition-removal-update of tasks to adapt the device and the whole system to its environment. It may be a reaction to a fault or even optimization of the system functional behavior. Nevertheless, such scenario can cause the violation of real-time or energy constraints, which is considered as a critical run-time problem. We propose a multi-agent adaptive architecture to handle dynamic reconfigurations and ensure the correct execution of the concurrent real-time distributed tasks under energy constraints. The proposed architecture integrates a centralized scheduler agent (ScA) which is the common decision making element for the scheduling problem. It is able to carry out the required run-time solutions based on operation research techniques and mathematical tools for the system's feasibility. This architecture assigns also a reconfiguration agent (RAp) to each device $p$ to control and handle the local reconfiguration scenarios under the instructions of ScA. A token-based protocol is defined in this case for the coordination between the different distributed agents in order to guarantee the whole system's feasibility under energy constraints. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In scheduling theory and practise for parallel computing, representing a program as a task graph with communication delays is a popular model, due to its general nature, its expressiveness and relative simplicity. Unfortunately, scheduling such a task graph on a set of processors in such a way that it achieves its shortest possible execution time (P|pred, cij|Cmax in α|β|γ notation) is a strong NP-hard optimization problem without any known guaranteed approximation algorithm. Hence, many heuristics have been researched and are used in practise. However, in many situations it is necessary to obtain optimal schedules, for example, in the case of time-critical systems or for the evaluation of heuristics. Recent years have seen some advances in optimal algorithms for this scheduling problem, based on smart exhaustive state-space search or MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) formulations. This paper proposes a novel approach based on SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theory). We propose an elegant SMT formulation of the scheduling problem that only needs one decision variable and is very compact and comprehensible in comparison to the state-of-the-art MILP formulations. This novel optimal scheduling approach is extensively evaluated in experiments with more than a thousand task graphs. We perform experimental comparison with the best known MILP formulations, with attempts to further improve them, and deeply analyse the behaviour of the different approaches with respect to size, structure, number of processors, etc. Our proposed SMT-based approach in general outperforms the MILP-formulations and still possesses great potential for further optimization, from which MILP formulations have benefited in the past. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Mobile power sources (MPSs), including electric vehicle fleets, truck-mounted mobile energy storage systems, and mobile emergency generators, have great potential to enhance distribution system (DS) resilience against extreme weather events. However, their dispatch is not well investigated. This paper implements resilient routing and scheduling of MPSs via a two-stage framework. In the first stage, i.e., before the event, MPSs are pre-positioned in the DS to enable rapid pre-restoration, in order to enhance survivability of the electricity supply to critical loads. DS network is also proactively reconfigured into a less impacted or stressed state. A two-stage robust optimization model is constructed and solved by the column-and-constraint generation algorithm to derive first-stage decisions. In the second stage, i.e., after the event, MPSs are dynamically dispatched in the DS to coordinate with conventional restoration efforts, so as to enhance system recovery. A novel mixed-integer programming model that resolves different timescales of MPS dispatch and DS operation, coupling of road and power networks, etc., is formulated to optimize dynamic dispatch of MPSs. Case studies conducted on IEEE 33-node and 123-node test systems demonstrate the proposed method’s effectiveness in routing and scheduling MPSs for DS resilience enhancement. © 2018 IEEE.},

The statistical results demonstrate that the RSA, SA, and ABC provide much better solutions than the MILP model solved using Gurobi solver for small problems within a reasonable execution time. The RSA offers significant improvements over the SA and ABC algorithms when applied to large problems. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RSA heuristic significantly decreases system testing makespan in a computer manufacturing plant at Taiwan. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In case of railway disruptions, traffic controllers are responsible for dealing with disrupted traffic and reduce the negative impact for the rest of the network. In case of a complete blockage when no train can use an entire track, a common practice is to short-turn trains. Trains approaching the blockage cannot proceed according to their original plans and have to short-turn at a station close to the disruption on both sides. This paper presents a Mixed Integer Linear Program that computes the optimal station and times for short-turning the affected train services during the three phases of a disruption. The proposed solution approach takes into account the interaction of the traffic between both sides of the blockage before and after the disruption. The model is applied to a busy corridor of the Dutch railway network. The computation time meets the real-time solution requirement. The case study gives insight into the importance of the disruption period in computing the optimal solution. It is concluded that different optimal short-turning solutions may exist depending on the start time of the disruption and the disruption length. For periodic timetables, the optimal short-turning choices repeat due to the periodicity of the timetable. In addition, it is observed that a minor extension of the disruption length may result in less delay propagation at the cost of more cancellations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Wireless communications with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a promising technology offering potential high mobility and low cost. This paper studies a UAV-enabled communication system, in which a fixed-wing UAV is deployed to collect information from a group of distributed ground terminals (GTs). Considering the requirements for quality of service (QoS) (i.e., the throughput of each GT is above a given threshold) and GT scheduling, we maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the UAV in bits/Joule by optimizing the UAV's flight trajectory. In this paper, a mixed integer nonconvex optimization problem is formulated. As that is difficult to solve, we divide the formulated problem into two subproblems and apply standard linear programming (LP) and successive convex optimization techniques. We further propose an efficient iterative algorithm that jointly optimizes GT scheduling and the UAV's trajectory. Moreover, we set two special cases as benchmarks to measure the performance of the proposed design. The numerical results show that our proposed design achieves much better performance than the other two benchmark designs. © 2018 Yu Xu et al.},

	abstract = {The study proposes a stochastic optimisation approach based on discrete scenarios and the minimax criterion to deal with demand uncertainty in the two-stage unit commitment problem. To avoid making an over-conservative decision, the approach is designed to assign a probability-based weight to each demand scenario and provide a unit commitment schedule that minimises the maximum possible-weighted generation cost. Unit commitment is determined in the first stage and the economic dispatch under the scenario that corresponds to the maximum possible-weighted generation cost is determined in the second stage. The problem is formulated as a type of min-max-min mixed integer programming model. By introducing an auxiliary variable, the model is further transformed into a minimisation problem. A Benders decomposition algorithm is developed to solve the problem. The Benders master problem determines the unit commitment decision, while the Benders subproblem determines the dispatch decision. Multiple Benders feasibility cuts are constructed when the Benders subproblem is infeasible. Valid inequalities are derived to improve the lower bound provided by the Benders master problem. Numerical results show the performance of the algorithm. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.},

	abstract = {Full-duplex wireless communication has been recognized as an effective technique to improve the system throughput. This paper designs a CSMA-based utility-optimal scheduling scheme to fully explore the performance improvement brought by AP's full-duplex capability. In particular, to keep the backwards compatibility of the legacy users, we allow users to compete to access the channel using the CSMA protocol in their uplink transmissions while let the AP select its downlink user to communicate with for completing the full-duplex transmission upon each uplink access. Moreover, to achieve the optimal system utility, we then formulate an optimization problem of maximizing the downlink aggregate utility subject to the uplink users' data rate constraints. The formulated problem falls into a mixed integer nonlinear programming form, which is generally NP-hard to solve. To make the problem tractable, we divide it into user pairing and access-intensity adjustment subproblems. More specifically, we devise a user pairing criterion based on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio to reduce the uplink-downlink interference, and adopt the Hungarian algorithm to find the best matching between uplink and downlink users. After that, we adjust the access-intensity of users (i.e., the ratio of the mean packet transmission time to the mean backoff time) to maximize the downlink aggregate utility based on the geometric programming. Simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of our scheduling design and demonstrate the downlink aggregate utility improvement compared to other scheduling schemes in full-duplex WLANs. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We study a setting where Electric Vehicles (EVs) can be hired to drive from pick-up to drop-off points in a Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) scheme. The goal of the system is, either to maximize the number of customers that are serviced, or the total EV utilization. To do so, we characterise the optimisation problem as a max-flow problem in order to determine the set of feasible trips given the available EVs at each location. We then model and solve the EV-to-trip scheduling problem offline and optimally using Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) techniques and show that the solution scales up to medium sized problems. Given this, we develop two non-optimal algorithms, namely an incremental-MIP algorithm for medium to large problems and a greedy heuristic algorithm for very large problems. Moreover, we develop a tabu search-based local search technique to further improve upon and compare against the solution of the non-optimal algorithms. We study the performance of these algorithms in settings where either battery swap or battery charge at each station is used to cope with the EVs' limited driving range. Moreover, in settings where EVs need to be scheduled online, we propose a novel algorithm that accounts for the uncertainty in future trip requests. All algorithms are empirically evaluated using real-world data of locations of shared vehicle pick-up and drop-off stations. In our experiments, we observe that when all EVs carry the same battery which is large enough for the longest trips, the greedy algorithm with battery swap with the max-flow solution as a pre-processing step, provides the optimal solution. At the same time, the greedy algorithm with battery charge is close to the optimal (97% on average) and is further improved when local search is used. When some EVs do not have a large enough battery to execute some of the longest trips, the incremental-MIP generates solutions slightly better than the greedy, while the optimal algorithm is the best but scales up to medium sized problems only. Moreover, the online algorithm is shown to be on average at least 90% of the optimal. Finally, the greedy algorithm scales to 10-times more tasks than the incremental-MIP and 1000-times more than the static MIP in reasonable time. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The short-term hydro generation scheduling (STHGS) decomposed into unit commitment (UC) and economic load dispatch (ELD) subproblems is complicated problem with integer optimization, which has characteristics of high dimension, nonlinear and complex hydraulic and electrical constraints. In this study, the improved binary-real coded shuffled frog leaping algorithm (IBR-SFLA) is proposed to effectively solve UC and ELD subproblems, respectively. For IB-SFLA, the new grouping strategy is applied to overcome the grouping shortage of SFLA, and modified search strategies for each type of frog subpopulation based on normal cloud model (NCM) and chaotic theory are introduced to enhance search performance. The initialization strategy with chaos theory and adaptive frog activation mechanism are presented to strengthen performance of IR-SFLA on ELD subproblem. Furthermore, to solve ELD subproblem, the optimal economic operation table is formed using IR-SFLA and invoked from database. Moreover, reserve capacity supplement and repair, and minimum on and off time repairing strategies are applied to handle complex constraints in STHGS. Finally, the coupled external and internal model corresponding to UC and ELD subproblems is established and applied to solve STHGS problem in Three Gorges hydropower station. Simulation results obtained from IBR-SFLA are better than other compared algorithms with less water consumption. In conclusion, to solve STHGS optimization problem, the proposed IBR-SFLA presents outstanding performance on solution precision and convergence speed compared to traditional SFLA effectively and outperforms the rivals to get higher precision solution with improving the utilization rate of waterpower resources. © 2018 Zhe Yang et al.},

This work presents a coordinated platooning model with multiple speed options that integrates scheduling, routing, speed selection, and platoon formation/dissolution in a mixed-integer linear program that minimizes the total fuel consumed by a set of vehicles while traveling between their respective origins and destinations. The performance of this model is numerically tested on a grid network and the Chicago-area highway network. We find that the fuel-savings factor of a multivehicle system significantly depends on the time each vehicle is allowed to stay in the network; this time affects vehicles’ available speed choices, possible routes, and the amount of time for coordinating platoon formation. For problem instances with a large number of vehicles, we propose and test a heuristic decomposed approach that applies a clustering algorithm to partition the set of vehicles and then routes each group separately. When the set of vehicles is large and the available computational time is small, the decomposed approach finds significantly better solutions than does the full model. © 2018},

	abstract = {The integration of hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) in alternating current (AC) electrified railway systems is attracting widespread interest. However, little attention has been paid to the interaction of optimal size and daily dispatch of HESS within the entire project period. Therefore, a novel bi-level model of railway traction substation energy management (RTSEM) system is developed, which includes a slave level of diurnal HESS dispatch and a master level of HESS sizing. The slave level is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model by coordinating HESS, traction load, regenerative braking energy and renewable energy. As for the master level model, comprehensive cost study within the project period is conducted, with batteries degradation and replacement cost taken into account. Grey wolf optimization technique with embedded CPLEX solver is utilized to solve this RTSEM problem. The proposed model is tested with a real high-speed railway line case in China. The simulation results of several cases with different system elements are presented, and the sensitivity analyses of several parameters are also performed. The obtained results reveal that it shows significant economic-saving potentials with the integration of HESS and renewable energy. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

	abstract = {Optimal design and operation of multi-energy systems involving seasonal energy storage are often hindered by the complexity of the optimization problem. Indeed, the description of seasonal cycles requires a year-long time horizon, while the system operation calls for hourly resolution; this turns into a large number of decision variables, including binary variables, when large systems are analyzed. This work presents novel mixed integer linear program methodologies that allow considering a year time horizon with hour resolution while significantly reducing the complexity of the optimization problem. First, the validity of the proposed techniques is tested by considering a simple system that can be solved in a reasonable computational time without resorting to design days. Findings show that the results of the proposed approaches are in good agreement with the full-scale optimization, thus allowing to correctly size the energy storage and to operate the system with a long-term policy, while significantly simplifying the optimization problem. Furthermore, the developed methodology is adopted to design a multi-energy system based on a neighborhood in Zurich, Switzerland, which is optimized in terms of total annual costs and carbon dioxide emissions. Finally the system behavior is revealed by performing a sensitivity analysis on different features of the energy system and by looking at the topology of the energy hub along the Pareto sets. © 2017 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Due to the complex configuration and control framework, the conventional microgrid is not cost-effective for engineering applications with small or medium capacity. A stand-alone modular microgrid with separated AC bus and decentralized control strategy is proposed in this paper. Each module is a self-powered system, which consists of wind and solar power, a storage battery, load and three-port converter. The modules are interconnected by three-port converters to form the microgrid. Characteristics, operation principle, control of the modular microgrid and the three-port converter are analyzed in detail. Distributed storage batteries enable power exchanges among modules to enhance economic returns. Economic dispatch of the stand-alone modular microgrid is a mixed-integer programming problem. A day-ahead operation optimization model including fuel cost, battery operation cost, and power transmission cost is established. Because there are so many constraints, it is difficult to produce a feasible solution and even more difficult to have an improved solution. An improved simplified swarm optimization (iSSO) method is therefore proposed. The iSSO scheme designs the new update mechanism and survival of the fittest policy. The experimental results from the demonstration project on DongAo Island reflect the effectiveness of the stand-alone modular microgrid and the economic dispatch strategy based on the iSSO method. © 2018 by the authors.},

This paper develops a stochastic Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for operational scheduling of distribution systems with dynamic and adaptive hourly reconfiguration. The effect of coordinated integration of energy storage systems and demand response programs through hourly reconfiguration on the total costs (including cost of total loss, switching cost, cost of bilateral contract with power generation owners and responsive loads, and cost of exchanging power with the wholesale market) is investigated. A novel Switching Index (SI) based on the RCS ages and critical points in the network along with the maximum number of switching actions is introduced. Due to nonlinear nature of the problem and several existing binary variables, it is basically considered as a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problem, which is transformed into a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. The satisfactory performance of the proposed model is demonstrated through its application on a modified IEEE 33-bus distribution system. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Integrated models of the quay crane assignment problem (QCAP) and the quay crane scheduling problem (QCSP) exist. However, they have shortcomings in that some do not allow movement of quay cranes between vessels, others do not take into account precedence relationships between tasks, and yet others do not avoid interference between quay cranes. Here, an integrated and comprehensive optimization model that combines the two distinct QCAP and QCSP problems which deals with the issues raised is put forward. The model is of the mixed-integer programming type with the objective being to minimize the difference between tardiness cost and earliness income based on finishing time and requested departure time for a vessel. Because of the extent of the model and the potential for even small problems to lead to large instances, exact methods can be prohibitive in computational time. For this reason an adapted genetic algorithm (GA) is implemented to cope with this computational burden. Experimental results obtained with branch-and-cut as implemented in CPLEX and GA for small to large-scale problem instances are presented. The paper also includes a review of the relevant literature. © 2017 Operational Research Society.},

Scenario analyses were conducted with the proportion of the farm to be harvested altered.

Multi-parametric programming theory forms an active field of research and has proven to provide invaluable tools for decision making under uncertainty. While uncertainty in the right-hand side (RHS) and in the objective function's coefficients (OFC) have been thoroughly studied in the literature, the case of left-hand side (LHS) uncertainty has attracted significantly less attention mainly because of the computational implications that arise in such a problem. In the present work, we propose a novel algorithm for the analytical solution of multi-parametric MILP (mp-MILP) problems under global uncertainty, i.e. RHS, OFC and LHS. The exact explicit solutions and the corresponding regions of the parametric space are computed while a number of case studies illustrates the merits of the proposed algorithm. © 2018 The Authors},

	abstract = {Presently, residential electricity consumers are, in general, charged at flat or dual time-of-use tariffs along the day, which are defined by the retailer for long periods (e.g., one year). These pricing schemes do not convey price signals reflecting generation costs and grid conditions. Hence, consumers lack the incentives to engage in different consumption patterns using the flexibility they generally have in the operation of some end-use loads. Dynamic tariffs, i.e. energy prices varying possibly with significant magnitude in short periods of time, are expected to become an applicable pricing scheme in smart grids. In this setting, home energy management systems can play an important role to help end-users optimizing the usage of appliances to minimize energy costs without compromising comfort. This can be advantageous also from the perspective of grid management. A semivectorial bilevel programming approach is developed to model the interaction between electricity retailers and consumers in order to optimize electricity time-of-use retail pricing. The aim is to support the retailer in finding good decisions for the prices. The retailer (upper level decision maker) establishes dynamic time-of-use electricity prices to maximize profits. The consumer (lower level decision maker) responds by selecting, under that price setting, a load scheduling decision leading to a nondominated solution balancing his objectives of minimizing the electricity bill (cost dimension) and minimizing the dissatisfaction in face of his preferences and requirements (comfort dimension). The lower level optimization problem is formulated as a bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming problem. A hybrid approach is proposed, which consists of a genetic algorithm for the upper level problem and an exact solver to solve surrogate scalar problems at the lower level. A case study is presented and discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

In this instance, the goal of satellite constellation task scheduling is to allocate each task for the satellites and to determine the task starting times in order to maximize the overall mission performance metric. The scheduling problem is formulated to find the solution by first finding a set of candidate communication time intervals for each satellite/ground-station pair as one of the key constraints and time tabling the observation task to acquire the user-requested data, with the incorporation of key constraints for satellite constellation operation. Numerical experiments are designed for investigating the trends, sensitivity, and characteristics of scheduling outputs based on multiple representative instances. The performance of the scheduling solutions by the proposed two-step binary linear programming method exhibits significant improvement of up to 35% in the number of assignments and the sum of profits over the general greedy algorithm. © 2018 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

	abstract = {With continuous technological improvement and economic development of energy storage, distributed energy storage (DES) will be widely connected to the distribution network. If fragmented DES systems are aggregated to form a distributed energy storage aggregator (DESA), the DESA will have great potential to participate in the day-ahead energy and reserve market and the balancing market. The DESA could act as a mediator between the market and DES consumers, enabling beneficial coordination for DES owners and power systems. This paper presents a bilevel optimization model for DESAs in the energy and reserve market under wind power uncertainties. In the lower-level problem, generating companies, wind power plants (WPP), and DESAs are optimized for scheduling day-ahead (DA) energy and the reserve market. In the upper-level problem, operational strategies for DES systems and DESAs are designed to deal with wind power uncertainties in the balancing market. The DESA splits its resources between the energy and reserve markets so that it can reduce total power system consumption, and mutual profit for the system and end customers is achieved. This model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) program, which can be solved with commercial software. The validity of the bilevel optimization model is verified by the eight-node test transmission system and IEEE-33 bus distribution system. © 2018 by the authors.},

This work presents a methodology to exploit the demand flexibility of energy-intensive industries under Demand-Side Management programs in the energy and reserve markets. To this end, we propose a novel scheduling model for a multi-stage multi-line process, which incorporates both the critical manufacturing constraints and the technical requirements imposed by the market. Using mixed integer programming approach, two optimization problems are formulated to sequentially minimize the cost in a day-ahead energy market and maximize the reserve provision when participating in the ancillary market. The effectiveness of day-ahead scheduling model has been verified for the case of a real metal casting plant in the Nordic market, where a significant reduction of energy cost is obtained. Furthermore, the reserve provision is shown to be a potential tool for capitalizing on the reserve market as a secondary revenue stream. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Recently, the concept of energy hub and its corresponding management systems has been proposed in multi-carrier energy systems. The presented study develops a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear programming model for a day-ahead energy scheduling of a multi-carrier energy system, considering the time-varying energy price signals and volatility feature of renewable energy resources. In the framework of the proposed method, the objective is set to minimise the energy hub's total cost, while finding the optimal values for decision variables. A set of valid scenarios is considered for the uncertainties of loads and solar energy resources. Finally, the proposed stochastic day-ahead optimisation is tested in a case study situation. In the process of minimising the operational cost, an energy hub operator is able to fix some decisions such as energy exchange with the main grid and unit commitment, before the actual realisation of the uncertain parameters is observed. The unit commitment results also are compared with those produced by a deterministic model for the case in which the electricity flow is bidirectional. © 2017, The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

Among various low-carbon technologies, gas-fired power plants and power-to-gas facilities play an important role to reduce emissions, and they are increasing the interdependency between electricity and natural gas systems. Considering also the increasing penetration of wind power generation, this paper proposes a low-carbon economic dispatch model under both constraints of the electricity and natural gas systems. To reduce CO2 emission and improve the wind power utilization, mathematical formulations of the post-combustion carbon capture system and power-to-gas facility are presented in the proposed model. Additionally, a flexible operation mode of post-combustion carbon capture system and power-to-gas facility is further analyzed. The objective function of the presented model is to minimize the total cost, which consists of the operation cost, the CO2 processing cost and the penalty cost of wind power curtailment. Then the optimization model is converted into a mixed integer linear programming problem for efficient computation purpose. Numerical case studies are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the flexible operation mode. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Dynamic economic dispatch with valve-point effects (DED-VPE) is a non-convex and non-differentiable optimization problem that is difficult to solve efficiently. In this paper, a hybrid approach combining mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and the interior point method (IPM), abbreviated as MILP-IPM, is proposed to solve a DED-VPE problem in which complicated transmission loss is also included. Due to the non-differentiable nature of the DED-VPE problem, the classical derivative-based optimization methods can no longer be used. With the help of model reformulation, a differentiable non-linear programming (NLP) formulation that can be directly solved using the IPM is derived. However, if the DED-VPE problem is solved using the IPM in a single step, the optimization can easily become trapped in a poor local optimum due to its non-convex nature and multiple local minima. To obtain a better solution, an MILP method is required to solve the DED-VPE problem without transmission loss, yielding a good initial point for the IPM to improve the quality of the solution. Simulation results demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed MILP-IPM approach for solving the DED-VPE problem. © 2017},

	abstract = {Resource leveling is important in project management as resource fluctuations are costly and undesired. Typically, schedules with better resource profiles are obtained by shifting the activities within their float times using the schedule of fixed duration found by Critical Path Method. However, if the project duration can be extended, it is plausible to find a schedule with enhanced resource leveling since a longer duration allows for more float time for all activities. In this work, we relax the assumption of fixed durations in resource leveling formulations and investigate what the minimal project duration for the best leveled schedule should be. We provide mixed-integer linear models for several leveling objectives including the Release and Rehire metric. We show that not all metrics used for leveling under fixed durations may be appropriate when the project duration becomes a decision variable. Optimal solutions from smaller problems are used to find the magnitude of the extension needed and benefits obtained thereby. Since the problem is a NP-hard problem for which exact solutions cannot be obtained for large networks in reasonable time, we provide a greedy heuristic to be used with the Release and Rehire metric. Using an iterative framework, we also test the performance of a state-of-the-art heuristic algorithm from the literature on our problem. Computational experiments indicate that the more the number of resources is increased, the less leveling benefits are gained from extending the project. The optimal project durations and extension benefits can also be significantly different for different metrics. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {We propose three novel mathematical optimization formulations that solve the same two-type heterogeneous multiprocessor scheduling problem for a real-time taskset with hard constraints. Our formulations are based on a global scheduling scheme and a fluid model. The first formulation is a mixed-integer nonlinear program, since the scheduling problem is intuitively considered as an assignment problem. However, by changing the scheduling problem to first determine a task workload partition and then to find the execution order of all tasks, the computation time can be significantly reduced. Specifically, the workload partitioning problem can be formulated as a continuous nonlinear program for a system with continuous operating frequency, and as a continuous linear program for a practical system with a discrete speed level set. The latter problem can therefore be solved by an interior point method to any accuracy in polynomial time. The task ordering problem can be solved by an algorithm with a complexity that is linear in the total number of tasks. The work is evaluated against existing global energy/feasibility optimal workload allocation formulations. The results illustrate that our algorithms are both feasibility optimal and energy optimal for both implicit and constrained deadline tasksets. Specifically, our algorithm can achieve up to 40% energy saving for some simulated tasksets with constrained deadlines. The benefit of our formulation compared with existing work is that our algorithms can solve a more general class of scheduling problems due to incorporating a scheduling dynamic model in the formulations and allowing for a time-varying speed profile. © 2017, The Author(s).},
